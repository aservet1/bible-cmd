1 Corinthians 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
1 Corinthians 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
1 Corinthians 15:5  And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:
1 Corinthians 15:6  After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.
1 Corinthians 15:7  After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.
1 Corinthians 15:8  And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.
1 Corinthians 15:9  For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
