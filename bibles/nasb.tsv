Genesis	Ge	1	1	1	In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
Genesis	Ge	1	1	2	The earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the waters.
Genesis	Ge	1	1	3	Then God said, "Let there be light"; and there was light.
Genesis	Ge	1	1	4	God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness.
Genesis	Ge	1	1	5	God called the light day, and the darkness He called night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.
Genesis	Ge	1	1	6	Then God said, "Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters."
Genesis	Ge	1	1	7	God made the expanse, and separated the waters which were below the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so.
Genesis	Ge	1	1	8	God called the expanse heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.
Genesis	Ge	1	1	9	Then God said, "Let the waters below the heavens be gathered into one place, and let the dry land appear"; and it was so.
Genesis	Ge	1	1	10	God called the dry land earth, and the gathering of the waters He called seas; and God saw that it was good.
Genesis	Ge	1	1	11	Then God said, "Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees on the earth bearing fruit after their kind with seed in them"; and it was so.
Genesis	Ge	1	1	12	The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit with seed in them, after their kind; and God saw that it was good.
Genesis	Ge	1	1	13	There was evening and there was morning, a third day.
Genesis	Ge	1	1	14	Then God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night, and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years;
Genesis	Ge	1	1	15	and let them be for lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth"; and it was so.
Genesis	Ge	1	1	16	God made the two great lights, the greater light to govern the day, and the lesser light to govern the night; He made the stars also.
Genesis	Ge	1	1	17	God placed them in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth,
Genesis	Ge	1	1	18	and to govern the day and the night, and to separate the light from the darkness; and God saw that it was good.
Genesis	Ge	1	1	19	There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.
Genesis	Ge	1	1	20	Then God said, "Let the waters teem with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the heavens."
Genesis	Ge	1	1	21	God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind; and God saw that it was good.
Genesis	Ge	1	1	22	God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth."
Genesis	Ge	1	1	23	There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.
Genesis	Ge	1	1	24	Then God said, "Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind: cattle and creeping things and beasts of the earth after their kind"; and it was so.
Genesis	Ge	1	1	25	God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind; and God saw that it was good.
Genesis	Ge	1	1	26	Then God said, "Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."
Genesis	Ge	1	1	27	God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.
Genesis	Ge	1	1	28	God blessed them; and God said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth."
Genesis	Ge	1	1	29	Then God said, "Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree which has fruit yielding seed; it shall be food for you;
Genesis	Ge	1	1	30	and to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the sky and to every thing that moves on the earth which has life, I have given every green plant for food"; and it was so.
Genesis	Ge	1	1	31	God saw all that He had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.
Genesis	Ge	1	2	1	Thus the heavens and the earth were completed, and all their hosts.
Genesis	Ge	1	2	2	By the seventh day God completed His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done.
Genesis	Ge	1	2	3	Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made.
Genesis	Ge	1	2	4	This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made earth and heaven.
Genesis	Ge	1	2	5	Now no shrub of the field was yet in the earth, and no plant of the field had yet sprouted, for the LORD God had not sent rain upon the earth, and there was no man to cultivate the ground.
Genesis	Ge	1	2	6	But a mist used to rise from the earth and water the whole surface of the ground.
Genesis	Ge	1	2	7	Then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.
Genesis	Ge	1	2	8	The LORD God planted a garden toward the east, in Eden; and there He placed the man whom He had formed.
Genesis	Ge	1	2	9	Out of the ground the LORD God caused to grow every tree that is pleasing to the sight and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
Genesis	Ge	1	2	10	Now a river flowed out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it divided and became four rivers.
Genesis	Ge	1	2	11	The name of the first is Pishon; it flows around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.
Genesis	Ge	1	2	12	The gold of that land is good; the bdellium and the onyx stone are there.
Genesis	Ge	1	2	13	The name of the second river is Gihon; it flows around the whole land of Cush.
Genesis	Ge	1	2	14	The name of the third river is Tigris; it flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
Genesis	Ge	1	2	15	Then the LORD God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to cultivate it and keep it.
Genesis	Ge	1	2	16	The LORD God commanded the man, saying, "From any tree of the garden you may eat freely;
Genesis	Ge	1	2	17	but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die."
Genesis	Ge	1	2	18	Then the LORD God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make him a helper suitable for him."
Genesis	Ge	1	2	19	Out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the sky, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called a living creature, that was its name.
Genesis	Ge	1	2	20	The man gave names to all the cattle, and to the birds of the sky, and to every beast of the field, but for Adam there was not found a helper suitable for him.
Genesis	Ge	1	2	21	So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; then He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh at that place.
Genesis	Ge	1	2	22	The LORD God fashioned into a woman the rib which He had taken from the man, and brought her to the man.
Genesis	Ge	1	2	23	The man said, "This is now bone of my bones, And flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken out of Man."
Genesis	Ge	1	2	24	For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother, and be joined to his wife; and they shall become one flesh.
Genesis	Ge	1	2	25	And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed.
Genesis	Ge	1	3	1	Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, "Indeed, has God said, 'You shall not eat from any tree of the garden'?"
Genesis	Ge	1	3	2	The woman said to the serpent, "From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat;
Genesis	Ge	1	3	3	but from the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, 'You shall not eat from it or touch it, or you will die.'"
Genesis	Ge	1	3	4	The serpent said to the woman, "You surely will not die!
Genesis	Ge	1	3	5	"For God knows that in the day you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."
Genesis	Ge	1	3	6	When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took from its fruit and ate; and she gave also to her husband with her, and he ate.
Genesis	Ge	1	3	7	Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loin coverings.
Genesis	Ge	1	3	8	They heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.
Genesis	Ge	1	3	9	Then the LORD God called to the man, and said to him, "Where are you?"
Genesis	Ge	1	3	10	He said, "I heard the sound of You in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid myself."
Genesis	Ge	1	3	11	And He said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?"
Genesis	Ge	1	3	12	The man said, "The woman whom You gave to be with me, she gave me from the tree, and I ate."
Genesis	Ge	1	3	13	Then the LORD God said to the woman, "What is this you have done?" And the woman said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."
Genesis	Ge	1	3	14	The LORD God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, Cursed are you more than all cattle, And more than every beast of the field; On your belly you will go, And dust you will eat All the days of your life;
Genesis	Ge	1	3	15	And I will put enmity Between you and the woman, And between your seed and her seed; He shall bruise you on the head, And you shall bruise him on the heel."
Genesis	Ge	1	3	16	To the woman He said, "I will greatly multiply Your pain in childbirth, In pain you will bring forth children; Yet your desire will be for your husband, And he will rule over you."
Genesis	Ge	1	3	17	Then to Adam He said, "Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree about which I commanded you, saying, 'You shall not eat from it'; Cursed is the ground because of you; In toil you will eat of it All the days of your life.
Genesis	Ge	1	3	18	"Both thorns and thistles it shall grow for you; And you will eat the plants of the field;
Genesis	Ge	1	3	19	By the sweat of your face You will eat bread, Till you return to the ground, Because from it you were taken; For you are dust, And to dust you shall return."
Genesis	Ge	1	3	20	Now the man called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all the living.
Genesis	Ge	1	3	21	The LORD God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife, and clothed them.
Genesis	Ge	1	3	22	Then the LORD God said, "Behold, the man has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil; and now, he might stretch out his hand, and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever"--
Genesis	Ge	1	3	23	therefore the LORD God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to cultivate the ground from which he was taken.
Genesis	Ge	1	3	24	So He drove the man out; and at the east of the garden of Eden He stationed the cherubim and the flaming sword which turned every direction to guard the way to the tree of life.
Genesis	Ge	1	4	1	Now the man had relations with his wife Eve, and she conceived and gave birth to Cain, and she said, "I have gotten a manchild with the help of the LORD."
Genesis	Ge	1	4	2	Again, she gave birth to his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of flocks, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
Genesis	Ge	1	4	3	So it came about in the course of time that Cain brought an offering to the LORD of the fruit of the ground.
Genesis	Ge	1	4	4	Abel, on his part also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of their fat portions. And the LORD had regard for Abel and for his offering;
Genesis	Ge	1	4	5	but for Cain and for his offering He had no regard. So Cain became very angry and his countenance fell.
Genesis	Ge	1	4	6	Then the LORD said to Cain, "Why are you angry? And why has your countenance fallen?
Genesis	Ge	1	4	7	"If you do well, will not your countenance be lifted up? And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door; and its desire is for you, but you must master it."
Genesis	Ge	1	4	8	Cain told Abel his brother. And it came about when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him.
Genesis	Ge	1	4	9	Then the LORD said to Cain, "Where is Abel your brother?" And he said, "I do not know. Am I my brother's keeper?"
Genesis	Ge	1	4	10	He said, "What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood is crying to Me from the ground.
Genesis	Ge	1	4	11	"Now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.
Genesis	Ge	1	4	12	"When you cultivate the ground, it will no longer yield its strength to you; you will be a vagrant and a wanderer on the earth."
Genesis	Ge	1	4	13	Cain said to the LORD, "My punishment is too great to bear!
Genesis	Ge	1	4	14	"Behold, You have driven me this day from the face of the ground; and from Your face I will be hidden, and I will be a vagrant and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me."
Genesis	Ge	1	4	15	So the LORD said to him, "Therefore whoever kills Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold." And the LORD appointed a sign for Cain, so that no one finding him would slay him.
Genesis	Ge	1	4	16	Then Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
Genesis	Ge	1	4	17	Cain had relations with his wife and she conceived, and gave birth to Enoch; and he built a city, and called the name of the city Enoch, after the name of his son.
Genesis	Ge	1	4	18	Now to Enoch was born Irad, and Irad became the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael became the father of Methushael, and Methushael became the father of Lamech.
Genesis	Ge	1	4	19	Lamech took to himself two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other, Zillah.
Genesis	Ge	1	4	20	Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.
Genesis	Ge	1	4	21	His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe.
Genesis	Ge	1	4	22	As for Zillah, she also gave birth to Tubal-cain, the forger of all implements of bronze and iron; and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.
Genesis	Ge	1	4	23	Lamech said to his wives, "Adah and Zillah, Listen to my voice, You wives of Lamech, Give heed to my speech, For I have killed a man for wounding me; And a boy for striking me;
Genesis	Ge	1	4	24	If Cain is avenged sevenfold, Then Lamech seventy-sevenfold."
Genesis	Ge	1	4	25	Adam had relations with his wife again; and she gave birth to a son, and named him Seth, for, she said, "God has appointed me another offspring in place of Abel, for Cain killed him."
Genesis	Ge	1	4	26	To Seth, to him also a son was born; and he called his name Enosh. Then men began to call upon the name of the LORD.
Genesis	Ge	1	5	1	This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day when God created man, He made him in the likeness of God.
Genesis	Ge	1	5	2	He created them male and female, and He blessed them and named them Man in the day when they were created.
Genesis	Ge	1	5	3	When Adam had lived one hundred and thirty years, he became the father of a son in his own likeness, according to his image, and named him Seth.
Genesis	Ge	1	5	4	Then the days of Adam after he became the father of Seth were eight hundred years, and he had other sons and daughters.
Genesis	Ge	1	5	5	So all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years, and he died.
Genesis	Ge	1	5	6	Seth lived one hundred and five years, and became the father of Enosh.
Genesis	Ge	1	5	7	Then Seth lived eight hundred and seven years after he became the father of Enosh, and he had other sons and daughters.
Genesis	Ge	1	5	8	So all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years, and he died.
Genesis	Ge	1	5	9	Enosh lived ninety years, and became the father of Kenan.
Genesis	Ge	1	5	10	Then Enosh lived eight hundred and fifteen years after he became the father of Kenan, and he had other sons and daughters.
Genesis	Ge	1	5	11	So all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years, and he died.
Genesis	Ge	1	5	12	Kenan lived seventy years, and became the father of Mahalalel.
Genesis	Ge	1	5	13	Then Kenan lived eight hundred and forty years after he became the father of Mahalalel, and he had other sons and daughters.
Genesis	Ge	1	5	14	So all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years, and he died.
Genesis	Ge	1	5	15	Mahalalel lived sixty-five years, and became the father of Jared.
Genesis	Ge	1	5	16	Then Mahalalel lived eight hundred and thirty years after he became the father of Jared, and he had other sons and daughters.
Genesis	Ge	1	5	17	So all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred and ninety-five years, and he died.
Genesis	Ge	1	5	18	Jared lived one hundred and sixty-two years, and became the father of Enoch.
Genesis	Ge	1	5	19	Then Jared lived eight hundred years after he became the father of Enoch, and he had other sons and daughters.
Genesis	Ge	1	5	20	So all the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty-two years, and he died.
Genesis	Ge	1	5	21	Enoch lived sixty-five years, and became the father of Methuselah.
Genesis	Ge	1	5	22	Then Enoch walked with God three hundred years after he became the father of Methuselah, and he had other sons and daughters.
Genesis	Ge	1	5	23	So all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty-five years.
Genesis	Ge	1	5	24	Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him.
Genesis	Ge	1	5	25	Methuselah lived one hundred and eighty-seven years, and became the father of Lamech.
Genesis	Ge	1	5	26	Then Methuselah lived seven hundred and eighty-two years after he became the father of Lamech, and he had other sons and daughters.
Genesis	Ge	1	5	27	So all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred and sixty-nine years, and he died.
Genesis	Ge	1	5	28	Lamech lived one hundred and eighty-two years, and became the father of a son.
Genesis	Ge	1	5	29	Now he called his name Noah, saying, "This one will give us rest from our work and from the toil of our hands arising from the ground which the LORD has cursed."
Genesis	Ge	1	5	30	Then Lamech lived five hundred and ninety-five years after he became the father of Noah, and he had other sons and daughters.
Genesis	Ge	1	5	31	So all the days of Lamech were seven hundred and seventy-seven years, and he died.
Genesis	Ge	1	5	32	Noah was five hundred years old, and Noah became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
Genesis	Ge	1	6	1	Now it came about, when men began to multiply on the face of the land, and daughters were born to them,
Genesis	Ge	1	6	2	that the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful; and they took wives for themselves, whomever they chose.
Genesis	Ge	1	6	3	Then the LORD said, "My Spirit shall not strive with man forever, because he also is flesh; nevertheless his days shall be one hundred and twenty years."
Genesis	Ge	1	6	4	The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown.
Genesis	Ge	1	6	5	Then the LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
Genesis	Ge	1	6	6	The LORD was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart.
Genesis	Ge	1	6	7	The LORD said, "I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, from man to animals to creeping things and to birds of the sky; for I am sorry that I have made them."
Genesis	Ge	1	6	8	But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD.
Genesis	Ge	1	6	9	These are the records of the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his time; Noah walked with God.
Genesis	Ge	1	6	10	Noah became the father of three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
Genesis	Ge	1	6	11	Now the earth was corrupt in the sight of God, and the earth was filled with violence.
Genesis	Ge	1	6	12	God looked on the earth, and behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth.
Genesis	Ge	1	6	13	Then God said to Noah, "The end of all flesh has come before Me; for the earth is filled with violence because of them; and behold, I am about to destroy them with the earth.
Genesis	Ge	1	6	14	"Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood; you shall make the ark with rooms, and shall cover it inside and out with pitch.
Genesis	Ge	1	6	15	"This is how you shall make it: the length of the ark three hundred cubits, its breadth fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits.
Genesis	Ge	1	6	16	"You shall make a window for the ark, and finish it to a cubit from the top; and set the door of the ark in the side of it; you shall make it with lower, second, and third decks.
Genesis	Ge	1	6	17	"Behold, I, even I am bringing the flood of water upon the earth, to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life, from under heaven; everything that is on the earth shall perish.
Genesis	Ge	1	6	18	"But I will establish My covenant with you; and you shall enter the ark--you and your sons and your wife, and your sons' wives with you.
Genesis	Ge	1	6	19	"And of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every kind into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female.
Genesis	Ge	1	6	20	"Of the birds after their kind, and of the animals after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every kind will come to you to keep them alive.
Genesis	Ge	1	6	21	"As for you, take for yourself some of all food which is edible, and gather it to yourself; and it shall be for food for you and for them."
Genesis	Ge	1	6	22	Thus Noah did; according to all that God had commanded him, so he did.
Genesis	Ge	1	7	1	Then the LORD said to Noah, "Enter the ark, you and all your household, for you alone I have seen to be righteous before Me in this time.
Genesis	Ge	1	7	2	"You shall take with you of every clean animal by sevens, a male and his female; and of the animals that are not clean two, a male and his female;
Genesis	Ge	1	7	3	also of the birds of the sky, by sevens, male and female, to keep offspring alive on the face of all the earth.
Genesis	Ge	1	7	4	"For after seven more days, I will send rain on the earth forty days and forty nights; and I will blot out from the face of the land every living thing that I have made."
Genesis	Ge	1	7	5	Noah did according to all that the LORD had commanded him.
Genesis	Ge	1	7	6	Now Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of water came upon the earth.
Genesis	Ge	1	7	7	Then Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him entered the ark because of the water of the flood.
Genesis	Ge	1	7	8	Of clean animals and animals that are not clean and birds and everything that creeps on the ground,
Genesis	Ge	1	7	9	there went into the ark to Noah by twos, male and female, as God had commanded Noah.
Genesis	Ge	1	7	10	It came about after the seven days, that the water of the flood came upon the earth.
Genesis	Ge	1	7	11	In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day all the fountains of the great deep burst open, and the floodgates of the sky were opened.
Genesis	Ge	1	7	12	The rain fell upon the earth for forty days and forty nights.
Genesis	Ge	1	7	13	On the very same day Noah and Shem and Ham and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife and the three wives of his sons with them, entered the ark,
Genesis	Ge	1	7	14	they and every beast after its kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, all sorts of birds.
Genesis	Ge	1	7	15	So they went into the ark to Noah, by twos of all flesh in which was the breath of life.
Genesis	Ge	1	7	16	Those that entered, male and female of all flesh, entered as God had commanded him; and the LORD closed it behind him.
Genesis	Ge	1	7	17	Then the flood came upon the earth for forty days, and the water increased and lifted up the ark, so that it rose above the earth.
Genesis	Ge	1	7	18	The water prevailed and increased greatly upon the earth, and the ark floated on the surface of the water.
Genesis	Ge	1	7	19	The water prevailed more and more upon the earth, so that all the high mountains everywhere under the heavens were covered.
Genesis	Ge	1	7	20	The water prevailed fifteen cubits higher, and the mountains were covered.
Genesis	Ge	1	7	21	All flesh that moved on the earth perished, birds and cattle and beasts and every swarming thing that swarms upon the earth, and all mankind;
Genesis	Ge	1	7	22	of all that was on the dry land, all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, died.
Genesis	Ge	1	7	23	Thus He blotted out every living thing that was upon the face of the land, from man to animals to creeping things and to birds of the sky, and they were blotted out from the earth; and only Noah was left, together with those that were with him in the ark.
Genesis	Ge	1	7	24	The water prevailed upon the earth one hundred and fifty days.
Genesis	Ge	1	8	1	But God remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the cattle that were with him in the ark; and God caused a wind to pass over the earth, and the water subsided.
Genesis	Ge	1	8	2	Also the fountains of the deep and the floodgates of the sky were closed, and the rain from the sky was restrained;
Genesis	Ge	1	8	3	and the water receded steadily from the earth, and at the end of one hundred and fifty days the water decreased.
Genesis	Ge	1	8	4	In the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark rested upon the mountains of Ararat.
Genesis	Ge	1	8	5	The water decreased steadily until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains became visible.
Genesis	Ge	1	8	6	Then it came about at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made;
Genesis	Ge	1	8	7	and he sent out a raven, and it flew here and there until the water was dried up from the earth.
Genesis	Ge	1	8	8	Then he sent out a dove from him, to see if the water was abated from the face of the land;
Genesis	Ge	1	8	9	but the dove found no resting place for the sole of her foot, so she returned to him into the ark, for the water was on the surface of all the earth. Then he put out his hand and took her, and brought her into the ark to himself.
Genesis	Ge	1	8	10	So he waited yet another seven days; and again he sent out the dove from the ark.
Genesis	Ge	1	8	11	The dove came to him toward evening, and behold, in her beak was a freshly picked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the water was abated from the earth.
Genesis	Ge	1	8	12	Then he waited yet another seven days, and sent out the dove; but she did not return to him again.
Genesis	Ge	1	8	13	Now it came about in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, on the first of the month, the water was dried up from the earth. Then Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and behold, the surface of the ground was dried up.
Genesis	Ge	1	8	14	In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry.
Genesis	Ge	1	8	15	Then God spoke to Noah, saying,
Genesis	Ge	1	8	16	"Go out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and your sons' wives with you.
Genesis	Ge	1	8	17	"Bring out with you every living thing of all flesh that is with you, birds and animals and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, that they may breed abundantly on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply on the earth."
Genesis	Ge	1	8	18	So Noah went out, and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him.
Genesis	Ge	1	8	19	Every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, everything that moves on the earth, went out by their families from the ark.
Genesis	Ge	1	8	20	Then Noah built an altar to the LORD, and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
Genesis	Ge	1	8	21	The LORD smelled the soothing aroma; and the LORD said to Himself, "I will never again curse the ground on account of man, for the intent of man's heart is evil from his youth; and I will never again destroy every living thing, as I have done.
Genesis	Ge	1	8	22	"While the earth remains, Seedtime and harvest, And cold and heat, And summer and winter, And day and night Shall not cease."
Genesis	Ge	1	9	1	And God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth.
Genesis	Ge	1	9	2	"The fear of you and the terror of you will be on every beast of the earth and on every bird of the sky; with everything that creeps on the ground, and all the fish of the sea, into your hand they are given.
Genesis	Ge	1	9	3	"Every moving thing that is alive shall be food for you; I give all to you, as I gave the green plant.
Genesis	Ge	1	9	4	"Only you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood.
Genesis	Ge	1	9	5	"Surely I will require your lifeblood; from every beast I will require it. And from every man, from every man's brother I will require the life of man.
Genesis	Ge	1	9	6	"Whoever sheds man's blood, By man his blood shall be shed, For in the image of God He made man.
Genesis	Ge	1	9	7	"As for you, be fruitful and multiply; Populate the earth abundantly and multiply in it."
Genesis	Ge	1	9	8	Then God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying,
Genesis	Ge	1	9	9	"Now behold, I Myself do establish My covenant with you, and with your descendants after you;
Genesis	Ge	1	9	10	and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you; of all that comes out of the ark, even every beast of the earth.
Genesis	Ge	1	9	11	"I establish My covenant with you; and all flesh shall never again be cut off by the water of the flood, neither shall there again be a flood to destroy the earth."
Genesis	Ge	1	9	12	God said, "This is the sign of the covenant which I am making between Me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all successive generations;
Genesis	Ge	1	9	13	I set My bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a sign of a covenant between Me and the earth.
Genesis	Ge	1	9	14	"It shall come about, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow will be seen in the cloud,
Genesis	Ge	1	9	15	and I will remember My covenant, which is between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and never again shall the water become a flood to destroy all flesh.
Genesis	Ge	1	9	16	"When the bow is in the cloud, then I will look upon it, to remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth."
Genesis	Ge	1	9	17	And God said to Noah, "This is the sign of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that is on the earth."
Genesis	Ge	1	9	18	Now the sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem and Ham and Japheth; and Ham was the father of Canaan.
Genesis	Ge	1	9	19	These three were the sons of Noah, and from these the whole earth was populated.
Genesis	Ge	1	9	20	Then Noah began farming and planted a vineyard.
Genesis	Ge	1	9	21	He drank of the wine and became drunk, and uncovered himself inside his tent.
Genesis	Ge	1	9	22	Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside.
Genesis	Ge	1	9	23	But Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it upon both their shoulders and walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were turned away, so that they did not see their father's nakedness.
Genesis	Ge	1	9	24	When Noah awoke from his wine, he knew what his youngest son had done to him.
Genesis	Ge	1	9	25	So he said, "Cursed be Canaan; A servant of servants He shall be to his brothers."
Genesis	Ge	1	9	26	He also said, "Blessed be the LORD, The God of Shem; And let Canaan be his servant.
Genesis	Ge	1	9	27	"May God enlarge Japheth, And let him dwell in the tents of Shem; And let Canaan be his servant."
Genesis	Ge	1	9	28	Noah lived three hundred and fifty years after the flood.
Genesis	Ge	1	9	29	So all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years, and he died.
Genesis	Ge	1	10	1	Now these are the records of the generations of Shem, Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah; and sons were born to them after the flood.
Genesis	Ge	1	10	2	The sons of Japheth were Gomer and Magog and Madai and Javan and Tubal and Meshech and Tiras.
Genesis	Ge	1	10	3	The sons of Gomer were Ashkenaz and Riphath and Togarmah.
Genesis	Ge	1	10	4	The sons of Javan were Elishah and Tarshish, Kittim and Dodanim.
Genesis	Ge	1	10	5	From these the coastlands of the nations were separated into their lands, every one according to his language, according to their families, into their nations.
Genesis	Ge	1	10	6	The sons of Ham were Cush and Mizraim and Put and Canaan.
Genesis	Ge	1	10	7	The sons of Cush were Seba and Havilah and Sabtah and Raamah and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah were Sheba and Dedan.
Genesis	Ge	1	10	8	Now Cush became the father of Nimrod; he became a mighty one on the earth.
Genesis	Ge	1	10	9	He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; therefore it is said, "Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the LORD."
Genesis	Ge	1	10	10	The beginning of his kingdom was Babel and Erech and Accad and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
Genesis	Ge	1	10	11	From that land he went forth into Assyria, and built Nineveh and Rehoboth-Ir and Calah,
Genesis	Ge	1	10	12	and Resen between Nineveh and Calah; that is the great city.
Genesis	Ge	1	10	13	Mizraim became the father of Ludim and Anamim and Lehabim and Naphtuhim
Genesis	Ge	1	10	14	and Pathrusim and Casluhim (from which came the Philistines) and Caphtorim.
Genesis	Ge	1	10	15	Canaan became the father of Sidon, his firstborn, and Heth
Genesis	Ge	1	10	16	and the Jebusite and the Amorite and the Girgashite
Genesis	Ge	1	10	17	and the Hivite and the Arkite and the Sinite
Genesis	Ge	1	10	18	and the Arvadite and the Zemarite and the Hamathite; and afterward the families of the Canaanite were spread abroad.
Genesis	Ge	1	10	19	The territory of the Canaanite extended from Sidon as you go toward Gerar, as far as Gaza; as you go toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.
Genesis	Ge	1	10	20	These are the sons of Ham, according to their families, according to their languages, by their lands, by their nations.
Genesis	Ge	1	10	21	Also to Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, and the older brother of Japheth, children were born.
Genesis	Ge	1	10	22	The sons of Shem were Elam and Asshur and Arpachshad and Lud and Aram.
Genesis	Ge	1	10	23	The sons of Aram were Uz and Hul and Gether and Mash.
Genesis	Ge	1	10	24	Arpachshad became the father of Shelah; and Shelah became the father of Eber.
Genesis	Ge	1	10	25	Two sons were born to Eber; the name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided; and his brother's name was Joktan.
Genesis	Ge	1	10	26	Joktan became the father of Almodad and Sheleph and Hazarmaveth and Jerah
Genesis	Ge	1	10	27	and Hadoram and Uzal and Diklah
Genesis	Ge	1	10	28	and Obal and Abimael and Sheba
Genesis	Ge	1	10	29	and Ophir and Havilah and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan.
Genesis	Ge	1	10	30	Now their settlement extended from Mesha as you go toward Sephar, the hill country of the east.
Genesis	Ge	1	10	31	These are the sons of Shem, according to their families, according to their languages, by their lands, according to their nations.
Genesis	Ge	1	10	32	These are the families of the sons of Noah, according to their genealogies, by their nations; and out of these the nations were separated on the earth after the flood.
Genesis	Ge	1	11	1	Now the whole earth used the same language and the same words.
Genesis	Ge	1	11	2	It came about as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there.
Genesis	Ge	1	11	3	They said to one another, "Come, let us make bricks and burn them thoroughly." And they used brick for stone, and they used tar for mortar.
Genesis	Ge	1	11	4	They said, "Come, let us build for ourselves a city, and a tower whose top will reach into heaven, and let us make for ourselves a name, otherwise we will be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth."
Genesis	Ge	1	11	5	The LORD came down to see the city and the tower which the sons of men had built.
Genesis	Ge	1	11	6	The LORD said, "Behold, they are one people, and they all have the same language. And this is what they began to do, and now nothing which they purpose to do will be impossible for them.
Genesis	Ge	1	11	7	"Come, let Us go down and there confuse their language, so that they will not understand one another's speech."
Genesis	Ge	1	11	8	So the LORD scattered them abroad from there over the face of the whole earth; and they stopped building the city.
Genesis	Ge	1	11	9	Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the LORD confused the language of the whole earth; and from there the LORD scattered them abroad over the face of the whole earth.
Genesis	Ge	1	11	10	These are the records of the generations of Shem. Shem was one hundred years old, and became the father of Arpachshad two years after the flood;
Genesis	Ge	1	11	11	and Shem lived five hundred years after he became the father of Arpachshad, and he had other sons and daughters.
Genesis	Ge	1	11	12	Arpachshad lived thirty-five years, and became the father of Shelah;
Genesis	Ge	1	11	13	and Arpachshad lived four hundred and three years after he became the father of Shelah, and he had other sons and daughters.
Genesis	Ge	1	11	14	Shelah lived thirty years, and became the father of Eber;
Genesis	Ge	1	11	15	and Shelah lived four hundred and three years after he became the father of Eber, and he had other sons and daughters.
Genesis	Ge	1	11	16	Eber lived thirty-four years, and became the father of Peleg;
Genesis	Ge	1	11	17	and Eber lived four hundred and thirty years after he became the father of Peleg, and he had other sons and daughters.
Genesis	Ge	1	11	18	Peleg lived thirty years, and became the father of Reu;
Genesis	Ge	1	11	19	and Peleg lived two hundred and nine years after he became the father of Reu, and he had other sons and daughters.
Genesis	Ge	1	11	20	Reu lived thirty-two years, and became the father of Serug;
Genesis	Ge	1	11	21	and Reu lived two hundred and seven years after he became the father of Serug, and he had other sons and daughters.
Genesis	Ge	1	11	22	Serug lived thirty years, and became the father of Nahor;
Genesis	Ge	1	11	23	and Serug lived two hundred years after he became the father of Nahor, and he had other sons and daughters.
Genesis	Ge	1	11	24	Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and became the father of Terah;
Genesis	Ge	1	11	25	and Nahor lived one hundred and nineteen years after he became the father of Terah, and he had other sons and daughters.
Genesis	Ge	1	11	26	Terah lived seventy years, and became the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran.
Genesis	Ge	1	11	27	Now these are the records of the generations of Terah. Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran; and Haran became the father of Lot.
Genesis	Ge	1	11	28	Haran died in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldeans.
Genesis	Ge	1	11	29	Abram and Nahor took wives for themselves. The name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah and Iscah.
Genesis	Ge	1	11	30	Sarai was barren; she had no child.
Genesis	Ge	1	11	31	Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his grandson, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife; and they went out together from Ur of the Chaldeans in order to enter the land of Canaan; and they went as far as Haran, and settled there.
Genesis	Ge	1	11	32	The days of Terah were two hundred and five years; and Terah died in Haran.
Genesis	Ge	1	12	1	Now the LORD said to Abram, "Go forth from your country, And from your relatives And from your father's house, To the land which I will show you;
Genesis	Ge	1	12	2	And I will make you a great nation, And I will bless you, And make your name great; And so you shall be a blessing;
Genesis	Ge	1	12	3	And I will bless those who bless you, And the one who curses you I will curse. And in you all the families of the earth will be blessed."
Genesis	Ge	1	12	4	So Abram went forth as the LORD had spoken to him; and Lot went with him. Now Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran.
Genesis	Ge	1	12	5	Abram took Sarai his wife and Lot his nephew, and all their possessions which they had accumulated, and the persons which they had acquired in Haran, and they set out for the land of Canaan; thus they came to the land of Canaan.
Genesis	Ge	1	12	6	Abram passed through the land as far as the site of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. Now the Canaanite was then in the land.
Genesis	Ge	1	12	7	The LORD appeared to Abram and said, "To your descendants I will give this land." So he built an altar there to the LORD who had appeared to him.
Genesis	Ge	1	12	8	Then he proceeded from there to the mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east; and there he built an altar to the LORD and called upon the name of the LORD.
Genesis	Ge	1	12	9	Abram journeyed on, continuing toward the Negev.
Genesis	Ge	1	12	10	Now there was a famine in the land; so Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land.
Genesis	Ge	1	12	11	It came about when he came near to Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, "See now, I know that you are a beautiful woman;
Genesis	Ge	1	12	12	and when the Egyptians see you, they will say, 'This is his wife'; and they will kill me, but they will let you live.
Genesis	Ge	1	12	13	"Please say that you are my sister so that it may go well with me because of you, and that I may live on account of you."
Genesis	Ge	1	12	14	It came about when Abram came into Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful.
Genesis	Ge	1	12	15	Pharaoh's officials saw her and praised her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
Genesis	Ge	1	12	16	Therefore he treated Abram well for her sake; and gave him sheep and oxen and donkeys and male and female servants and female donkeys and camels.
Genesis	Ge	1	12	17	But the LORD struck Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife.
Genesis	Ge	1	12	18	Then Pharaoh called Abram and said, "What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife?
Genesis	Ge	1	12	19	"Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her for my wife? Now then, here is your wife, take her and go."
Genesis	Ge	1	12	20	Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him; and they escorted him away, with his wife and all that belonged to him.
Genesis	Ge	1	13	1	So Abram went up from Egypt to the Negev, he and his wife and all that belonged to him, and Lot with him.
Genesis	Ge	1	13	2	Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver and in gold.
Genesis	Ge	1	13	3	He went on his journeys from the Negev as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,
Genesis	Ge	1	13	4	to the place of the altar which he had made there formerly; and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.
Genesis	Ge	1	13	5	Now Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents.
Genesis	Ge	1	13	6	And the land could not sustain them while dwelling together, for their possessions were so great that they were not able to remain together.
Genesis	Ge	1	13	7	And there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram's livestock and the herdsmen of Lot's livestock. Now the Canaanite and the Perizzite were dwelling then in the land.
Genesis	Ge	1	13	8	So Abram said to Lot, "Please let there be no strife between you and me, nor between my herdsmen and your herdsmen, for we are brothers.
Genesis	Ge	1	13	9	"Is not the whole land before you? Please separate from me; if to the left, then I will go to the right; or if to the right, then I will go to the left."
Genesis	Ge	1	13	10	Lot lifted up his eyes and saw all the valley of the Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere--this was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah--like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt as you go to Zoar.
Genesis	Ge	1	13	11	So Lot chose for himself all the valley of the Jordan, and Lot journeyed eastward. Thus they separated from each other.
Genesis	Ge	1	13	12	Abram settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled in the cities of the valley, and moved his tents as far as Sodom.
Genesis	Ge	1	13	13	Now the men of Sodom were wicked exceedingly and sinners against the LORD.
Genesis	Ge	1	13	14	The LORD said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, "Now lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward;
Genesis	Ge	1	13	15	for all the land which you see, I will give it to you and to your descendants forever.
Genesis	Ge	1	13	16	"I will make your descendants as the dust of the earth, so that if anyone can number the dust of the earth, then your descendants can also be numbered.
Genesis	Ge	1	13	17	"Arise, walk about the land through its length and breadth; for I will give it to you."
Genesis	Ge	1	13	18	Then Abram moved his tent and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and there he built an altar to the LORD.
Genesis	Ge	1	14	1	And it came about in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim,
Genesis	Ge	1	14	2	that they made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar).
Genesis	Ge	1	14	3	All these came as allies to the valley of Siddim (that is, the Salt Sea).
Genesis	Ge	1	14	4	Twelve years they had served Chedorlaomer, but the thirteenth year they rebelled.
Genesis	Ge	1	14	5	In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him, came and defeated the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim and the Zuzim in Ham and the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,
Genesis	Ge	1	14	6	and the Horites in their Mount Seir, as far as El-paran, which is by the wilderness.
Genesis	Ge	1	14	7	Then they turned back and came to En-mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and conquered all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, who lived in Hazazon-tamar.
Genesis	Ge	1	14	8	And the king of Sodom and the king of Gomorrah and the king of Admah and the king of Zeboiim and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) came out; and they arrayed for battle against them in the valley of Siddim,
Genesis	Ge	1	14	9	against Chedorlaomer king of Elam and Tidal king of Goiim and Amraphel king of Shinar and Arioch king of Ellasar--four kings against five.
Genesis	Ge	1	14	10	Now the valley of Siddim was full of tar pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell into them. But those who survived fled to the hill country.
Genesis	Ge	1	14	11	Then they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food supply, and departed.
Genesis	Ge	1	14	12	They also took Lot, Abram's nephew, and his possessions and departed, for he was living in Sodom.
Genesis	Ge	1	14	13	Then a fugitive came and told Abram the Hebrew. Now he was living by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and brother of Aner, and these were allies with Abram.
Genesis	Ge	1	14	14	When Abram heard that his relative had been taken captive, he led out his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and went in pursuit as far as Dan.
Genesis	Ge	1	14	15	He divided his forces against them by night, he and his servants, and defeated them, and pursued them as far as Hobah, which is north of Damascus.
Genesis	Ge	1	14	16	He brought back all the goods, and also brought back his relative Lot with his possessions, and also the women, and the people.
Genesis	Ge	1	14	17	Then after his return from the defeat of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the valley of Shaveh (that is, the King's Valley).
Genesis	Ge	1	14	18	And Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine; now he was a priest of God Most High.
Genesis	Ge	1	14	19	He blessed him and said, "Blessed be Abram of God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth;
Genesis	Ge	1	14	20	And blessed be God Most High, Who has delivered your enemies into your hand." He gave him a tenth of all.
Genesis	Ge	1	14	21	The king of Sodom said to Abram, "Give the people to me and take the goods for yourself."
Genesis	Ge	1	14	22	Abram said to the king of Sodom, "I have sworn to the LORD God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth,
Genesis	Ge	1	14	23	that I will not take a thread or a sandal thong or anything that is yours, for fear you would say, 'I have made Abram rich.'
Genesis	Ge	1	14	24	"I will take nothing except what the young men have eaten, and the share of the men who went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their share."
Genesis	Ge	1	15	1	After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, saying, "Do not fear, Abram, I am a shield to you; Your reward shall be very great."
Genesis	Ge	1	15	2	Abram said, "O Lord GOD, what will You give me, since I am childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?"
Genesis	Ge	1	15	3	And Abram said, "Since You have given no offspring to me, one born in my house is my heir."
Genesis	Ge	1	15	4	Then behold, the word of the LORD came to him, saying, "This man will not be your heir; but one who will come forth from your own body, he shall be your heir."
Genesis	Ge	1	15	5	And He took him outside and said, "Now look toward the heavens, and count the stars, if you are able to count them." And He said to him, "So shall your descendants be."
Genesis	Ge	1	15	6	Then he believed in the LORD; and He reckoned it to him as righteousness.
Genesis	Ge	1	15	7	And He said to him, "I am the LORD who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to possess it."
Genesis	Ge	1	15	8	He said, "O Lord GOD, how may I know that I will possess it?"
Genesis	Ge	1	15	9	So He said to him, "Bring Me a three year old heifer, and a three year old female goat, and a three year old ram, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon."
Genesis	Ge	1	15	10	Then he brought all these to Him and cut them in two, and laid each half opposite the other; but he did not cut the birds.
Genesis	Ge	1	15	11	The birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, and Abram drove them away.
Genesis	Ge	1	15	12	Now when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and behold, terror and great darkness fell upon him.
Genesis	Ge	1	15	13	God said to Abram, "Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a land that is not theirs, where they will be enslaved and oppressed four hundred years.
Genesis	Ge	1	15	14	"But I will also judge the nation whom they will serve, and afterward they will come out with many possessions.
Genesis	Ge	1	15	15	"As for you, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you will be buried at a good old age.
Genesis	Ge	1	15	16	"Then in the fourth generation they will return here, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete."
Genesis	Ge	1	15	17	It came about when the sun had set, that it was very dark, and behold, there appeared a smoking oven and a flaming torch which passed between these pieces.
Genesis	Ge	1	15	18	On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, "To your descendants I have given this land, From the river of Egypt as far as the great river, the river Euphrates:
Genesis	Ge	1	15	19	the Kenite and the Kenizzite and the Kadmonite
Genesis	Ge	1	15	20	and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Rephaim
Genesis	Ge	1	15	21	and the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Girgashite and the Jebusite."
Genesis	Ge	1	16	1	Now Sarai, Abram's wife had borne him no children, and she had an Egyptian maid whose name was Hagar.
Genesis	Ge	1	16	2	So Sarai said to Abram, "Now behold, the LORD has prevented me from bearing children. Please go in to my maid; perhaps I will obtain children through her." And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.
Genesis	Ge	1	16	3	After Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, Abram's wife Sarai took Hagar the Egyptian, her maid, and gave her to her husband Abram as his wife.
Genesis	Ge	1	16	4	He went in to Hagar, and she conceived; and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her sight.
Genesis	Ge	1	16	5	And Sarai said to Abram, "May the wrong done me be upon you. I gave my maid into your arms, but when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her sight. May the LORD judge between you and me."
Genesis	Ge	1	16	6	But Abram said to Sarai, "Behold, your maid is in your power; do to her what is good in your sight." So Sarai treated her harshly, and she fled from her presence.
Genesis	Ge	1	16	7	Now the angel of the LORD found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, by the spring on the way to Shur.
Genesis	Ge	1	16	8	He said, "Hagar, Sarai's maid, where have you come from and where are you going?" And she said, "I am fleeing from the presence of my mistress Sarai."
Genesis	Ge	1	16	9	Then the angel of the LORD said to her, "Return to your mistress, and submit yourself to her authority."
Genesis	Ge	1	16	10	Moreover, the angel of the LORD said to her, "I will greatly multiply your descendants so that they will be too many to count."
Genesis	Ge	1	16	11	The angel of the LORD said to her further, "Behold, you are with child, And you will bear a son; And you shall call his name Ishmael, Because the LORD has given heed to your affliction.
Genesis	Ge	1	16	12	"He will be a wild donkey of a man, His hand will be against everyone, And everyone's hand will be against him; And he will live to the east of all his brothers."
Genesis	Ge	1	16	13	Then she called the name of the LORD who spoke to her, "You are a God who sees"; for she said, "Have I even remained alive here after seeing Him?"
Genesis	Ge	1	16	14	Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.
Genesis	Ge	1	16	15	So Hagar bore Abram a son; and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.
Genesis	Ge	1	16	16	Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to him.
Genesis	Ge	1	17	1	Now when Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to Abram and said to him, "I am God Almighty; Walk before Me, and be blameless.
Genesis	Ge	1	17	2	"I will establish My covenant between Me and you, And I will multiply you exceedingly."
Genesis	Ge	1	17	3	Abram fell on his face, and God talked with him, saying,
Genesis	Ge	1	17	4	"As for Me, behold, My covenant is with you, And you will be the father of a multitude of nations.
Genesis	Ge	1	17	5	"No longer shall your name be called Abram, But your name shall be Abraham; For I have made you the father of a multitude of nations.
Genesis	Ge	1	17	6	"I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of you, and kings will come forth from you.
Genesis	Ge	1	17	7	"I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your descendants after you.
Genesis	Ge	1	17	8	"I will give to you and to your descendants after you, the land of your sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God."
Genesis	Ge	1	17	9	God said further to Abraham, "Now as for you, you shall keep My covenant, you and your descendants after you throughout their generations.
Genesis	Ge	1	17	10	"This is My covenant, which you shall keep, between Me and you and your descendants after you: every male among you shall be circumcised.
Genesis	Ge	1	17	11	"And you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin, and it shall be the sign of the covenant between Me and you.
Genesis	Ge	1	17	12	"And every male among you who is eight days old shall be circumcised throughout your generations, a servant who is born in the house or who is bought with money from any foreigner, who is not of your descendants.
Genesis	Ge	1	17	13	"A servant who is born in your house or who is bought with your money shall surely be circumcised; thus shall My covenant be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
Genesis	Ge	1	17	14	"But an uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that person shall be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant."
Genesis	Ge	1	17	15	Then God said to Abraham, "As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name.
Genesis	Ge	1	17	16	"I will bless her, and indeed I will give you a son by her. Then I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of peoples will come from her."
Genesis	Ge	1	17	17	Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, "Will a child be born to a man one hundred years old? And will Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?"
Genesis	Ge	1	17	18	And Abraham said to God, "Oh that Ishmael might live before You!"
Genesis	Ge	1	17	19	But God said, "No, but Sarah your wife will bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaac; and I will establish My covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him.
Genesis	Ge	1	17	20	"As for Ishmael, I have heard you; behold, I will bless him, and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly. He shall become the father of twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation.
Genesis	Ge	1	17	21	"But My covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this season next year."
Genesis	Ge	1	17	22	When He finished talking with him, God went up from Abraham.
Genesis	Ge	1	17	23	Then Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all the servants who were born in his house and all who were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's household, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the very same day, as God had said to him.
Genesis	Ge	1	17	24	Now Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
Genesis	Ge	1	17	25	And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
Genesis	Ge	1	17	26	In the very same day Abraham was circumcised, and Ishmael his son.
Genesis	Ge	1	17	27	All the men of his household, who were born in the house or bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.
Genesis	Ge	1	18	1	Now the LORD appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre, while he was sitting at the tent door in the heat of the day.
Genesis	Ge	1	18	2	When he lifted up his eyes and looked, behold, three men were standing opposite him; and when he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed himself to the earth,
Genesis	Ge	1	18	3	and said, "My Lord, if now I have found favor in Your sight, please do not pass Your servant by.
Genesis	Ge	1	18	4	"Please let a little water be brought and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree;
Genesis	Ge	1	18	5	and I will bring a piece of bread, that you may refresh yourselves; after that you may go on, since you have visited your servant." And they said, "So do, as you have said."
Genesis	Ge	1	18	6	So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah, and said, "Quickly, prepare three measures of fine flour, knead it and make bread cakes."
Genesis	Ge	1	18	7	Abraham also ran to the herd, and took a tender and choice calf and gave it to the servant, and he hurried to prepare it.
Genesis	Ge	1	18	8	He took curds and milk and the calf which he had prepared, and placed it before them; and he was standing by them under the tree as they ate.
Genesis	Ge	1	18	9	Then they said to him, "Where is Sarah your wife?" And he said, "There, in the tent."
Genesis	Ge	1	18	10	He said, "I will surely return to you at this time next year; and behold, Sarah your wife will have a son." And Sarah was listening at the tent door, which was behind him.
Genesis	Ge	1	18	11	Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in age; Sarah was past childbearing.
Genesis	Ge	1	18	12	Sarah laughed to herself, saying, "After I have become old, shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?"
Genesis	Ge	1	18	13	And the LORD said to Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh, saying, 'Shall I indeed bear a child, when I am so old?'
Genesis	Ge	1	18	14	"Is anything too difficult for the LORD? At the appointed time I will return to you, at this time next year, and Sarah will have a son."
Genesis	Ge	1	18	15	Sarah denied it however, saying, "I did not laugh"; for she was afraid. And He said, "No, but you did laugh."
Genesis	Ge	1	18	16	Then the men rose up from there, and looked down toward Sodom; and Abraham was walking with them to send them off.
Genesis	Ge	1	18	17	The LORD said, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do,
Genesis	Ge	1	18	18	since Abraham will surely become a great and mighty nation, and in him all the nations of the earth will be blessed?
Genesis	Ge	1	18	19	"For I have chosen him, so that he may command his children and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing righteousness and justice, so that the LORD may bring upon Abraham what He has spoken about him."
Genesis	Ge	1	18	20	And the LORD said, "The outcry of Sodom and Gomorrah is indeed great, and their sin is exceedingly grave.
Genesis	Ge	1	18	21	"I will go down now, and see if they have done entirely according to its outcry, which has come to Me; and if not, I will know."
Genesis	Ge	1	18	22	Then the men turned away from there and went toward Sodom, while Abraham was still standing before the LORD.
Genesis	Ge	1	18	23	Abraham came near and said, "Will You indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked?
Genesis	Ge	1	18	24	"Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city; will You indeed sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous who are in it?
Genesis	Ge	1	18	25	"Far be it from You to do such a thing, to slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous and the wicked are treated alike. Far be it from You! Shall not the Judge of all the earth deal justly?"
Genesis	Ge	1	18	26	So the LORD said, "If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare the whole place on their account."
Genesis	Ge	1	18	27	And Abraham replied, "Now behold, I have ventured to speak to the Lord, although I am but dust and ashes.
Genesis	Ge	1	18	28	"Suppose the fifty righteous are lacking five, will You destroy the whole city because of five?" And He said, "I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there."
Genesis	Ge	1	18	29	He spoke to Him yet again and said, "Suppose forty are found there?" And He said, "I will not do it on account of the forty."
Genesis	Ge	1	18	30	Then he said, "Oh may the Lord not be angry, and I shall speak; suppose thirty are found there?" And He said, "I will not do it if I find thirty there."
Genesis	Ge	1	18	31	And he said, "Now behold, I have ventured to speak to the Lord; suppose twenty are found there?" And He said, "I will not destroy it on account of the twenty."
Genesis	Ge	1	18	32	Then he said, "Oh may the Lord not be angry, and I shall speak only this once; suppose ten are found there?" And He said, "I will not destroy it on account of the ten."
Genesis	Ge	1	18	33	As soon as He had finished speaking to Abraham the LORD departed, and Abraham returned to his place.
Genesis	Ge	1	19	1	Now the two angels came to Sodom in the evening as Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground.
Genesis	Ge	1	19	2	And he said, "Now behold, my lords, please turn aside into your servant's house, and spend the night, and wash your feet; then you may rise early and go on your way." They said however, "No, but we shall spend the night in the square."
Genesis	Ge	1	19	3	Yet he urged them strongly, so they turned aside to him and entered his house; and he prepared a feast for them, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.
Genesis	Ge	1	19	4	Before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter;
Genesis	Ge	1	19	5	and they called to Lot and said to him, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us that we may have relations with them."
Genesis	Ge	1	19	6	But Lot went out to them at the doorway, and shut the door behind him,
Genesis	Ge	1	19	7	and said, "Please, my brothers, do not act wickedly.
Genesis	Ge	1	19	8	"Now behold, I have two daughters who have not had relations with man; please let me bring them out to you, and do to them whatever you like; only do nothing to these men, inasmuch as they have come under the shelter of my roof."
Genesis	Ge	1	19	9	But they said, "Stand aside." Furthermore, they said, "This one came in as an alien, and already he is acting like a judge; now we will treat you worse than them." So they pressed hard against Lot and came near to break the door.
Genesis	Ge	1	19	10	But the men reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them, and shut the door.
Genesis	Ge	1	19	11	They struck the men who were at the doorway of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves trying to find the doorway.
Genesis	Ge	1	19	12	Then the two men said to Lot, "Whom else have you here? A son-in-law, and your sons, and your daughters, and whomever you have in the city, bring them out of the place;
Genesis	Ge	1	19	13	for we are about to destroy this place, because their outcry has become so great before the LORD that the LORD has sent us to destroy it."
Genesis	Ge	1	19	14	Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, and said, "Up, get out of this place, for the LORD will destroy the city." But he appeared to his sons-in-law to be jesting.
Genesis	Ge	1	19	15	When morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, "Up, take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away in the punishment of the city."
Genesis	Ge	1	19	16	But he hesitated. So the men seized his hand and the hand of his wife and the hands of his two daughters, for the compassion of the LORD was upon him; and they brought him out, and put him outside the city.
Genesis	Ge	1	19	17	When they had brought them outside, one said, "Escape for your life! Do not look behind you, and do not stay anywhere in the valley; escape to the mountains, or you will be swept away."
Genesis	Ge	1	19	18	But Lot said to them, "Oh no, my lords!
Genesis	Ge	1	19	19	"Now behold, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have magnified your lovingkindness, which you have shown me by saving my life; but I cannot escape to the mountains, for the disaster will overtake me and I will die;
Genesis	Ge	1	19	20	now behold, this town is near enough to flee to, and it is small. Please, let me escape there (is it not small?) that my life may be saved."
Genesis	Ge	1	19	21	He said to him, "Behold, I grant you this request also, not to overthrow the town of which you have spoken.
Genesis	Ge	1	19	22	"Hurry, escape there, for I cannot do anything until you arrive there." Therefore the name of the town was called Zoar.
Genesis	Ge	1	19	23	The sun had risen over the earth when Lot came to Zoar.
Genesis	Ge	1	19	24	Then the LORD rained on Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven,
Genesis	Ge	1	19	25	and He overthrew those cities, and all the valley, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground.
Genesis	Ge	1	19	26	But his wife, from behind him, looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.
Genesis	Ge	1	19	27	Now Abraham arose early in the morning and went to the place where he had stood before the LORD;
Genesis	Ge	1	19	28	and he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the valley, and he saw, and behold, the smoke of the land ascended like the smoke of a furnace.
Genesis	Ge	1	19	29	Thus it came about, when God destroyed the cities of the valley, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when He overthrew the cities in which Lot lived.
Genesis	Ge	1	19	30	Lot went up from Zoar, and stayed in the mountains, and his two daughters with him; for he was afraid to stay in Zoar; and he stayed in a cave, he and his two daughters.
Genesis	Ge	1	19	31	Then the firstborn said to the younger, "Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to come in to us after the manner of the earth.
Genesis	Ge	1	19	32	"Come, let us make our father drink wine, and let us lie with him that we may preserve our family through our father."
Genesis	Ge	1	19	33	So they made their father drink wine that night, and the firstborn went in and lay with her father; and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose.
Genesis	Ge	1	19	34	On the following day, the firstborn said to the younger, "Behold, I lay last night with my father; let us make him drink wine tonight also; then you go in and lie with him, that we may preserve our family through our father."
Genesis	Ge	1	19	35	So they made their father drink wine that night also, and the younger arose and lay with him; and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose.
Genesis	Ge	1	19	36	Thus both the daughters of Lot were with child by their father.
Genesis	Ge	1	19	37	The firstborn bore a son, and called his name Moab; he is the father of the Moabites to this day.
Genesis	Ge	1	19	38	As for the younger, she also bore a son, and called his name Ben-ammi; he is the father of the sons of Ammon to this day.
Genesis	Ge	1	20	1	Now Abraham journeyed from there toward the land of the Negev, and settled between Kadesh and Shur; then he sojourned in Gerar.
Genesis	Ge	1	20	2	Abraham said of Sarah his wife, "She is my sister." So Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.
Genesis	Ge	1	20	3	But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, "Behold, you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is married."
Genesis	Ge	1	20	4	Now Abimelech had not come near her; and he said, "Lord, will You slay a nation, even though blameless?
Genesis	Ge	1	20	5	"Did he not himself say to me, 'She is my sister'? And she herself said, 'He is my brother.' In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this."
Genesis	Ge	1	20	6	Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this, and I also kept you from sinning against Me; therefore I did not let you touch her.
Genesis	Ge	1	20	7	"Now therefore, restore the man's wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not restore her, know that you shall surely die, you and all who are yours."
Genesis	Ge	1	20	8	So Abimelech arose early in the morning and called all his servants and told all these things in their hearing; and the men were greatly frightened.
Genesis	Ge	1	20	9	Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, "What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me things that ought not to be done."
Genesis	Ge	1	20	10	And Abimelech said to Abraham, "What have you encountered, that you have done this thing?"
Genesis	Ge	1	20	11	Abraham said, "Because I thought, surely there is no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.
Genesis	Ge	1	20	12	"Besides, she actually is my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife;
Genesis	Ge	1	20	13	and it came about, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said to her, 'This is the kindness which you will show to me: everywhere we go, say of me, "He is my brother."'"
Genesis	Ge	1	20	14	Abimelech then took sheep and oxen and male and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and restored his wife Sarah to him.
Genesis	Ge	1	20	15	Abimelech said, "Behold, my land is before you; settle wherever you please."
Genesis	Ge	1	20	16	To Sarah he said, "Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver; behold, it is your vindication before all who are with you, and before all men you are cleared."
Genesis	Ge	1	20	17	Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his maids, so that they bore children.
Genesis	Ge	1	20	18	For the LORD had closed fast all the wombs of the household of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.
Genesis	Ge	1	21	1	Then the LORD took note of Sarah as He had said, and the LORD did for Sarah as He had promised.
Genesis	Ge	1	21	2	So Sarah conceived and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the appointed time of which God had spoken to him.
Genesis	Ge	1	21	3	Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.
Genesis	Ge	1	21	4	Then Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.
Genesis	Ge	1	21	5	Now Abraham was one hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.
Genesis	Ge	1	21	6	Sarah said, "God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh with me."
Genesis	Ge	1	21	7	And she said, "Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age."
Genesis	Ge	1	21	8	The child grew and was weaned, and Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.
Genesis	Ge	1	21	9	Now Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking.
Genesis	Ge	1	21	10	Therefore she said to Abraham, "Drive out this maid and her son, for the son of this maid shall not be an heir with my son Isaac."
Genesis	Ge	1	21	11	The matter distressed Abraham greatly because of his son.
Genesis	Ge	1	21	12	But God said to Abraham, "Do not be distressed because of the lad and your maid; whatever Sarah tells you, listen to her, for through Isaac your descendants shall be named.
Genesis	Ge	1	21	13	"And of the son of the maid I will make a nation also, because he is your descendant."
Genesis	Ge	1	21	14	So Abraham rose early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar, putting them on her shoulder, and gave her the boy, and sent her away. And she departed and wandered about in the wilderness of Beersheba.
Genesis	Ge	1	21	15	When the water in the skin was used up, she left the boy under one of the bushes.
Genesis	Ge	1	21	16	Then she went and sat down opposite him, about a bowshot away, for she said, "Do not let me see the boy die." And she sat opposite him, and lifted up her voice and wept.
Genesis	Ge	1	21	17	God heard the lad crying; and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, "What is the matter with you, Hagar? Do not fear, for God has heard the voice of the lad where he is.
Genesis	Ge	1	21	18	"Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him by the hand, for I will make a great nation of him."
Genesis	Ge	1	21	19	Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water; and she went and filled the skin with water and gave the lad a drink.
Genesis	Ge	1	21	20	God was with the lad, and he grew; and he lived in the wilderness and became an archer.
Genesis	Ge	1	21	21	He lived in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.
Genesis	Ge	1	21	22	Now it came about at that time that Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, spoke to Abraham, saying, "God is with you in all that you do;
Genesis	Ge	1	21	23	now therefore, swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my offspring or with my posterity, but according to the kindness that I have shown to you, you shall show to me and to the land in which you have sojourned."
Genesis	Ge	1	21	24	Abraham said, "I swear it."
Genesis	Ge	1	21	25	But Abraham complained to Abimelech because of the well of water which the servants of Abimelech had seized.
Genesis	Ge	1	21	26	And Abimelech said, "I do not know who has done this thing; you did not tell me, nor did I hear of it until today."
Genesis	Ge	1	21	27	Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two of them made a covenant.
Genesis	Ge	1	21	28	Then Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
Genesis	Ge	1	21	29	Abimelech said to Abraham, "What do these seven ewe lambs mean, which you have set by themselves?"
Genesis	Ge	1	21	30	He said, "You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand so that it may be a witness to me, that I dug this well."
Genesis	Ge	1	21	31	Therefore he called that place Beersheba, because there the two of them took an oath.
Genesis	Ge	1	21	32	So they made a covenant at Beersheba; and Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, arose and returned to the land of the Philistines.
Genesis	Ge	1	21	33	Abraham planted a tamarisk tree at Beersheba, and there he called on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God.
Genesis	Ge	1	21	34	And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines for many days.
Genesis	Ge	1	22	1	Now it came about after these things, that God tested Abraham, and said to him, "Abraham!" And he said, "Here I am."
Genesis	Ge	1	22	2	He said, "Take now your son, your only son, whom you love, Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I will tell you."
Genesis	Ge	1	22	3	So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son; and he split wood for the burnt offering, and arose and went to the place of which God had told him.
Genesis	Ge	1	22	4	On the third day Abraham raised his eyes and saw the place from a distance.
Genesis	Ge	1	22	5	Abraham said to his young men, "Stay here with the donkey, and I and the lad will go over there; and we will worship and return to you."
Genesis	Ge	1	22	6	Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son, and he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So the two of them walked on together.
Genesis	Ge	1	22	7	Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, "My father!" And he said, "Here I am, my son." And he said, "Behold, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?"
Genesis	Ge	1	22	8	Abraham said, "God will provide for Himself the lamb for the burnt offering, my son." So the two of them walked on together.
Genesis	Ge	1	22	9	Then they came to the place of which God had told him; and Abraham built the altar there and arranged the wood, and bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood.
Genesis	Ge	1	22	10	Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.
Genesis	Ge	1	22	11	But the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven and said, "Abraham, Abraham!" And he said, "Here I am."
Genesis	Ge	1	22	12	He said, "Do not stretch out your hand against the lad, and do nothing to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me."
Genesis	Ge	1	22	13	Then Abraham raised his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns; and Abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the place of his son.
Genesis	Ge	1	22	14	Abraham called the name of that place The LORD Will Provide, as it is said to this day, "In the mount of the LORD it will be provided."
Genesis	Ge	1	22	15	Then the angel of the LORD called to Abraham a second time from heaven,
Genesis	Ge	1	22	16	and said, "By Myself I have sworn, declares the LORD, because you have done this thing and have not withheld your son, your only son,
Genesis	Ge	1	22	17	indeed I will greatly bless you, and I will greatly multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens and as the sand which is on the seashore; and your seed shall possess the gate of their enemies.
Genesis	Ge	1	22	18	"In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice."
Genesis	Ge	1	22	19	So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham lived at Beersheba.
Genesis	Ge	1	22	20	Now it came about after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, "Behold, Milcah also has borne children to your brother Nahor:
Genesis	Ge	1	22	21	Uz his firstborn and Buz his brother and Kemuel the father of Aram
Genesis	Ge	1	22	22	and Chesed and Hazo and Pildash and Jidlaph and Bethuel."
Genesis	Ge	1	22	23	Bethuel became the father of Rebekah; these eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham's brother.
Genesis	Ge	1	22	24	His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah and Gaham and Tahash and Maacah.
Genesis	Ge	1	23	1	Now Sarah lived one hundred and twenty-seven years; these were the years of the life of Sarah.
Genesis	Ge	1	23	2	Sarah died in Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan; and Abraham went in to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her.
Genesis	Ge	1	23	3	Then Abraham rose from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying,
Genesis	Ge	1	23	4	"I am a stranger and a sojourner among you; give me a burial site among you that I may bury my dead out of my sight."
Genesis	Ge	1	23	5	The sons of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,
Genesis	Ge	1	23	6	"Hear us, my lord, you are a mighty prince among us; bury your dead in the choicest of our graves; none of us will refuse you his grave for burying your dead."
Genesis	Ge	1	23	7	So Abraham rose and bowed to the people of the land, the sons of Heth.
Genesis	Ge	1	23	8	And he spoke with them, saying, "If it is your wish for me to bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and approach Ephron the son of Zohar for me,
Genesis	Ge	1	23	9	that he may give me the cave of Machpelah which he owns, which is at the end of his field; for the full price let him give it to me in your presence for a burial site."
Genesis	Ge	1	23	10	Now Ephron was sitting among the sons of Heth; and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the sons of Heth; even of all who went in at the gate of his city, saying,
Genesis	Ge	1	23	11	"No, my lord, hear me; I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the presence of the sons of my people I give it to you; bury your dead."
Genesis	Ge	1	23	12	And Abraham bowed before the people of the land.
Genesis	Ge	1	23	13	He spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying, "If you will only please listen to me; I will give the price of the field, accept it from me that I may bury my dead there."
Genesis	Ge	1	23	14	Then Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,
Genesis	Ge	1	23	15	"My lord, listen to me; a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that between me and you? So bury your dead."
Genesis	Ge	1	23	16	Abraham listened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed out for Ephron the silver which he had named in the hearing of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, commercial standard.
Genesis	Ge	1	23	17	So Ephron's field, which was in Machpelah, which faced Mamre, the field and cave which was in it, and all the trees which were in the field, that were within all the confines of its border, were deeded over
Genesis	Ge	1	23	18	to Abraham for a possession in the presence of the sons of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city.
Genesis	Ge	1	23	19	After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field at Machpelah facing Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan.
Genesis	Ge	1	23	20	So the field and the cave that is in it, were deeded over to Abraham for a burial site by the sons of Heth.
Genesis	Ge	1	24	1	Now Abraham was old, advanced in age; and the LORD had blessed Abraham in every way.
Genesis	Ge	1	24	2	Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his household, who had charge of all that he owned, "Please place your hand under my thigh,
Genesis	Ge	1	24	3	and I will make you swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I live,
Genesis	Ge	1	24	4	but you will go to my country and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son Isaac."
Genesis	Ge	1	24	5	The servant said to him, "Suppose the woman is not willing to follow me to this land; should I take your son back to the land from where you came?"
Genesis	Ge	1	24	6	Then Abraham said to him, "Beware that you do not take my son back there!
Genesis	Ge	1	24	7	"The LORD, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house and from the land of my birth, and who spoke to me and who swore to me, saying, 'To your descendants I will give this land,' He will send His angel before you, and you will take a wife for my son from there.
Genesis	Ge	1	24	8	"But if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you will be free from this my oath; only do not take my son back there."
Genesis	Ge	1	24	9	So the servant placed his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter.
Genesis	Ge	1	24	10	Then the servant took ten camels from the camels of his master, and set out with a variety of good things of his master's in his hand; and he arose and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.
Genesis	Ge	1	24	11	He made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at evening time, the time when women go out to draw water.
Genesis	Ge	1	24	12	He said, "O LORD, the God of my master Abraham, please grant me success today, and show lovingkindness to my master Abraham.
Genesis	Ge	1	24	13	"Behold, I am standing by the spring, and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water;
Genesis	Ge	1	24	14	now may it be that the girl to whom I say, 'Please let down your jar so that I may drink,' and who answers, 'Drink, and I will water your camels also'--may she be the one whom You have appointed for Your servant Isaac; and by this I will know that You have shown lovingkindness to my master."
Genesis	Ge	1	24	15	Before he had finished speaking, behold, Rebekah who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Abraham's brother Nahor, came out with her jar on her shoulder.
Genesis	Ge	1	24	16	The girl was very beautiful, a virgin, and no man had had relations with her; and she went down to the spring and filled her jar and came up.
Genesis	Ge	1	24	17	Then the servant ran to meet her, and said, "Please let me drink a little water from your jar."
Genesis	Ge	1	24	18	She said, "Drink, my lord"; and she quickly lowered her jar to her hand, and gave him a drink.
Genesis	Ge	1	24	19	Now when she had finished giving him a drink, she said, "I will draw also for your camels until they have finished drinking."
Genesis	Ge	1	24	20	So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, and ran back to the well to draw, and she drew for all his camels.
Genesis	Ge	1	24	21	Meanwhile, the man was gazing at her in silence, to know whether the LORD had made his journey successful or not.
Genesis	Ge	1	24	22	When the camels had finished drinking, the man took a gold ring weighing a half-shekel and two bracelets for her wrists weighing ten shekels in gold,
Genesis	Ge	1	24	23	and said, "Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room for us to lodge in your father's house?"
Genesis	Ge	1	24	24	She said to him, "I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor."
Genesis	Ge	1	24	25	Again she said to him, "We have plenty of both straw and feed, and room to lodge in."
Genesis	Ge	1	24	26	Then the man bowed low and worshiped the LORD.
Genesis	Ge	1	24	27	He said, "Blessed be the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken His lovingkindness and His truth toward my master; as for me, the LORD has guided me in the way to the house of my master's brothers."
Genesis	Ge	1	24	28	Then the girl ran and told her mother's household about these things.
Genesis	Ge	1	24	29	Now Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban; and Laban ran outside to the man at the spring.
Genesis	Ge	1	24	30	When he saw the ring and the bracelets on his sister's wrists, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, "This is what the man said to me," he went to the man; and behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring.
Genesis	Ge	1	24	31	And he said, "Come in, blessed of the LORD! Why do you stand outside since I have prepared the house, and a place for the camels?"
Genesis	Ge	1	24	32	So the man entered the house. Then Laban unloaded the camels, and he gave straw and feed to the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.
Genesis	Ge	1	24	33	But when food was set before him to eat, he said, "I will not eat until I have told my business." And he said, "Speak on."
Genesis	Ge	1	24	34	So he said, "I am Abraham's servant.
Genesis	Ge	1	24	35	"The LORD has greatly blessed my master, so that he has become rich; and He has given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and servants and maids, and camels and donkeys.
Genesis	Ge	1	24	36	"Now Sarah my master's wife bore a son to my master in her old age, and he has given him all that he has.
Genesis	Ge	1	24	37	"My master made me swear, saying, 'You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live;
Genesis	Ge	1	24	38	but you shall go to my father's house and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son.'
Genesis	Ge	1	24	39	"I said to my master, 'Suppose the woman does not follow me.'
Genesis	Ge	1	24	40	"He said to me, 'The LORD, before whom I have walked, will send His angel with you to make your journey successful, and you will take a wife for my son from my relatives and from my father's house;
Genesis	Ge	1	24	41	then you will be free from my oath, when you come to my relatives; and if they do not give her to you, you will be free from my oath.'
Genesis	Ge	1	24	42	"So I came today to the spring, and said, 'O LORD, the God of my master Abraham, if now You will make my journey on which I go successful;
Genesis	Ge	1	24	43	behold, I am standing by the spring, and may it be that the maiden who comes out to draw, and to whom I say, "Please let me drink a little water from your jar";
Genesis	Ge	1	24	44	and she will say to me, "You drink, and I will draw for your camels also"; let her be the woman whom the LORD has appointed for my master's son.'
Genesis	Ge	1	24	45	"Before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder, and went down to the spring and drew, and I said to her, 'Please let me drink.'
Genesis	Ge	1	24	46	"She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder, and said, 'Drink, and I will water your camels also'; so I drank, and she watered the camels also.
Genesis	Ge	1	24	47	"Then I asked her, and said, 'Whose daughter are you?' And she said, 'The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him'; and I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her wrists.
Genesis	Ge	1	24	48	"And I bowed low and worshiped the LORD, and blessed the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who had guided me in the right way to take the daughter of my master's kinsman for his son.
Genesis	Ge	1	24	49	"So now if you are going to deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me; and if not, let me know, that I may turn to the right hand or the left."
Genesis	Ge	1	24	50	Then Laban and Bethuel replied, "The matter comes from the LORD; so we cannot speak to you bad or good.
Genesis	Ge	1	24	51	"Here is Rebekah before you, take her and go, and let her be the wife of your master's son, as the LORD has spoken."
Genesis	Ge	1	24	52	When Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed himself to the ground before the LORD.
Genesis	Ge	1	24	53	The servant brought out articles of silver and articles of gold, and garments, and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave precious things to her brother and to her mother.
Genesis	Ge	1	24	54	Then he and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night. When they arose in the morning, he said, "Send me away to my master."
Genesis	Ge	1	24	55	But her brother and her mother said, "Let the girl stay with us a few days, say ten; afterward she may go."
Genesis	Ge	1	24	56	He said to them, "Do not delay me, since the LORD has prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master."
Genesis	Ge	1	24	57	And they said, "We will call the girl and consult her wishes."
Genesis	Ge	1	24	58	Then they called Rebekah and said to her, "Will you go with this man?" And she said, "I will go."
Genesis	Ge	1	24	59	Thus they sent away their sister Rebekah and her nurse with Abraham's servant and his men.
Genesis	Ge	1	24	60	They blessed Rebekah and said to her, "May you, our sister, Become thousands of ten thousands, And may your descendants possess The gate of those who hate them."
Genesis	Ge	1	24	61	Then Rebekah arose with her maids, and they mounted the camels and followed the man. So the servant took Rebekah and departed.
Genesis	Ge	1	24	62	Now Isaac had come from going to Beer-lahai-roi; for he was living in the Negev.
Genesis	Ge	1	24	63	Isaac went out to meditate in the field toward evening; and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, camels were coming.
Genesis	Ge	1	24	64	Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac she dismounted from the camel.
Genesis	Ge	1	24	65	She said to the servant, "Who is that man walking in the field to meet us?" And the servant said, "He is my master." Then she took her veil and covered herself.
Genesis	Ge	1	24	66	The servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.
Genesis	Ge	1	24	67	Then Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and he took Rebekah, and she became his wife, and he loved her; thus Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.
Genesis	Ge	1	25	1	Now Abraham took another wife, whose name was Keturah.
Genesis	Ge	1	25	2	She bore to him Zimran and Jokshan and Medan and Midian and Ishbak and Shuah.
Genesis	Ge	1	25	3	Jokshan became the father of Sheba and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim and Letushim and Leummim.
Genesis	Ge	1	25	4	The sons of Midian were Ephah and Epher and Hanoch and Abida and Eldaah. All these were the sons of Keturah.
Genesis	Ge	1	25	5	Now Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac;
Genesis	Ge	1	25	6	but to the sons of his concubines, Abraham gave gifts while he was still living, and sent them away from his son Isaac eastward, to the land of the east.
Genesis	Ge	1	25	7	These are all the years of Abraham's life that he lived, one hundred and seventy-five years.
Genesis	Ge	1	25	8	Abraham breathed his last and died in a ripe old age, an old man and satisfied with life; and he was gathered to his people.
Genesis	Ge	1	25	9	Then his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, facing Mamre,
Genesis	Ge	1	25	10	the field which Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth; there Abraham was buried with Sarah his wife.
Genesis	Ge	1	25	11	It came about after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac lived by Beer-lahai-roi.
Genesis	Ge	1	25	12	Now these are the records of the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's maid, bore to Abraham;
Genesis	Ge	1	25	13	and these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, in the order of their birth: Nebaioth, the firstborn of Ishmael, and Kedar and Adbeel and Mibsam
Genesis	Ge	1	25	14	and Mishma and Dumah and Massa,
Genesis	Ge	1	25	15	Hadad and Tema, Jetur, Naphish and Kedemah.
Genesis	Ge	1	25	16	These are the sons of Ishmael and these are their names, by their villages, and by their camps; twelve princes according to their tribes.
Genesis	Ge	1	25	17	These are the years of the life of Ishmael, one hundred and thirty-seven years; and he breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people.
Genesis	Ge	1	25	18	They settled from Havilah to Shur which is east of Egypt as one goes toward Assyria; he settled in defiance of all his relatives.
Genesis	Ge	1	25	19	Now these are the records of the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham became the father of Isaac;
Genesis	Ge	1	25	20	and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean, to be his wife.
Genesis	Ge	1	25	21	Isaac prayed to the LORD on behalf of his wife, because she was barren; and the LORD answered him and Rebekah his wife conceived.
Genesis	Ge	1	25	22	But the children struggled together within her; and she said, "If it is so, why then am I this way?" So she went to inquire of the LORD.
Genesis	Ge	1	25	23	The LORD said to her, "Two nations are in your womb; And two peoples will be separated from your body; And one people shall be stronger than the other; And the older shall serve the younger."
Genesis	Ge	1	25	24	When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.
Genesis	Ge	1	25	25	Now the first came forth red, all over like a hairy garment; and they named him Esau.
Genesis	Ge	1	25	26	Afterward his brother came forth with his hand holding on to Esau's heel, so his name was called Jacob; and Isaac was sixty years old when she gave birth to them.
Genesis	Ge	1	25	27	When the boys grew up, Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the field, but Jacob was a peaceful man, living in tents.
Genesis	Ge	1	25	28	Now Isaac loved Esau, because he had a taste for game, but Rebekah loved Jacob.
Genesis	Ge	1	25	29	When Jacob had cooked stew, Esau came in from the field and he was famished;
Genesis	Ge	1	25	30	and Esau said to Jacob, "Please let me have a swallow of that red stuff there, for I am famished." Therefore his name was called Edom.
Genesis	Ge	1	25	31	But Jacob said, "First sell me your birthright."
Genesis	Ge	1	25	32	Esau said, "Behold, I am about to die; so of what use then is the birthright to me?"
Genesis	Ge	1	25	33	And Jacob said, "First swear to me"; so he swore to him, and sold his birthright to Jacob.
Genesis	Ge	1	25	34	Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew; and he ate and drank, and rose and went on his way. Thus Esau despised his birthright.
Genesis	Ge	1	26	1	Now there was a famine in the land, besides the previous famine that had occurred in the days of Abraham. So Isaac went to Gerar, to Abimelech king of the Philistines.
Genesis	Ge	1	26	2	The LORD appeared to him and said, "Do not go down to Egypt; stay in the land of which I shall tell you.
Genesis	Ge	1	26	3	"Sojourn in this land and I will be with you and bless you, for to you and to your descendants I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore to your father Abraham.
Genesis	Ge	1	26	4	"I will multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven, and will give your descendants all these lands; and by your descendants all the nations of the earth shall be blessed;
Genesis	Ge	1	26	5	because Abraham obeyed Me and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes and My laws."
Genesis	Ge	1	26	6	So Isaac lived in Gerar.
Genesis	Ge	1	26	7	When the men of the place asked about his wife, he said, "She is my sister," for he was afraid to say, "my wife," thinking, "the men of the place might kill me on account of Rebekah, for she is beautiful."
Genesis	Ge	1	26	8	It came about, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out through a window, and saw, and behold, Isaac was caressing his wife Rebekah.
Genesis	Ge	1	26	9	Then Abimelech called Isaac and said, "Behold, certainly she is your wife! How then did you say, 'She is my sister'?" And Isaac said to him, "Because I said, 'I might die on account of her.'"
Genesis	Ge	1	26	10	Abimelech said, "What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us."
Genesis	Ge	1	26	11	So Abimelech charged all the people, saying, "He who touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death."
Genesis	Ge	1	26	12	Now Isaac sowed in that land and reaped in the same year a hundredfold. And the LORD blessed him,
Genesis	Ge	1	26	13	and the man became rich, and continued to grow richer until he became very wealthy;
Genesis	Ge	1	26	14	for he had possessions of flocks and herds and a great household, so that the Philistines envied him.
Genesis	Ge	1	26	15	Now all the wells which his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines stopped up by filling them with earth.
Genesis	Ge	1	26	16	Then Abimelech said to Isaac, "Go away from us, for you are too powerful for us."
Genesis	Ge	1	26	17	And Isaac departed from there and camped in the valley of Gerar, and settled there.
Genesis	Ge	1	26	18	Then Isaac dug again the wells of water which had been dug in the days of his father Abraham, for the Philistines had stopped them up after the death of Abraham; and he gave them the same names which his father had given them.
Genesis	Ge	1	26	19	But when Isaac's servants dug in the valley and found there a well of flowing water,
Genesis	Ge	1	26	20	the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with the herdsmen of Isaac, saying, "The water is ours!" So he named the well Esek, because they contended with him.
Genesis	Ge	1	26	21	Then they dug another well, and they quarreled over it too, so he named it Sitnah.
Genesis	Ge	1	26	22	He moved away from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it; so he named it Rehoboth, for he said, "At last the LORD has made room for us, and we will be fruitful in the land."
Genesis	Ge	1	26	23	Then he went up from there to Beersheba.
Genesis	Ge	1	26	24	The LORD appeared to him the same night and said, "I am the God of your father Abraham; Do not fear, for I am with you. I will bless you, and multiply your descendants, For the sake of My servant Abraham."
Genesis	Ge	1	26	25	So he built an altar there and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there; and there Isaac's servants dug a well.
Genesis	Ge	1	26	26	Then Abimelech came to him from Gerar with his adviser Ahuzzath and Phicol the commander of his army.
Genesis	Ge	1	26	27	Isaac said to them, "Why have you come to me, since you hate me and have sent me away from you?"
Genesis	Ge	1	26	28	They said, "We see plainly that the LORD has been with you; so we said, 'Let there now be an oath between us, even between you and us, and let us make a covenant with you,
Genesis	Ge	1	26	29	that you will do us no harm, just as we have not touched you and have done to you nothing but good and have sent you away in peace. You are now the blessed of the LORD.'"
Genesis	Ge	1	26	30	Then he made them a feast, and they ate and drank.
Genesis	Ge	1	26	31	In the morning they arose early and exchanged oaths; then Isaac sent them away and they departed from him in peace.
Genesis	Ge	1	26	32	Now it came about on the same day, that Isaac's servants came in and told him about the well which they had dug, and said to him, "We have found water."
Genesis	Ge	1	26	33	So he called it Shibah; therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day.
Genesis	Ge	1	26	34	When Esau was forty years old he married Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite;
Genesis	Ge	1	26	35	and they brought grief to Isaac and Rebekah.
Genesis	Ge	1	27	1	Now it came about, when Isaac was old and his eyes were too dim to see, that he called his older son Esau and said to him, "My son." And he said to him, "Here I am."
Genesis	Ge	1	27	2	Isaac said, "Behold now, I am old and I do not know the day of my death.
Genesis	Ge	1	27	3	"Now then, please take your gear, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt game for me;
Genesis	Ge	1	27	4	and prepare a savory dish for me such as I love, and bring it to me that I may eat, so that my soul may bless you before I die."
Genesis	Ge	1	27	5	Rebekah was listening while Isaac spoke to his son Esau. So when Esau went to the field to hunt for game to bring home,
Genesis	Ge	1	27	6	Rebekah said to her son Jacob, "Behold, I heard your father speak to your brother Esau, saying,
Genesis	Ge	1	27	7	'Bring me some game and prepare a savory dish for me, that I may eat, and bless you in the presence of the LORD before my death.'
Genesis	Ge	1	27	8	"Now therefore, my son, listen to me as I command you.
Genesis	Ge	1	27	9	"Go now to the flock and bring me two choice young goats from there, that I may prepare them as a savory dish for your father, such as he loves.
Genesis	Ge	1	27	10	"Then you shall bring it to your father, that he may eat, so that he may bless you before his death."
Genesis	Ge	1	27	11	Jacob answered his mother Rebekah, "Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man and I am a smooth man.
Genesis	Ge	1	27	12	"Perhaps my father will feel me, then I will be as a deceiver in his sight, and I will bring upon myself a curse and not a blessing."
Genesis	Ge	1	27	13	But his mother said to him, "Your curse be on me, my son; only obey my voice, and go, get them for me."
Genesis	Ge	1	27	14	So he went and got them, and brought them to his mother; and his mother made savory food such as his father loved.
Genesis	Ge	1	27	15	Then Rebekah took the best garments of Esau her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son.
Genesis	Ge	1	27	16	And she put the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck.
Genesis	Ge	1	27	17	She also gave the savory food and the bread, which she had made, to her son Jacob.
Genesis	Ge	1	27	18	Then he came to his father and said, "My father." And he said, "Here I am. Who are you, my son?"
Genesis	Ge	1	27	19	Jacob said to his father, "I am Esau your firstborn; I have done as you told me. Get up, please, sit and eat of my game, that you may bless me."
Genesis	Ge	1	27	20	Isaac said to his son, "How is it that you have it so quickly, my son?" And he said, "Because the LORD your God caused it to happen to me."
Genesis	Ge	1	27	21	Then Isaac said to Jacob, "Please come close, that I may feel you, my son, whether you are really my son Esau or not."
Genesis	Ge	1	27	22	So Jacob came close to Isaac his father, and he felt him and said, "The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau."
Genesis	Ge	1	27	23	He did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau's hands; so he blessed him.
Genesis	Ge	1	27	24	And he said, "Are you really my son Esau?" And he said, "I am."
Genesis	Ge	1	27	25	So he said, "Bring it to me, and I will eat of my son's game, that I may bless you." And he brought it to him, and he ate; he also brought him wine and he drank.
Genesis	Ge	1	27	26	Then his father Isaac said to him, "Please come close and kiss me, my son."
Genesis	Ge	1	27	27	So he came close and kissed him; and when he smelled the smell of his garments, he blessed him and said, "See, the smell of my son Is like the smell of a field which the LORD has blessed;
Genesis	Ge	1	27	28	Now may God give you of the dew of heaven, And of the fatness of the earth, And an abundance of grain and new wine;
Genesis	Ge	1	27	29	May peoples serve you, And nations bow down to you; Be master of your brothers, And may your mother's sons bow down to you. Cursed be those who curse you, And blessed be those who bless you."
Genesis	Ge	1	27	30	Now it came about, as soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had hardly gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
Genesis	Ge	1	27	31	Then he also made savory food, and brought it to his father; and he said to his father, "Let my father arise and eat of his son's game, that you may bless me."
Genesis	Ge	1	27	32	Isaac his father said to him, "Who are you?" And he said, "I am your son, your firstborn, Esau."
Genesis	Ge	1	27	33	Then Isaac trembled violently, and said, "Who was he then that hunted game and brought it to me, so that I ate of all of it before you came, and blessed him? Yes, and he shall be blessed."
Genesis	Ge	1	27	34	When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, and said to his father, "Bless me, even me also, O my father!"
Genesis	Ge	1	27	35	And he said, "Your brother came deceitfully and has taken away your blessing."
Genesis	Ge	1	27	36	Then he said, "Is he not rightly named Jacob, for he has supplanted me these two times? He took away my birthright, and behold, now he has taken away my blessing." And he said, "Have you not reserved a blessing for me?"
Genesis	Ge	1	27	37	But Isaac replied to Esau, "Behold, I have made him your master, and all his relatives I have given to him as servants; and with grain and new wine I have sustained him. Now as for you then, what can I do, my son?"
Genesis	Ge	1	27	38	Esau said to his father, "Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father." So Esau lifted his voice and wept.
Genesis	Ge	1	27	39	Then Isaac his father answered and said to him, "Behold, away from the fertility of the earth shall be your dwelling, And away from the dew of heaven from above.
Genesis	Ge	1	27	40	"By your sword you shall live, And your brother you shall serve; But it shall come about when you become restless, That you will break his yoke from your neck."
Genesis	Ge	1	27	41	So Esau bore a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him; and Esau said to himself, "The days of mourning for my father are near; then I will kill my brother Jacob."
Genesis	Ge	1	27	42	Now when the words of her elder son Esau were reported to Rebekah, she sent and called her younger son Jacob, and said to him, "Behold your brother Esau is consoling himself concerning you by planning to kill you.
Genesis	Ge	1	27	43	"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice, and arise, flee to Haran, to my brother Laban!
Genesis	Ge	1	27	44	"Stay with him a few days, until your brother's fury subsides,
Genesis	Ge	1	27	45	until your brother's anger against you subsides and he forgets what you did to him. Then I will send and get you from there. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?"
Genesis	Ge	1	27	46	Rebekah said to Isaac, "I am tired of living because of the daughters of Heth; if Jacob takes a wife from the daughters of Heth, like these, from the daughters of the land, what good will my life be to me?"
Genesis	Ge	1	28	1	So Isaac called Jacob and blessed him and charged him, and said to him, "You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan.
Genesis	Ge	1	28	2	"Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother's father; and from there take to yourself a wife from the daughters of Laban your mother's brother.
Genesis	Ge	1	28	3	"May God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you, that you may become a company of peoples.
Genesis	Ge	1	28	4	"May He also give you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your descendants with you, that you may possess the land of your sojournings, which God gave to Abraham."
Genesis	Ge	1	28	5	Then Isaac sent Jacob away, and he went to Paddan-aram to Laban, son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.
Genesis	Ge	1	28	6	Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram to take to himself a wife from there, and that when he blessed him he charged him, saying, "You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan,"
Genesis	Ge	1	28	7	and that Jacob had obeyed his father and his mother and had gone to Paddan-aram.
Genesis	Ge	1	28	8	So Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan displeased his father Isaac;
Genesis	Ge	1	28	9	and Esau went to Ishmael, and married, besides the wives that he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth.
Genesis	Ge	1	28	10	Then Jacob departed from Beersheba and went toward Haran.
Genesis	Ge	1	28	11	He came to a certain place and spent the night there, because the sun had set; and he took one of the stones of the place and put it under his head, and lay down in that place.
Genesis	Ge	1	28	12	He had a dream, and behold, a ladder was set on the earth with its top reaching to heaven; and behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.
Genesis	Ge	1	28	13	And behold, the LORD stood above it and said, "I am the LORD, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac; the land on which you lie, I will give it to you and to your descendants.
Genesis	Ge	1	28	14	"Your descendants will also be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south; and in you and in your descendants shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
Genesis	Ge	1	28	15	"Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you."
Genesis	Ge	1	28	16	Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, "Surely the LORD is in this place, and I did not know it."
Genesis	Ge	1	28	17	He was afraid and said, "How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven."
Genesis	Ge	1	28	18	So Jacob rose early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up as a pillar and poured oil on its top.
Genesis	Ge	1	28	19	He called the name of that place Bethel; however, previously the name of the city had been Luz.
Genesis	Ge	1	28	20	Then Jacob made a vow, saying, "If God will be with me and will keep me on this journey that I take, and will give me food to eat and garments to wear,
Genesis	Ge	1	28	21	and I return to my father's house in safety, then the LORD will be my God.
Genesis	Ge	1	28	22	"This stone, which I have set up as a pillar, will be God's house, and of all that You give me I will surely give a tenth to You."
Genesis	Ge	1	29	1	Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the sons of the east.
Genesis	Ge	1	29	2	He looked, and saw a well in the field, and behold, three flocks of sheep were lying there beside it, for from that well they watered the flocks. Now the stone on the mouth of the well was large.
Genesis	Ge	1	29	3	When all the flocks were gathered there, they would then roll the stone from the mouth of the well and water the sheep, and put the stone back in its place on the mouth of the well.
Genesis	Ge	1	29	4	Jacob said to them, "My brothers, where are you from?" And they said, "We are from Haran."
Genesis	Ge	1	29	5	He said to them, "Do you know Laban the son of Nahor?" And they said, "We know him."
Genesis	Ge	1	29	6	And he said to them, "Is it well with him?" And they said, "It is well, and here is Rachel his daughter coming with the sheep."
Genesis	Ge	1	29	7	He said, "Behold, it is still high day; it is not time for the livestock to be gathered. Water the sheep, and go, pasture them."
Genesis	Ge	1	29	8	But they said, "We cannot, until all the flocks are gathered, and they roll the stone from the mouth of the well; then we water the sheep."
Genesis	Ge	1	29	9	While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she was a shepherdess.
Genesis	Ge	1	29	10	When Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, Jacob went up and rolled the stone from the mouth of the well and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.
Genesis	Ge	1	29	11	Then Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted his voice and wept.
Genesis	Ge	1	29	12	Jacob told Rachel that he was a relative of her father and that he was Rebekah's son, and she ran and told her father.
Genesis	Ge	1	29	13	So when Laban heard the news of Jacob his sister's son, he ran to meet him, and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house. Then he related to Laban all these things.
Genesis	Ge	1	29	14	Laban said to him, "Surely you are my bone and my flesh." And he stayed with him a month.
Genesis	Ge	1	29	15	Then Laban said to Jacob, "Because you are my relative, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?"
Genesis	Ge	1	29	16	Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
Genesis	Ge	1	29	17	And Leah's eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful of form and face.
Genesis	Ge	1	29	18	Now Jacob loved Rachel, so he said, "I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel."
Genesis	Ge	1	29	19	Laban said, "It is better that I give her to you than to give her to another man; stay with me."
Genesis	Ge	1	29	20	So Jacob served seven years for Rachel and they seemed to him but a few days because of his love for her.
Genesis	Ge	1	29	21	Then Jacob said to Laban, "Give me my wife, for my time is completed, that I may go in to her."
Genesis	Ge	1	29	22	Laban gathered all the men of the place and made a feast.
Genesis	Ge	1	29	23	Now in the evening he took his daughter Leah, and brought her to him; and Jacob went in to her.
Genesis	Ge	1	29	24	Laban also gave his maid Zilpah to his daughter Leah as a maid.
Genesis	Ge	1	29	25	So it came about in the morning that, behold, it was Leah! And he said to Laban, "What is this you have done to me? Was it not for Rachel that I served with you? Why then have you deceived me?"
Genesis	Ge	1	29	26	But Laban said, "It is not the practice in our place to marry off the younger before the firstborn.
Genesis	Ge	1	29	27	"Complete the week of this one, and we will give you the other also for the service which you shall serve with me for another seven years."
Genesis	Ge	1	29	28	Jacob did so and completed her week, and he gave him his daughter Rachel as his wife.
Genesis	Ge	1	29	29	Laban also gave his maid Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her maid.
Genesis	Ge	1	29	30	So Jacob went in to Rachel also, and indeed he loved Rachel more than Leah, and he served with Laban for another seven years.
Genesis	Ge	1	29	31	Now the LORD saw that Leah was unloved, and He opened her womb, but Rachel was barren.
Genesis	Ge	1	29	32	Leah conceived and bore a son and named him Reuben, for she said, "Because the LORD has seen my affliction; surely now my husband will love me."
Genesis	Ge	1	29	33	Then she conceived again and bore a son and said, "Because the LORD has heard that I am unloved, He has therefore given me this son also." So she named him Simeon.
Genesis	Ge	1	29	34	She conceived again and bore a son and said, "Now this time my husband will become attached to me, because I have borne him three sons." Therefore he was named Levi.
Genesis	Ge	1	29	35	And she conceived again and bore a son and said, "This time I will praise the LORD." Therefore she named him Judah. Then she stopped bearing.
Genesis	Ge	1	30	1	Now when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, she became jealous of her sister; and she said to Jacob, "Give me children, or else I die."
Genesis	Ge	1	30	2	Then Jacob's anger burned against Rachel, and he said, "Am I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?"
Genesis	Ge	1	30	3	She said, "Here is my maid Bilhah, go in to her that she may bear on my knees, that through her I too may have children."
Genesis	Ge	1	30	4	So she gave him her maid Bilhah as a wife, and Jacob went in to her.
Genesis	Ge	1	30	5	Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son.
Genesis	Ge	1	30	6	Then Rachel said, "God has vindicated me, and has indeed heard my voice and has given me a son." Therefore she named him Dan.
Genesis	Ge	1	30	7	Rachel's maid Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.
Genesis	Ge	1	30	8	So Rachel said, "With mighty wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister, and I have indeed prevailed." And she named him Naphtali.
Genesis	Ge	1	30	9	When Leah saw that she had stopped bearing, she took her maid Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife.
Genesis	Ge	1	30	10	Leah's maid Zilpah bore Jacob a son.
Genesis	Ge	1	30	11	Then Leah said, "How fortunate!" So she named him Gad.
Genesis	Ge	1	30	12	Leah's maid Zilpah bore Jacob a second son.
Genesis	Ge	1	30	13	Then Leah said, "Happy am I! For women will call me happy." So she named him Asher.
Genesis	Ge	1	30	14	Now in the days of wheat harvest Reuben went and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, "Please give me some of your son's mandrakes."
Genesis	Ge	1	30	15	But she said to her, "Is it a small matter for you to take my husband? And would you take my son's mandrakes also?" So Rachel said, "Therefore he may lie with you tonight in return for your son's mandrakes."
Genesis	Ge	1	30	16	When Jacob came in from the field in the evening, then Leah went out to meet him and said, "You must come in to me, for I have surely hired you with my son's mandrakes." So he lay with her that night.
Genesis	Ge	1	30	17	God gave heed to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son.
Genesis	Ge	1	30	18	Then Leah said, "God has given me my wages because I gave my maid to my husband." So she named him Issachar.
Genesis	Ge	1	30	19	Leah conceived again and bore a sixth son to Jacob.
Genesis	Ge	1	30	20	Then Leah said, "God has endowed me with a good gift; now my husband will dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons." So she named him Zebulun.
Genesis	Ge	1	30	21	Afterward she bore a daughter and named her Dinah.
Genesis	Ge	1	30	22	Then God remembered Rachel, and God gave heed to her and opened her womb.
Genesis	Ge	1	30	23	So she conceived and bore a son and said, "God has taken away my reproach."
Genesis	Ge	1	30	24	She named him Joseph, saying, "May the LORD give me another son."
Genesis	Ge	1	30	25	Now it came about when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, "Send me away, that I may go to my own place and to my own country.
Genesis	Ge	1	30	26	"Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me depart; for you yourself know my service which I have rendered you."
Genesis	Ge	1	30	27	But Laban said to him, "If now it pleases you, stay with me; I have divined that the LORD has blessed me on your account."
Genesis	Ge	1	30	28	He continued, "Name me your wages, and I will give it."
Genesis	Ge	1	30	29	But he said to him, "You yourself know how I have served you and how your cattle have fared with me.
Genesis	Ge	1	30	30	"For you had little before I came and it has increased to a multitude, and the LORD has blessed you wherever I turned. But now, when shall I provide for my own household also?"
Genesis	Ge	1	30	31	So he said, "What shall I give you?" And Jacob said, "You shall not give me anything. If you will do this one thing for me, I will again pasture and keep your flock:
Genesis	Ge	1	30	32	let me pass through your entire flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted sheep and every black one among the lambs and the spotted and speckled among the goats; and such shall be my wages.
Genesis	Ge	1	30	33	"So my honesty will answer for me later, when you come concerning my wages. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and black among the lambs, if found with me, will be considered stolen."
Genesis	Ge	1	30	34	Laban said, "Good, let it be according to your word."
Genesis	Ge	1	30	35	So he removed on that day the striped and spotted male goats and all the speckled and spotted female goats, every one with white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the care of his sons.
Genesis	Ge	1	30	36	And he put a distance of three days' journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.
Genesis	Ge	1	30	37	Then Jacob took fresh rods of poplar and almond and plane trees, and peeled white stripes in them, exposing the white which was in the rods.
Genesis	Ge	1	30	38	He set the rods which he had peeled in front of the flocks in the gutters, even in the watering troughs, where the flocks came to drink; and they mated when they came to drink.
Genesis	Ge	1	30	39	So the flocks mated by the rods, and the flocks brought forth striped, speckled, and spotted.
Genesis	Ge	1	30	40	Jacob separated the lambs, and made the flocks face toward the striped and all the black in the flock of Laban; and he put his own herds apart, and did not put them with Laban's flock.
Genesis	Ge	1	30	41	Moreover, whenever the stronger of the flock were mating, Jacob would place the rods in the sight of the flock in the gutters, so that they might mate by the rods;
Genesis	Ge	1	30	42	but when the flock was feeble, he did not put them in; so the feebler were Laban's and the stronger Jacob's.
Genesis	Ge	1	30	43	So the man became exceedingly prosperous, and had large flocks and female and male servants and camels and donkeys.
Genesis	Ge	1	31	1	Now Jacob heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, "Jacob has taken away all that was our father's, and from what belonged to our father he has made all this wealth."
Genesis	Ge	1	31	2	Jacob saw the attitude of Laban, and behold, it was not friendly toward him as formerly.
Genesis	Ge	1	31	3	Then the LORD said to Jacob, "Return to the land of your fathers and to your relatives, and I will be with you."
Genesis	Ge	1	31	4	So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to his flock in the field,
Genesis	Ge	1	31	5	and said to them, "I see your father's attitude, that it is not friendly toward me as formerly, but the God of my father has been with me.
Genesis	Ge	1	31	6	"You know that I have served your father with all my strength.
Genesis	Ge	1	31	7	"Yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times; however, God did not allow him to hurt me.
Genesis	Ge	1	31	8	"If he spoke thus, 'The speckled shall be your wages,' then all the flock brought forth speckled; and if he spoke thus, 'The striped shall be your wages,' then all the flock brought forth striped.
Genesis	Ge	1	31	9	"Thus God has taken away your father's livestock and given them to me.
Genesis	Ge	1	31	10	"And it came about at the time when the flock were mating that I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream, and behold, the male goats which were mating were striped, speckled, and mottled.
Genesis	Ge	1	31	11	"Then the angel of God said to me in the dream, 'Jacob,' and I said, 'Here I am.'
Genesis	Ge	1	31	12	"He said, 'Lift up now your eyes and see that all the male goats which are mating are striped, speckled, and mottled; for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you.
Genesis	Ge	1	31	13	'I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you made a vow to Me; now arise, leave this land, and return to the land of your birth.'"
Genesis	Ge	1	31	14	Rachel and Leah said to him, "Do we still have any portion or inheritance in our father's house?
Genesis	Ge	1	31	15	"Are we not reckoned by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and has also entirely consumed our purchase price.
Genesis	Ge	1	31	16	"Surely all the wealth which God has taken away from our father belongs to us and our children; now then, do whatever God has said to you."
Genesis	Ge	1	31	17	Then Jacob arose and put his children and his wives upon camels;
Genesis	Ge	1	31	18	and he drove away all his livestock and all his property which he had gathered, his acquired livestock which he had gathered in Paddan-aram, to go to the land of Canaan to his father Isaac.
Genesis	Ge	1	31	19	When Laban had gone to shear his flock, then Rachel stole the household idols that were her father's.
Genesis	Ge	1	31	20	And Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him that he was fleeing.
Genesis	Ge	1	31	21	So he fled with all that he had; and he arose and crossed the Euphrates River, and set his face toward the hill country of Gilead.
Genesis	Ge	1	31	22	When it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled,
Genesis	Ge	1	31	23	then he took his kinsmen with him and pursued him a distance of seven days' journey, and he overtook him in the hill country of Gilead.
Genesis	Ge	1	31	24	God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream of the night and said to him, "Be careful that you do not speak to Jacob either good or bad."
Genesis	Ge	1	31	25	Laban caught up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban with his kinsmen camped in the hill country of Gilead.
Genesis	Ge	1	31	26	Then Laban said to Jacob, "What have you done by deceiving me and carrying away my daughters like captives of the sword?
Genesis	Ge	1	31	27	"Why did you flee secretly and deceive me, and did not tell me so that I might have sent you away with joy and with songs, with timbrel and with lyre;
Genesis	Ge	1	31	28	and did not allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now you have done foolishly.
Genesis	Ge	1	31	29	"It is in my power to do you harm, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, 'Be careful not to speak either good or bad to Jacob.'
Genesis	Ge	1	31	30	"Now you have indeed gone away because you longed greatly for your father's house; but why did you steal my gods?"
Genesis	Ge	1	31	31	Then Jacob replied to Laban, "Because I was afraid, for I thought that you would take your daughters from me by force.
Genesis	Ge	1	31	32	"The one with whom you find your gods shall not live; in the presence of our kinsmen point out what is yours among my belongings and take it for yourself." For Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.
Genesis	Ge	1	31	33	So Laban went into Jacob's tent and into Leah's tent and into the tent of the two maids, but he did not find them. Then he went out of Leah's tent and entered Rachel's tent.
Genesis	Ge	1	31	34	Now Rachel had taken the household idols and put them in the camel's saddle, and she sat on them. And Laban felt through all the tent but did not find them.
Genesis	Ge	1	31	35	She said to her father, "Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise before you, for the manner of women is upon me." So he searched but did not find the household idols.
Genesis	Ge	1	31	36	Then Jacob became angry and contended with Laban; and Jacob said to Laban, "What is my transgression? What is my sin that you have hotly pursued me?
Genesis	Ge	1	31	37	"Though you have felt through all my goods, what have you found of all your household goods? Set it here before my kinsmen and your kinsmen, that they may decide between us two.
Genesis	Ge	1	31	38	"These twenty years I have been with you; your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten the rams of your flocks.
Genesis	Ge	1	31	39	"That which was torn of beasts I did not bring to you; I bore the loss of it myself. You required it of my hand whether stolen by day or stolen by night.
Genesis	Ge	1	31	40	"Thus I was: by day the heat consumed me and the frost by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes.
Genesis	Ge	1	31	41	"These twenty years I have been in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flock, and you changed my wages ten times.
Genesis	Ge	1	31	42	"If the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had not been for me, surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed. God has seen my affliction and the toil of my hands, so He rendered judgment last night."
Genesis	Ge	1	31	43	Then Laban replied to Jacob, "The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine. But what can I do this day to these my daughters or to their children whom they have borne?
Genesis	Ge	1	31	44	"So now come, let us make a covenant, you and I, and let it be a witness between you and me."
Genesis	Ge	1	31	45	Then Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.
Genesis	Ge	1	31	46	Jacob said to his kinsmen, "Gather stones." So they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there by the heap.
Genesis	Ge	1	31	47	Now Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.
Genesis	Ge	1	31	48	Laban said, "This heap is a witness between you and me this day." Therefore it was named Galeed,
Genesis	Ge	1	31	49	and Mizpah, for he said, "May the LORD watch between you and me when we are absent one from the other.
Genesis	Ge	1	31	50	"If you mistreat my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, although no man is with us, see, God is witness between you and me."
Genesis	Ge	1	31	51	Laban said to Jacob, "Behold this heap and behold the pillar which I have set between you and me.
Genesis	Ge	1	31	52	"This heap is a witness, and the pillar is a witness, that I will not pass by this heap to you for harm, and you will not pass by this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.
Genesis	Ge	1	31	53	"The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us." So Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac.
Genesis	Ge	1	31	54	Then Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain, and called his kinsmen to the meal; and they ate the meal and spent the night on the mountain.
Genesis	Ge	1	31	55	Early in the morning Laban arose, and kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them. Then Laban departed and returned to his place.
Genesis	Ge	1	32	1	Now as Jacob went on his way, the angels of God met him.
Genesis	Ge	1	32	2	Jacob said when he saw them, "This is God's camp." So he named that place Mahanaim.
Genesis	Ge	1	32	3	Then Jacob sent messengers before him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom.
Genesis	Ge	1	32	4	He also commanded them saying, "Thus you shall say to my lord Esau: 'Thus says your servant Jacob, "I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now;
Genesis	Ge	1	32	5	I have oxen and donkeys and flocks and male and female servants; and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in your sight."'"
Genesis	Ge	1	32	6	The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, "We came to your brother Esau, and furthermore he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him."
Genesis	Ge	1	32	7	Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed; and he divided the people who were with him, and the flocks and the herds and the camels, into two companies;
Genesis	Ge	1	32	8	for he said, "If Esau comes to the one company and attacks it, then the company which is left will escape."
Genesis	Ge	1	32	9	Jacob said, "O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O LORD, who said to me, 'Return to your country and to your relatives, and I will prosper you,'
Genesis	Ge	1	32	10	I am unworthy of all the lovingkindness and of all the faithfulness which You have shown to Your servant; for with my staff only I crossed this Jordan, and now I have become two companies.
Genesis	Ge	1	32	11	"Deliver me, I pray, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, that he will come and attack me and the mothers with the children.
Genesis	Ge	1	32	12	"For You said, 'I will surely prosper you and make your descendants as the sand of the sea, which is too great to be numbered.'"
Genesis	Ge	1	32	13	So he spent the night there. Then he selected from what he had with him a present for his brother Esau:
Genesis	Ge	1	32	14	two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
Genesis	Ge	1	32	15	thirty milking camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.
Genesis	Ge	1	32	16	He delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, "Pass on before me, and put a space between droves."
Genesis	Ge	1	32	17	He commanded the one in front, saying, "When my brother Esau meets you and asks you, saying, 'To whom do you belong, and where are you going, and to whom do these animals in front of you belong?'
Genesis	Ge	1	32	18	then you shall say, 'These belong to your servant Jacob; it is a present sent to my lord Esau. And behold, he also is behind us.'"
Genesis	Ge	1	32	19	Then he commanded also the second and the third, and all those who followed the droves, saying, "After this manner you shall speak to Esau when you find him;
Genesis	Ge	1	32	20	and you shall say, 'Behold, your servant Jacob also is behind us.'" For he said, "I will appease him with the present that goes before me. Then afterward I will see his face; perhaps he will accept me."
Genesis	Ge	1	32	21	So the present passed on before him, while he himself spent that night in the camp.
Genesis	Ge	1	32	22	Now he arose that same night and took his two wives and his two maids and his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.
Genesis	Ge	1	32	23	He took them and sent them across the stream. And he sent across whatever he had.
Genesis	Ge	1	32	24	Then Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until daybreak.
Genesis	Ge	1	32	25	When he saw that he had not prevailed against him, he touched the socket of his thigh; so the socket of Jacob's thigh was dislocated while he wrestled with him.
Genesis	Ge	1	32	26	Then he said, "Let me go, for the dawn is breaking." But he said, "I will not let you go unless you bless me."
Genesis	Ge	1	32	27	So he said to him, "What is your name?" And he said, "Jacob."
Genesis	Ge	1	32	28	He said, "Your name shall no longer be Jacob, but Israel; for you have striven with God and with men and have prevailed."
Genesis	Ge	1	32	29	Then Jacob asked him and said, "Please tell me your name." But he said, "Why is it that you ask my name?" And he blessed him there.
Genesis	Ge	1	32	30	So Jacob named the place Peniel, for he said, "I have seen God face to face, yet my life has been preserved."
Genesis	Ge	1	32	31	Now the sun rose upon him just as he crossed over Penuel, and he was limping on his thigh.
Genesis	Ge	1	32	32	Therefore, to this day the sons of Israel do not eat the sinew of the hip which is on the socket of the thigh, because he touched the socket of Jacob's thigh in the sinew of the hip.
Genesis	Ge	1	33	1	Then Jacob lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, Esau was coming, and four hundred men with him. So he divided the children among Leah and Rachel and the two maids.
Genesis	Ge	1	33	2	He put the maids and their children in front, and Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph last.
Genesis	Ge	1	33	3	But he himself passed on ahead of them and bowed down to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.
Genesis	Ge	1	33	4	Then Esau ran to meet him and embraced him, and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept.
Genesis	Ge	1	33	5	He lifted his eyes and saw the women and the children, and said, "Who are these with you?" So he said, "The children whom God has graciously given your servant."
Genesis	Ge	1	33	6	Then the maids came near with their children, and they bowed down.
Genesis	Ge	1	33	7	Leah likewise came near with her children, and they bowed down; and afterward Joseph came near with Rachel, and they bowed down.
Genesis	Ge	1	33	8	And he said, "What do you mean by all this company which I have met?" And he said, "To find favor in the sight of my lord."
Genesis	Ge	1	33	9	But Esau said, "I have plenty, my brother; let what you have be your own."
Genesis	Ge	1	33	10	Jacob said, "No, please, if now I have found favor in your sight, then take my present from my hand, for I see your face as one sees the face of God, and you have received me favorably.
Genesis	Ge	1	33	11	"Please take my gift which has been brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me and because I have plenty." Thus he urged him and he took it.
Genesis	Ge	1	33	12	Then Esau said, "Let us take our journey and go, and I will go before you."
Genesis	Ge	1	33	13	But he said to him, "My lord knows that the children are frail and that the flocks and herds which are nursing are a care to me. And if they are driven hard one day, all the flocks will die.
Genesis	Ge	1	33	14	"Please let my lord pass on before his servant, and I will proceed at my leisure, according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord at Seir."
Genesis	Ge	1	33	15	Esau said, "Please let me leave with you some of the people who are with me." But he said, "What need is there? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord."
Genesis	Ge	1	33	16	So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.
Genesis	Ge	1	33	17	Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built for himself a house and made booths for his livestock; therefore the place is named Succoth.
Genesis	Ge	1	33	18	Now Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram, and camped before the city.
Genesis	Ge	1	33	19	He bought the piece of land where he had pitched his tent from the hand of the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father, for one hundred pieces of money.
Genesis	Ge	1	33	20	Then he erected there an altar and called it El-Elohe-Israel.
Genesis	Ge	1	34	1	Now Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the daughters of the land.
Genesis	Ge	1	34	2	When Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her, he took her and lay with her by force.
Genesis	Ge	1	34	3	He was deeply attracted to Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the girl and spoke tenderly to her.
Genesis	Ge	1	34	4	So Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, "Get me this young girl for a wife."
Genesis	Ge	1	34	5	Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter; but his sons were with his livestock in the field, so Jacob kept silent until they came in.
Genesis	Ge	1	34	6	Then Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him.
Genesis	Ge	1	34	7	Now the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it; and the men were grieved, and they were very angry because he had done a disgraceful thing in Israel by lying with Jacob's daughter, for such a thing ought not to be done.
Genesis	Ge	1	34	8	But Hamor spoke with them, saying, "The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter; please give her to him in marriage.
Genesis	Ge	1	34	9	"Intermarry with us; give your daughters to us and take our daughters for yourselves.
Genesis	Ge	1	34	10	"Thus you shall live with us, and the land shall be open before you; live and trade in it and acquire property in it."
Genesis	Ge	1	34	11	Shechem also said to her father and to her brothers, "If I find favor in your sight, then I will give whatever you say to me.
Genesis	Ge	1	34	12	"Ask me ever so much bridal payment and gift, and I will give according as you say to me; but give me the girl in marriage."
Genesis	Ge	1	34	13	But Jacob's sons answered Shechem and his father Hamor with deceit, because he had defiled Dinah their sister.
Genesis	Ge	1	34	14	They said to them, "We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised, for that would be a disgrace to us.
Genesis	Ge	1	34	15	"Only on this condition will we consent to you: if you will become like us, in that every male of you be circumcised,
Genesis	Ge	1	34	16	then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters for ourselves, and we will live with you and become one people.
Genesis	Ge	1	34	17	"But if you will not listen to us to be circumcised, then we will take our daughter and go."
Genesis	Ge	1	34	18	Now their words seemed reasonable to Hamor and Shechem, Hamor's son.
Genesis	Ge	1	34	19	The young man did not delay to do the thing, because he was delighted with Jacob's daughter. Now he was more respected than all the household of his father.
Genesis	Ge	1	34	20	So Hamor and his son Shechem came to the gate of their city and spoke to the men of their city, saying,
Genesis	Ge	1	34	21	"These men are friendly with us; therefore let them live in the land and trade in it, for behold, the land is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters in marriage, and give our daughters to them.
Genesis	Ge	1	34	22	"Only on this condition will the men consent to us to live with us, to become one people: that every male among us be circumcised as they are circumcised.
Genesis	Ge	1	34	23	"Will not their livestock and their property and all their animals be ours? Only let us consent to them, and they will live with us."
Genesis	Ge	1	34	24	All who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor and to his son Shechem, and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.
Genesis	Ge	1	34	25	Now it came about on the third day, when they were in pain, that two of Jacob's sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, each took his sword and came upon the city unawares, and killed every male.
Genesis	Ge	1	34	26	They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah from Shechem's house, and went forth.
Genesis	Ge	1	34	27	Jacob's sons came upon the slain and looted the city, because they had defiled their sister.
Genesis	Ge	1	34	28	They took their flocks and their herds and their donkeys, and that which was in the city and that which was in the field;
Genesis	Ge	1	34	29	and they captured and looted all their wealth and all their little ones and their wives, even all that was in the houses.
Genesis	Ge	1	34	30	Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, "You have brought trouble on me by making me odious among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites; and my men being few in number, they will gather together against me and attack me and I will be destroyed, I and my household."
Genesis	Ge	1	34	31	But they said, "Should he treat our sister as a harlot?"
Genesis	Ge	1	35	1	Then God said to Jacob, "Arise, go up to Bethel and live there, and make an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau."
Genesis	Ge	1	35	2	So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, "Put away the foreign gods which are among you, and purify yourselves and change your garments;
Genesis	Ge	1	35	3	and let us arise and go up to Bethel, and I will make an altar there to God, who answered me in the day of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone."
Genesis	Ge	1	35	4	So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which they had and the rings which were in their ears, and Jacob hid them under the oak which was near Shechem.
Genesis	Ge	1	35	5	As they journeyed, there was a great terror upon the cities which were around them, and they did not pursue the sons of Jacob.
Genesis	Ge	1	35	6	So Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him.
Genesis	Ge	1	35	7	He built an altar there, and called the place El-bethel, because there God had revealed Himself to him when he fled from his brother.
Genesis	Ge	1	35	8	Now Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel under the oak; it was named Allon-bacuth.
Genesis	Ge	1	35	9	Then God appeared to Jacob again when he came from Paddan-aram, and He blessed him.
Genesis	Ge	1	35	10	God said to him, "Your name is Jacob; You shall no longer be called Jacob, But Israel shall be your name." Thus He called him Israel.
Genesis	Ge	1	35	11	God also said to him, "I am God Almighty; Be fruitful and multiply; A nation and a company of nations shall come from you, And kings shall come forth from you.
Genesis	Ge	1	35	12	"The land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give it to you, And I will give the land to your descendants after you."
Genesis	Ge	1	35	13	Then God went up from him in the place where He had spoken with him.
Genesis	Ge	1	35	14	Jacob set up a pillar in the place where He had spoken with him, a pillar of stone, and he poured out a drink offering on it; he also poured oil on it.
Genesis	Ge	1	35	15	So Jacob named the place where God had spoken with him, Bethel.
Genesis	Ge	1	35	16	Then they journeyed from Bethel; and when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth and she suffered severe labor.
Genesis	Ge	1	35	17	When she was in severe labor the midwife said to her, "Do not fear, for now you have another son."
Genesis	Ge	1	35	18	It came about as her soul was departing (for she died), that she named him Ben-oni; but his father called him Benjamin.
Genesis	Ge	1	35	19	So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).
Genesis	Ge	1	35	20	Jacob set up a pillar over her grave; that is the pillar of Rachel's grave to this day.
Genesis	Ge	1	35	21	Then Israel journeyed on and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder.
Genesis	Ge	1	35	22	It came about while Israel was dwelling in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine, and Israel heard of it. Now there were twelve sons of Jacob--
Genesis	Ge	1	35	23	the sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, then Simeon and Levi and Judah and Issachar and Zebulun;
Genesis	Ge	1	35	24	the sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin;
Genesis	Ge	1	35	25	and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's maid: Dan and Naphtali;
Genesis	Ge	1	35	26	and the sons of Zilpah, Leah's maid: Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan-aram.
Genesis	Ge	1	35	27	Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre of Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had sojourned.
Genesis	Ge	1	35	28	Now the days of Isaac were one hundred and eighty years.
Genesis	Ge	1	35	29	Isaac breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people, an old man of ripe age; and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
Genesis	Ge	1	36	1	Now these are the records of the generations of Esau (that is, Edom).
Genesis	Ge	1	36	2	Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah and the granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite;
Genesis	Ge	1	36	3	also Basemath, Ishmael's daughter, the sister of Nebaioth.
Genesis	Ge	1	36	4	Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, and Basemath bore Reuel,
Genesis	Ge	1	36	5	and Oholibamah bore Jeush and Jalam and Korah. These are the sons of Esau who were born to him in the land of Canaan.
Genesis	Ge	1	36	6	Then Esau took his wives and his sons and his daughters and all his household, and his livestock and all his cattle and all his goods which he had acquired in the land of Canaan, and went to another land away from his brother Jacob.
Genesis	Ge	1	36	7	For their property had become too great for them to live together, and the land where they sojourned could not sustain them because of their livestock.
Genesis	Ge	1	36	8	So Esau lived in the hill country of Seir; Esau is Edom.
Genesis	Ge	1	36	9	These then are the records of the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in the hill country of Seir.
Genesis	Ge	1	36	10	These are the names of Esau's sons: Eliphaz the son of Esau's wife Adah, Reuel the son of Esau's wife Basemath.
Genesis	Ge	1	36	11	The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho and Gatam and Kenaz.
Genesis	Ge	1	36	12	Timna was a concubine of Esau's son Eliphaz and she bore Amalek to Eliphaz. These are the sons of Esau's wife Adah.
Genesis	Ge	1	36	13	These are the sons of Reuel: Nahath and Zerah, Shammah and Mizzah. These were the sons of Esau's wife Basemath.
Genesis	Ge	1	36	14	These were the sons of Esau's wife Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah and the granddaughter of Zibeon: she bore to Esau, Jeush and Jalam and Korah.
Genesis	Ge	1	36	15	These are the chiefs of the sons of Esau. The sons of Eliphaz, the firstborn of Esau, are chief Teman, chief Omar, chief Zepho, chief Kenaz,
Genesis	Ge	1	36	16	chief Korah, chief Gatam, chief Amalek. These are the chiefs descended from Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Adah.
Genesis	Ge	1	36	17	These are the sons of Reuel, Esau's son: chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief Shammah, chief Mizzah. These are the chiefs descended from Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Esau's wife Basemath.
Genesis	Ge	1	36	18	These are the sons of Esau's wife Oholibamah: chief Jeush, chief Jalam, chief Korah. These are the chiefs descended from Esau's wife Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah.
Genesis	Ge	1	36	19	These are the sons of Esau (that is, Edom), and these are their chiefs.
Genesis	Ge	1	36	20	These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan and Shobal and Zibeon and Anah,
Genesis	Ge	1	36	21	and Dishon and Ezer and Dishan. These are the chiefs descended from the Horites, the sons of Seir in the land of Edom.
Genesis	Ge	1	36	22	The sons of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's sister was Timna.
Genesis	Ge	1	36	23	These are the sons of Shobal: Alvan and Manahath and Ebal, Shepho and Onam.
Genesis	Ge	1	36	24	These are the sons of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah--he is the Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness when he was pasturing the donkeys of his father Zibeon.
Genesis	Ge	1	36	25	These are the children of Anah: Dishon, and Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah.
Genesis	Ge	1	36	26	These are the sons of Dishon: Hemdan and Eshban and Ithran and Cheran.
Genesis	Ge	1	36	27	These are the sons of Ezer: Bilhan and Zaavan and Akan.
Genesis	Ge	1	36	28	These are the sons of Dishan: Uz and Aran.
Genesis	Ge	1	36	29	These are the chiefs descended from the Horites: chief Lotan, chief Shobal, chief Zibeon, chief Anah,
Genesis	Ge	1	36	30	chief Dishon, chief Ezer, chief Dishan. These are the chiefs descended from the Horites, according to their various chiefs in the land of Seir.
Genesis	Ge	1	36	31	Now these are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before any king reigned over the sons of Israel.
Genesis	Ge	1	36	32	Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom, and the name of his city was Dinhabah.
Genesis	Ge	1	36	33	Then Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah became king in his place.
Genesis	Ge	1	36	34	Then Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites became king in his place.
Genesis	Ge	1	36	35	Then Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who defeated Midian in the field of Moab, became king in his place; and the name of his city was Avith.
Genesis	Ge	1	36	36	Then Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah became king in his place.
Genesis	Ge	1	36	37	Then Samlah died, and Shaul of Rehoboth on the Euphrates River became king in his place.
Genesis	Ge	1	36	38	Then Shaul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor became king in his place.
Genesis	Ge	1	36	39	Then Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar became king in his place; and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, daughter of Mezahab.
Genesis	Ge	1	36	40	Now these are the names of the chiefs descended from Esau, according to their families and their localities, by their names: chief Timna, chief Alvah, chief Jetheth,
Genesis	Ge	1	36	41	chief Oholibamah, chief Elah, chief Pinon,
Genesis	Ge	1	36	42	chief Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar,
Genesis	Ge	1	36	43	chief Magdiel, chief Iram. These are the chiefs of Edom (that is, Esau, the father of the Edomites), according to their habitations in the land of their possession.
Genesis	Ge	1	37	1	Now Jacob lived in the land where his father had sojourned, in the land of Canaan.
Genesis	Ge	1	37	2	These are the records of the generations of Jacob. Joseph, when seventeen years of age, was pasturing the flock with his brothers while he was still a youth, along with the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives. And Joseph brought back a bad report about them to their father.
Genesis	Ge	1	37	3	Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons, because he was the son of his old age; and he made him a varicolored tunic.
Genesis	Ge	1	37	4	His brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers; and so they hated him and could not speak to him on friendly terms.
Genesis	Ge	1	37	5	Then Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him even more.
Genesis	Ge	1	37	6	He said to them, "Please listen to this dream which I have had;
Genesis	Ge	1	37	7	for behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and lo, my sheaf rose up and also stood erect; and behold, your sheaves gathered around and bowed down to my sheaf."
Genesis	Ge	1	37	8	Then his brothers said to him, "Are you actually going to reign over us? Or are you really going to rule over us?" So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words.
Genesis	Ge	1	37	9	Now he had still another dream, and related it to his brothers, and said, "Lo, I have had still another dream; and behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me."
Genesis	Ge	1	37	10	He related it to his father and to his brothers; and his father rebuked him and said to him, "What is this dream that you have had? Shall I and your mother and your brothers actually come to bow ourselves down before you to the ground?"
Genesis	Ge	1	37	11	His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the saying in mind.
Genesis	Ge	1	37	12	Then his brothers went to pasture their father's flock in Shechem.
Genesis	Ge	1	37	13	Israel said to Joseph, "Are not your brothers pasturing the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send you to them." And he said to him, "I will go."
Genesis	Ge	1	37	14	Then he said to him, "Go now and see about the welfare of your brothers and the welfare of the flock, and bring word back to me." So he sent him from the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
Genesis	Ge	1	37	15	A man found him, and behold, he was wandering in the field; and the man asked him, "What are you looking for?"
Genesis	Ge	1	37	16	He said, "I am looking for my brothers; please tell me where they are pasturing the flock."
Genesis	Ge	1	37	17	Then the man said, "They have moved from here; for I heard them say, 'Let us go to Dothan.'" So Joseph went after his brothers and found them at Dothan.
Genesis	Ge	1	37	18	When they saw him from a distance and before he came close to them, they plotted against him to put him to death.
Genesis	Ge	1	37	19	They said to one another, "Here comes this dreamer!
Genesis	Ge	1	37	20	"Now then, come and let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits; and we will say, 'A wild beast devoured him.' Then let us see what will become of his dreams!"
Genesis	Ge	1	37	21	But Reuben heard this and rescued him out of their hands and said, "Let us not take his life."
Genesis	Ge	1	37	22	Reuben further said to them, "Shed no blood. Throw him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but do not lay hands on him"--that he might rescue him out of their hands, to restore him to his father.
Genesis	Ge	1	37	23	So it came about, when Joseph reached his brothers, that they stripped Joseph of his tunic, the varicolored tunic that was on him;
Genesis	Ge	1	37	24	and they took him and threw him into the pit. Now the pit was empty, without any water in it.
Genesis	Ge	1	37	25	Then they sat down to eat a meal. And as they raised their eyes and looked, behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing aromatic gum and balm and myrrh, on their way to bring them down to Egypt.
Genesis	Ge	1	37	26	Judah said to his brothers, "What profit is it for us to kill our brother and cover up his blood?
Genesis	Ge	1	37	27	"Come and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him, for he is our brother, our own flesh." And his brothers listened to him.
Genesis	Ge	1	37	28	Then some Midianite traders passed by, so they pulled him up and lifted Joseph out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels of silver. Thus they brought Joseph into Egypt.
Genesis	Ge	1	37	29	Now Reuben returned to the pit, and behold, Joseph was not in the pit; so he tore his garments.
Genesis	Ge	1	37	30	He returned to his brothers and said, "The boy is not there; as for me, where am I to go?"
Genesis	Ge	1	37	31	So they took Joseph's tunic, and slaughtered a male goat and dipped the tunic in the blood;
Genesis	Ge	1	37	32	and they sent the varicolored tunic and brought it to their father and said, "We found this; please examine it to see whether it is your son's tunic or not."
Genesis	Ge	1	37	33	Then he examined it and said, "It is my son's tunic. A wild beast has devoured him; Joseph has surely been torn to pieces!"
Genesis	Ge	1	37	34	So Jacob tore his clothes, and put sackcloth on his loins and mourned for his son many days.
Genesis	Ge	1	37	35	Then all his sons and all his daughters arose to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. And he said, "Surely I will go down to Sheol in mourning for my son." So his father wept for him.
Genesis	Ge	1	37	36	Meanwhile, the Midianites sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, Pharaoh's officer, the captain of the bodyguard.
Genesis	Ge	1	38	1	And it came about at that time, that Judah departed from his brothers and visited a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.
Genesis	Ge	1	38	2	Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua; and he took her and went in to her.
Genesis	Ge	1	38	3	So she conceived and bore a son and he named him Er.
Genesis	Ge	1	38	4	Then she conceived again and bore a son and named him Onan.
Genesis	Ge	1	38	5	She bore still another son and named him Shelah; and it was at Chezib that she bore him.
Genesis	Ge	1	38	6	Now Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.
Genesis	Ge	1	38	7	But Er, Judah's firstborn, was evil in the sight of the LORD, so the LORD took his life.
Genesis	Ge	1	38	8	Then Judah said to Onan, "Go in to your brother's wife, and perform your duty as a brother-in-law to her, and raise up offspring for your brother."
Genesis	Ge	1	38	9	Onan knew that the offspring would not be his; so when he went in to his brother's wife, he wasted his seed on the ground in order not to give offspring to his brother.
Genesis	Ge	1	38	10	But what he did was displeasing in the sight of the LORD; so He took his life also.
Genesis	Ge	1	38	11	Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, "Remain a widow in your father's house until my son Shelah grows up"; for he thought, "I am afraid that he too may die like his brothers." So Tamar went and lived in her father's house.
Genesis	Ge	1	38	12	Now after a considerable time Shua's daughter, the wife of Judah, died; and when the time of mourning was ended, Judah went up to his sheepshearers at Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
Genesis	Ge	1	38	13	It was told to Tamar, "Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep."
Genesis	Ge	1	38	14	So she removed her widow's garments and covered herself with a veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gateway of Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah had grown up, and she had not been given to him as a wife.
Genesis	Ge	1	38	15	When Judah saw her, he thought she was a harlot, for she had covered her face.
Genesis	Ge	1	38	16	So he turned aside to her by the road, and said, "Here now, let me come in to you"; for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, "What will you give me, that you may come in to me?"
Genesis	Ge	1	38	17	He said, therefore, "I will send you a young goat from the flock." She said, moreover, "Will you give a pledge until you send it?"
Genesis	Ge	1	38	18	He said, "What pledge shall I give you?" And she said, "Your seal and your cord, and your staff that is in your hand." So he gave them to her and went in to her, and she conceived by him.
Genesis	Ge	1	38	19	Then she arose and departed, and removed her veil and put on her widow's garments.
Genesis	Ge	1	38	20	When Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman's hand, he did not find her.
Genesis	Ge	1	38	21	He asked the men of her place, saying, "Where is the temple prostitute who was by the road at Enaim?" But they said, "There has been no temple prostitute here."
Genesis	Ge	1	38	22	So he returned to Judah, and said, "I did not find her; and furthermore, the men of the place said, 'There has been no temple prostitute here.'"
Genesis	Ge	1	38	23	Then Judah said, "Let her keep them, otherwise we will become a laughingstock. After all, I sent this young goat, but you did not find her."
Genesis	Ge	1	38	24	Now it was about three months later that Judah was informed, "Your daughter-in-law Tamar has played the harlot, and behold, she is also with child by harlotry." Then Judah said, "Bring her out and let her be burned!"
Genesis	Ge	1	38	25	It was while she was being brought out that she sent to her father-in-law, saying, "I am with child by the man to whom these things belong." And she said, "Please examine and see, whose signet ring and cords and staff are these?"
Genesis	Ge	1	38	26	Judah recognized them, and said, "She is more righteous than I, inasmuch as I did not give her to my son Shelah." And he did not have relations with her again.
Genesis	Ge	1	38	27	It came about at the time she was giving birth, that behold, there were twins in her womb.
Genesis	Ge	1	38	28	Moreover, it took place while she was giving birth, one put out a hand, and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand, saying, "This one came out first."
Genesis	Ge	1	38	29	But it came about as he drew back his hand, that behold, his brother came out. Then she said, "What a breach you have made for yourself!" So he was named Perez.
Genesis	Ge	1	38	30	Afterward his brother came out who had the scarlet thread on his hand; and he was named Zerah.
Genesis	Ge	1	39	1	Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an Egyptian officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the bodyguard, bought him from the Ishmaelites, who had taken him down there.
Genesis	Ge	1	39	2	The LORD was with Joseph, so he became a successful man. And he was in the house of his master, the Egyptian.
Genesis	Ge	1	39	3	Now his master saw that the LORD was with him and how the LORD caused all that he did to prosper in his hand.
Genesis	Ge	1	39	4	So Joseph found favor in his sight and became his personal servant; and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he owned he put in his charge.
Genesis	Ge	1	39	5	It came about that from the time he made him overseer in his house and over all that he owned, the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house on account of Joseph; thus the LORD'S blessing was upon all that he owned, in the house and in the field.
Genesis	Ge	1	39	6	So he left everything he owned in Joseph's charge; and with him there he did not concern himself with anything except the food which he ate. Now Joseph was handsome in form and appearance.
Genesis	Ge	1	39	7	It came about after these events that his master's wife looked with desire at Joseph, and she said, "Lie with me."
Genesis	Ge	1	39	8	But he refused and said to his master's wife, "Behold, with me here, my master does not concern himself with anything in the house, and he has put all that he owns in my charge.
Genesis	Ge	1	39	9	"There is no one greater in this house than I, and he has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How then could I do this great evil and sin against God?"
Genesis	Ge	1	39	10	As she spoke to Joseph day after day, he did not listen to her to lie beside her or be with her.
Genesis	Ge	1	39	11	Now it happened one day that he went into the house to do his work, and none of the men of the household was there inside.
Genesis	Ge	1	39	12	She caught him by his garment, saying, "Lie with me!" And he left his garment in her hand and fled, and went outside.
Genesis	Ge	1	39	13	When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled outside,
Genesis	Ge	1	39	14	she called to the men of her household and said to them, "See, he has brought in a Hebrew to us to make sport of us; he came in to me to lie with me, and I screamed.
Genesis	Ge	1	39	15	"When he heard that I raised my voice and screamed, he left his garment beside me and fled and went outside."
Genesis	Ge	1	39	16	So she left his garment beside her until his master came home.
Genesis	Ge	1	39	17	Then she spoke to him with these words, "The Hebrew slave, whom you brought to us, came in to me to make sport of me;
Genesis	Ge	1	39	18	and as I raised my voice and screamed, he left his garment beside me and fled outside."
Genesis	Ge	1	39	19	Now when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, "This is what your slave did to me," his anger burned.
Genesis	Ge	1	39	20	So Joseph's master took him and put him into the jail, the place where the king's prisoners were confined; and he was there in the jail.
Genesis	Ge	1	39	21	But the LORD was with Joseph and extended kindness to him, and gave him favor in the sight of the chief jailer.
Genesis	Ge	1	39	22	The chief jailer committed to Joseph's charge all the prisoners who were in the jail; so that whatever was done there, he was responsible for it.
Genesis	Ge	1	39	23	The chief jailer did not supervise anything under Joseph's charge because the LORD was with him; and whatever he did, the LORD made to prosper.
Genesis	Ge	1	40	1	Then it came about after these things, the cupbearer and the baker for the king of Egypt offended their lord, the king of Egypt.
Genesis	Ge	1	40	2	Pharaoh was furious with his two officials, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker.
Genesis	Ge	1	40	3	So he put them in confinement in the house of the captain of the bodyguard, in the jail, the same place where Joseph was imprisoned.
Genesis	Ge	1	40	4	The captain of the bodyguard put Joseph in charge of them, and he took care of them; and they were in confinement for some time.
Genesis	Ge	1	40	5	Then the cupbearer and the baker for the king of Egypt, who were confined in jail, both had a dream the same night, each man with his own dream and each dream with its own interpretation.
Genesis	Ge	1	40	6	When Joseph came to them in the morning and observed them, behold, they were dejected.
Genesis	Ge	1	40	7	He asked Pharaoh's officials who were with him in confinement in his master's house, "Why are your faces so sad today?"
Genesis	Ge	1	40	8	Then they said to him, "We have had a dream and there is no one to interpret it." Then Joseph said to them, "Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell it to me, please."
Genesis	Ge	1	40	9	So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, "In my dream, behold, there was a vine in front of me;
Genesis	Ge	1	40	10	and on the vine were three branches. And as it was budding, its blossoms came out, and its clusters produced ripe grapes.
Genesis	Ge	1	40	11	"Now Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; so I took the grapes and squeezed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I put the cup into Pharaoh's hand."
Genesis	Ge	1	40	12	Then Joseph said to him, "This is the interpretation of it: the three branches are three days;
Genesis	Ge	1	40	13	within three more days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office; and you will put Pharaoh's cup into his hand according to your former custom when you were his cupbearer.
Genesis	Ge	1	40	14	"Only keep me in mind when it goes well with you, and please do me a kindness by mentioning me to Pharaoh and get me out of this house.
Genesis	Ge	1	40	15	"For I was in fact kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing that they should have put me into the dungeon."
Genesis	Ge	1	40	16	When the chief baker saw that he had interpreted favorably, he said to Joseph, "I also saw in my dream, and behold, there were three baskets of white bread on my head;
Genesis	Ge	1	40	17	and in the top basket there were some of all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh, and the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head."
Genesis	Ge	1	40	18	Then Joseph answered and said, "This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days;
Genesis	Ge	1	40	19	within three more days Pharaoh will lift up your head from you and will hang you on a tree, and the birds will eat your flesh off you."
Genesis	Ge	1	40	20	Thus it came about on the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast for all his servants; and he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants.
Genesis	Ge	1	40	21	He restored the chief cupbearer to his office, and he put the cup into Pharaoh's hand;
Genesis	Ge	1	40	22	but he hanged the chief baker, just as Joseph had interpreted to them.
Genesis	Ge	1	40	23	Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	1	Now it happened at the end of two full years that Pharaoh had a dream, and behold, he was standing by the Nile.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	2	And lo, from the Nile there came up seven cows, sleek and fat; and they grazed in the marsh grass.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	3	Then behold, seven other cows came up after them from the Nile, ugly and gaunt, and they stood by the other cows on the bank of the Nile.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	4	The ugly and gaunt cows ate up the seven sleek and fat cows. Then Pharaoh awoke.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	5	He fell asleep and dreamed a second time; and behold, seven ears of grain came up on a single stalk, plump and good.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	6	Then behold, seven ears, thin and scorched by the east wind, sprouted up after them.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	7	The thin ears swallowed up the seven plump and full ears. Then Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	8	Now in the morning his spirit was troubled, so he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all its wise men. And Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	9	Then the chief cupbearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, "I would make mention today of my own offenses.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	10	"Pharaoh was furious with his servants, and he put me in confinement in the house of the captain of the bodyguard, both me and the chief baker.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	11	"We had a dream on the same night, he and I; each of us dreamed according to the interpretation of his own dream.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	12	"Now a Hebrew youth was with us there, a servant of the captain of the bodyguard, and we related them to him, and he interpreted our dreams for us. To each one he interpreted according to his own dream.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	13	"And just as he interpreted for us, so it happened; he restored me in my office, but he hanged him."
Genesis	Ge	1	41	14	Then Pharaoh sent and called for Joseph, and they hurriedly brought him out of the dungeon; and when he had shaved himself and changed his clothes, he came to Pharaoh.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	15	Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I have had a dream, but no one can interpret it; and I have heard it said about you, that when you hear a dream you can interpret it."
Genesis	Ge	1	41	16	Joseph then answered Pharaoh, saying, "It is not in me; God will give Pharaoh a favorable answer."
Genesis	Ge	1	41	17	So Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, "In my dream, behold, I was standing on the bank of the Nile;
Genesis	Ge	1	41	18	and behold, seven cows, fat and sleek came up out of the Nile, and they grazed in the marsh grass.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	19	"Lo, seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ugly and gaunt, such as I had never seen for ugliness in all the land of Egypt;
Genesis	Ge	1	41	20	and the lean and ugly cows ate up the first seven fat cows.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	21	"Yet when they had devoured them, it could not be detected that they had devoured them, for they were just as ugly as before. Then I awoke.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	22	"I saw also in my dream, and behold, seven ears, full and good, came up on a single stalk;
Genesis	Ge	1	41	23	and lo, seven ears, withered, thin, and scorched by the east wind, sprouted up after them;
Genesis	Ge	1	41	24	and the thin ears swallowed the seven good ears. Then I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me."
Genesis	Ge	1	41	25	Now Joseph said to Pharaoh, "Pharaoh's dreams are one and the same; God has told to Pharaoh what He is about to do.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	26	"The seven good cows are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years; the dreams are one and the same.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	27	"The seven lean and ugly cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven thin ears scorched by the east wind will be seven years of famine.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	28	"It is as I have spoken to Pharaoh: God has shown to Pharaoh what He is about to do.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	29	"Behold, seven years of great abundance are coming in all the land of Egypt;
Genesis	Ge	1	41	30	and after them seven years of famine will come, and all the abundance will be forgotten in the land of Egypt, and the famine will ravage the land.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	31	"So the abundance will be unknown in the land because of that subsequent famine; for it will be very severe.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	32	"Now as for the repeating of the dream to Pharaoh twice, it means that the matter is determined by God, and God will quickly bring it about.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	33	"Now let Pharaoh look for a man discerning and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	34	"Let Pharaoh take action to appoint overseers in charge of the land, and let him exact a fifth of the produce of the land of Egypt in the seven years of abundance.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	35	"Then let them gather all the food of these good years that are coming, and store up the grain for food in the cities under Pharaoh's authority, and let them guard it.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	36	"Let the food become as a reserve for the land for the seven years of famine which will occur in the land of Egypt, so that the land will not perish during the famine."
Genesis	Ge	1	41	37	Now the proposal seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his servants.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	38	Then Pharaoh said to his servants, "Can we find a man like this, in whom is a divine spirit?"
Genesis	Ge	1	41	39	So Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Since God has informed you of all this, there is no one so discerning and wise as you are.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	40	"You shall be over my house, and according to your command all my people shall do homage; only in the throne I will be greater than you."
Genesis	Ge	1	41	41	Pharaoh said to Joseph, "See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt."
Genesis	Ge	1	41	42	Then Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph's hand, and clothed him in garments of fine linen and put the gold necklace around his neck.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	43	He had him ride in his second chariot; and they proclaimed before him, "Bow the knee!" And he set him over all the land of Egypt.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	44	Moreover, Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Though I am Pharaoh, yet without your permission no one shall raise his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt."
Genesis	Ge	1	41	45	Then Pharaoh named Joseph Zaphenath-paneah; and he gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, as his wife. And Joseph went forth over the land of Egypt.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	46	Now Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh, king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and went through all the land of Egypt.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	47	During the seven years of plenty the land brought forth abundantly.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	48	So he gathered all the food of these seven years which occurred in the land of Egypt and placed the food in the cities; he placed in every city the food from its own surrounding fields.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	49	Thus Joseph stored up grain in great abundance like the sand of the sea, until he stopped measuring it, for it was beyond measure.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	50	Now before the year of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore to him.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	51	Joseph named the firstborn Manasseh, "For," he said, "God has made me forget all my trouble and all my father's household."
Genesis	Ge	1	41	52	He named the second Ephraim, "For," he said, "God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction."
Genesis	Ge	1	41	53	When the seven years of plenty which had been in the land of Egypt came to an end,
Genesis	Ge	1	41	54	and the seven years of famine began to come, just as Joseph had said, then there was famine in all the lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	55	So when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried out to Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, "Go to Joseph; whatever he says to you, you shall do."
Genesis	Ge	1	41	56	When the famine was spread over all the face of the earth, then Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold to the Egyptians; and the famine was severe in the land of Egypt.
Genesis	Ge	1	41	57	The people of all the earth came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph, because the famine was severe in all the earth.
Genesis	Ge	1	42	1	Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said to his sons, "Why are you staring at one another?"
Genesis	Ge	1	42	2	He said, "Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt; go down there and buy some for us from that place, so that we may live and not die."
Genesis	Ge	1	42	3	Then ten brothers of Joseph went down to buy grain from Egypt.
Genesis	Ge	1	42	4	But Jacob did not send Joseph's brother Benjamin with his brothers, for he said, "I am afraid that harm may befall him."
Genesis	Ge	1	42	5	So the sons of Israel came to buy grain among those who were coming, for the famine was in the land of Canaan also.
Genesis	Ge	1	42	6	Now Joseph was the ruler over the land; he was the one who sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph's brothers came and bowed down to him with their faces to the ground.
Genesis	Ge	1	42	7	When Joseph saw his brothers he recognized them, but he disguised himself to them and spoke to them harshly. And he said to them, "Where have you come from?" And they said, "From the land of Canaan, to buy food."
Genesis	Ge	1	42	8	But Joseph had recognized his brothers, although they did not recognize him.
Genesis	Ge	1	42	9	Joseph remembered the dreams which he had about them, and said to them, "You are spies; you have come to look at the undefended parts of our land."
Genesis	Ge	1	42	10	Then they said to him, "No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food.
Genesis	Ge	1	42	11	"We are all sons of one man; we are honest men, your servants are not spies."
Genesis	Ge	1	42	12	Yet he said to them, "No, but you have come to look at the undefended parts of our land!"
Genesis	Ge	1	42	13	But they said, "Your servants are twelve brothers in all, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is with our father today, and one is no longer alive."
Genesis	Ge	1	42	14	Joseph said to them, "It is as I said to you, you are spies;
Genesis	Ge	1	42	15	by this you will be tested: by the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go from this place unless your youngest brother comes here!
Genesis	Ge	1	42	16	"Send one of you that he may get your brother, while you remain confined, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you. But if not, by the life of Pharaoh, surely you are spies."
Genesis	Ge	1	42	17	So he put them all together in prison for three days.
Genesis	Ge	1	42	18	Now Joseph said to them on the third day, "Do this and live, for I fear God:
Genesis	Ge	1	42	19	if you are honest men, let one of your brothers be confined in your prison; but as for the rest of you, go, carry grain for the famine of your households,
Genesis	Ge	1	42	20	and bring your youngest brother to me, so your words may be verified, and you will not die." And they did so.
Genesis	Ge	1	42	21	Then they said to one another, "Truly we are guilty concerning our brother, because we saw the distress of his soul when he pleaded with us, yet we would not listen; therefore this distress has come upon us."
Genesis	Ge	1	42	22	Reuben answered them, saying, "Did I not tell you, 'Do not sin against the boy'; and you would not listen? Now comes the reckoning for his blood."
Genesis	Ge	1	42	23	They did not know, however, that Joseph understood, for there was an interpreter between them.
Genesis	Ge	1	42	24	He turned away from them and wept. But when he returned to them and spoke to them, he took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes.
Genesis	Ge	1	42	25	Then Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain and to restore every man's money in his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. And thus it was done for them.
Genesis	Ge	1	42	26	So they loaded their donkeys with their grain and departed from there.
Genesis	Ge	1	42	27	As one of them opened his sack to give his donkey fodder at the lodging place, he saw his money; and behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.
Genesis	Ge	1	42	28	Then he said to his brothers, "My money has been returned, and behold, it is even in my sack." And their hearts sank, and they turned trembling to one another, saying, "What is this that God has done to us?"
Genesis	Ge	1	42	29	When they came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them, saying,
Genesis	Ge	1	42	30	"The man, the lord of the land, spoke harshly with us, and took us for spies of the country.
Genesis	Ge	1	42	31	"But we said to him, 'We are honest men; we are not spies.
Genesis	Ge	1	42	32	'We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no longer alive, and the youngest is with our father today in the land of Canaan.'
Genesis	Ge	1	42	33	"The man, the lord of the land, said to us, 'By this I will know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me and take grain for the famine of your households, and go.
Genesis	Ge	1	42	34	'But bring your youngest brother to me that I may know that you are not spies, but honest men. I will give your brother to you, and you may trade in the land.'"
Genesis	Ge	1	42	35	Now it came about as they were emptying their sacks, that behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack; and when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were dismayed.
Genesis	Ge	1	42	36	Their father Jacob said to them, "You have bereaved me of my children: Joseph is no more, and Simeon is no more, and you would take Benjamin; all these things are against me."
Genesis	Ge	1	42	37	Then Reuben spoke to his father, saying, "You may put my two sons to death if I do not bring him back to you; put him in my care, and I will return him to you."
Genesis	Ge	1	42	38	But Jacob said, "My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he alone is left. If harm should befall him on the journey you are taking, then you will bring my gray hair down to Sheol in sorrow."
Genesis	Ge	1	43	1	Now the famine was severe in the land.
Genesis	Ge	1	43	2	So it came about when they had finished eating the grain which they had brought from Egypt, that their father said to them, "Go back, buy us a little food."
Genesis	Ge	1	43	3	Judah spoke to him, however, saying, "The man solemnly warned us, 'You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.'
Genesis	Ge	1	43	4	"If you send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food.
Genesis	Ge	1	43	5	"But if you do not send him, we will not go down; for the man said to us, 'You will not see my face unless your brother is with you.'"
Genesis	Ge	1	43	6	Then Israel said, "Why did you treat me so badly by telling the man whether you still had another brother?"
Genesis	Ge	1	43	7	But they said, "The man questioned particularly about us and our relatives, saying, 'Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?' So we answered his questions. Could we possibly know that he would say, 'Bring your brother down'?"
Genesis	Ge	1	43	8	Judah said to his father Israel, "Send the lad with me and we will arise and go, that we may live and not die, we as well as you and our little ones.
Genesis	Ge	1	43	9	"I myself will be surety for him; you may hold me responsible for him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him before you, then let me bear the blame before you forever.
Genesis	Ge	1	43	10	"For if we had not delayed, surely by now we could have returned twice."
Genesis	Ge	1	43	11	Then their father Israel said to them, "If it must be so, then do this: take some of the best products of the land in your bags, and carry down to the man as a present, a little balm and a little honey, aromatic gum and myrrh, pistachio nuts and almonds.
Genesis	Ge	1	43	12	"Take double the money in your hand, and take back in your hand the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks; perhaps it was a mistake.
Genesis	Ge	1	43	13	"Take your brother also, and arise, return to the man;
Genesis	Ge	1	43	14	and may God Almighty grant you compassion in the sight of the man, so that he will release to you your other brother and Benjamin. And as for me, if I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved."
Genesis	Ge	1	43	15	So the men took this present, and they took double the money in their hand, and Benjamin; then they arose and went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph.
Genesis	Ge	1	43	16	When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to his house steward, "Bring the men into the house, and slay an animal and make ready; for the men are to dine with me at noon."
Genesis	Ge	1	43	17	So the man did as Joseph said, and brought the men to Joseph's house.
Genesis	Ge	1	43	18	Now the men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph's house; and they said, "It is because of the money that was returned in our sacks the first time that we are being brought in, that he may seek occasion against us and fall upon us, and take us for slaves with our donkeys."
Genesis	Ge	1	43	19	So they came near to Joseph's house steward, and spoke to him at the entrance of the house,
Genesis	Ge	1	43	20	and said, "Oh, my lord, we indeed came down the first time to buy food,
Genesis	Ge	1	43	21	and it came about when we came to the lodging place, that we opened our sacks, and behold, each man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full. So we have brought it back in our hand.
Genesis	Ge	1	43	22	"We have also brought down other money in our hand to buy food; we do not know who put our money in our sacks."
Genesis	Ge	1	43	23	He said, "Be at ease, do not be afraid. Your God and the God of your father has given you treasure in your sacks; I had your money." Then he brought Simeon out to them.
Genesis	Ge	1	43	24	Then the man brought the men into Joseph's house and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their donkeys fodder.
Genesis	Ge	1	43	25	So they prepared the present for Joseph's coming at noon; for they had heard that they were to eat a meal there.
Genesis	Ge	1	43	26	When Joseph came home, they brought into the house to him the present which was in their hand and bowed to the ground before him.
Genesis	Ge	1	43	27	Then he asked them about their welfare, and said, "Is your old father well, of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?"
Genesis	Ge	1	43	28	They said, "Your servant our father is well; he is still alive." They bowed down in homage.
Genesis	Ge	1	43	29	As he lifted his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, he said, "Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me?" And he said, "May God be gracious to you, my son."
Genesis	Ge	1	43	30	Joseph hurried out for he was deeply stirred over his brother, and he sought a place to weep; and he entered his chamber and wept there.
Genesis	Ge	1	43	31	Then he washed his face and came out; and he controlled himself and said, "Serve the meal."
Genesis	Ge	1	43	32	So they served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians could not eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is loathsome to the Egyptians.
Genesis	Ge	1	43	33	Now they were seated before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth, and the men looked at one another in astonishment.
Genesis	Ge	1	43	34	He took portions to them from his own table, but Benjamin's portion was five times as much as any of theirs. So they feasted and drank freely with him.
Genesis	Ge	1	44	1	Then he commanded his house steward, saying, "Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man's money in the mouth of his sack.
Genesis	Ge	1	44	2	"Put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, and his money for the grain." And he did as Joseph had told him.
Genesis	Ge	1	44	3	As soon as it was light, the men were sent away, they with their donkeys.
Genesis	Ge	1	44	4	They had just gone out of the city, and were not far off, when Joseph said to his house steward, "Up, follow the men; and when you overtake them, say to them, 'Why have you repaid evil for good?
Genesis	Ge	1	44	5	'Is not this the one from which my lord drinks and which he indeed uses for divination? You have done wrong in doing this.'"
Genesis	Ge	1	44	6	So he overtook them and spoke these words to them.
Genesis	Ge	1	44	7	They said to him, "Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing.
Genesis	Ge	1	44	8	"Behold, the money which we found in the mouth of our sacks we have brought back to you from the land of Canaan. How then could we steal silver or gold from your lord's house?
Genesis	Ge	1	44	9	"With whomever of your servants it is found, let him die, and we also will be my lord's slaves."
Genesis	Ge	1	44	10	So he said, "Now let it also be according to your words; he with whom it is found shall be my slave, and the rest of you shall be innocent."
Genesis	Ge	1	44	11	Then they hurried, each man lowered his sack to the ground, and each man opened his sack.
Genesis	Ge	1	44	12	He searched, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest, and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.
Genesis	Ge	1	44	13	Then they tore their clothes, and when each man loaded his donkey, they returned to the city.
Genesis	Ge	1	44	14	When Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house, he was still there, and they fell to the ground before him.
Genesis	Ge	1	44	15	Joseph said to them, "What is this deed that you have done? Do you not know that such a man as I can indeed practice divination?"
Genesis	Ge	1	44	16	So Judah said, "What can we say to my lord? What can we speak? And how can we justify ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants; behold, we are my lord's slaves, both we and the one in whose possession the cup has been found."
Genesis	Ge	1	44	17	But he said, "Far be it from me to do this. The man in whose possession the cup has been found, he shall be my slave; but as for you, go up in peace to your father."
Genesis	Ge	1	44	18	Then Judah approached him, and said, "Oh my lord, may your servant please speak a word in my lord's ears, and do not be angry with your servant; for you are equal to Pharaoh.
Genesis	Ge	1	44	19	"My lord asked his servants, saying, 'Have you a father or a brother?'
Genesis	Ge	1	44	20	"We said to my lord, 'We have an old father and a little child of his old age. Now his brother is dead, so he alone is left of his mother, and his father loves him.'
Genesis	Ge	1	44	21	"Then you said to your servants, 'Bring him down to me that I may set my eyes on him.'
Genesis	Ge	1	44	22	"But we said to my lord, 'The lad cannot leave his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die.'
Genesis	Ge	1	44	23	"You said to your servants, however, 'Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will not see my face again.'
Genesis	Ge	1	44	24	"Thus it came about when we went up to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.
Genesis	Ge	1	44	25	"Our father said, 'Go back, buy us a little food.'
Genesis	Ge	1	44	26	"But we said, 'We cannot go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down; for we cannot see the man's face unless our youngest brother is with us.'
Genesis	Ge	1	44	27	"Your servant my father said to us, 'You know that my wife bore me two sons;
Genesis	Ge	1	44	28	and the one went out from me, and I said, "Surely he is torn in pieces," and I have not seen him since.
Genesis	Ge	1	44	29	'If you take this one also from me, and harm befalls him, you will bring my gray hair down to Sheol in sorrow.'
Genesis	Ge	1	44	30	"Now, therefore, when I come to your servant my father, and the lad is not with us, since his life is bound up in the lad's life,
Genesis	Ge	1	44	31	when he sees that the lad is not with us, he will die. Thus your servants will bring the gray hair of your servant our father down to Sheol in sorrow.
Genesis	Ge	1	44	32	"For your servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, 'If I do not bring him back to you, then let me bear the blame before my father forever.'
Genesis	Ge	1	44	33	"Now, therefore, please let your servant remain instead of the lad a slave to my lord, and let the lad go up with his brothers.
Genesis	Ge	1	44	34	"For how shall I go up to my father if the lad is not with me--for fear that I see the evil that would overtake my father?"
Genesis	Ge	1	45	1	Then Joseph could not control himself before all those who stood by him, and he cried, "Have everyone go out from me." So there was no man with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers.
Genesis	Ge	1	45	2	He wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard it, and the household of Pharaoh heard of it.
Genesis	Ge	1	45	3	Then Joseph said to his brothers, "I am Joseph! Is my father still alive?" But his brothers could not answer him, for they were dismayed at his presence.
Genesis	Ge	1	45	4	Then Joseph said to his brothers, "Please come closer to me." And they came closer. And he said, "I am your brother Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt.
Genesis	Ge	1	45	5	"Now do not be grieved or angry with yourselves, because you sold me here, for God sent me before you to preserve life.
Genesis	Ge	1	45	6	"For the famine has been in the land these two years, and there are still five years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvesting.
Genesis	Ge	1	45	7	"God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth, and to keep you alive by a great deliverance.
Genesis	Ge	1	45	8	"Now, therefore, it was not you who sent me here, but God; and He has made me a father to Pharaoh and lord of all his household and ruler over all the land of Egypt.
Genesis	Ge	1	45	9	"Hurry and go up to my father, and say to him, 'Thus says your son Joseph, "God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me, do not delay.
Genesis	Ge	1	45	10	"You shall live in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near me, you and your children and your children's children and your flocks and your herds and all that you have.
Genesis	Ge	1	45	11	"There I will also provide for you, for there are still five years of famine to come, and you and your household and all that you have would be impoverished."'
Genesis	Ge	1	45	12	"Behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see, that it is my mouth which is speaking to you.
Genesis	Ge	1	45	13	"Now you must tell my father of all my splendor in Egypt, and all that you have seen; and you must hurry and bring my father down here."
Genesis	Ge	1	45	14	Then he fell on his brother Benjamin's neck and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck.
Genesis	Ge	1	45	15	He kissed all his brothers and wept on them, and afterward his brothers talked with him.
Genesis	Ge	1	45	16	Now when the news was heard in Pharaoh's house that Joseph's brothers had come, it pleased Pharaoh and his servants.
Genesis	Ge	1	45	17	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Say to your brothers, 'Do this: load your beasts and go to the land of Canaan,
Genesis	Ge	1	45	18	and take your father and your households and come to me, and I will give you the best of the land of Egypt and you will eat the fat of the land.'
Genesis	Ge	1	45	19	"Now you are ordered, 'Do this: take wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives, and bring your father and come.
Genesis	Ge	1	45	20	'Do not concern yourselves with your goods, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.'"
Genesis	Ge	1	45	21	Then the sons of Israel did so; and Joseph gave them wagons according to the command of Pharaoh, and gave them provisions for the journey.
Genesis	Ge	1	45	22	To each of them he gave changes of garments, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of garments.
Genesis	Ge	1	45	23	To his father he sent as follows: ten donkeys loaded with the best things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and sustenance for his father on the journey.
Genesis	Ge	1	45	24	So he sent his brothers away, and as they departed, he said to them, "Do not quarrel on the journey."
Genesis	Ge	1	45	25	Then they went up from Egypt, and came to the land of Canaan to their father Jacob.
Genesis	Ge	1	45	26	They told him, saying, "Joseph is still alive, and indeed he is ruler over all the land of Egypt." But he was stunned, for he did not believe them.
Genesis	Ge	1	45	27	When they told him all the words of Joseph that he had spoken to them, and when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of their father Jacob revived.
Genesis	Ge	1	45	28	Then Israel said, "It is enough; my son Joseph is still alive. I will go and see him before I die."
Genesis	Ge	1	46	1	So Israel set out with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.
Genesis	Ge	1	46	2	God spoke to Israel in visions of the night and said, "Jacob, Jacob." And he said, "Here I am."
Genesis	Ge	1	46	3	He said, "I am God, the God of your father; do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you a great nation there.
Genesis	Ge	1	46	4	"I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also surely bring you up again; and Joseph will close your eyes."
Genesis	Ge	1	46	5	Then Jacob arose from Beersheba; and the sons of Israel carried their father Jacob and their little ones and their wives in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.
Genesis	Ge	1	46	6	They took their livestock and their property, which they had acquired in the land of Canaan, and came to Egypt, Jacob and all his descendants with him:
Genesis	Ge	1	46	7	his sons and his grandsons with him, his daughters and his granddaughters, and all his descendants he brought with him to Egypt.
Genesis	Ge	1	46	8	Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, Jacob and his sons, who went to Egypt: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.
Genesis	Ge	1	46	9	The sons of Reuben: Hanoch and Pallu and Hezron and Carmi.
Genesis	Ge	1	46	10	The sons of Simeon: Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman.
Genesis	Ge	1	46	11	The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
Genesis	Ge	1	46	12	The sons of Judah: Er and Onan and Shelah and Perez and Zerah (but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan). And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.
Genesis	Ge	1	46	13	The sons of Issachar: Tola and Puvvah and Iob and Shimron.
Genesis	Ge	1	46	14	The sons of Zebulun: Sered and Elon and Jahleel.
Genesis	Ge	1	46	15	These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan-aram, with his daughter Dinah; all his sons and his daughters numbered thirty-three.
Genesis	Ge	1	46	16	The sons of Gad: Ziphion and Haggi, Shuni and Ezbon, Eri and Arodi and Areli.
Genesis	Ge	1	46	17	The sons of Asher: Imnah and Ishvah and Ishvi and Beriah and their sister Serah. And the sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel.
Genesis	Ge	1	46	18	These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah; and she bore to Jacob these sixteen persons.
Genesis	Ge	1	46	19	The sons of Jacob's wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
Genesis	Ge	1	46	20	Now to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, bore to him.
Genesis	Ge	1	46	21	The sons of Benjamin: Bela and Becher and Ashbel, Gera and Naaman, Ehi and Rosh, Muppim and Huppim and Ard.
Genesis	Ge	1	46	22	These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob; there were fourteen persons in all.
Genesis	Ge	1	46	23	The sons of Dan: Hushim.
Genesis	Ge	1	46	24	The sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel and Guni and Jezer and Shillem.
Genesis	Ge	1	46	25	These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel, and she bore these to Jacob; there were seven persons in all.
Genesis	Ge	1	46	26	All the persons belonging to Jacob, who came to Egypt, his direct descendants, not including the wives of Jacob's sons, were sixty-six persons in all,
Genesis	Ge	1	46	27	and the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt were two; all the persons of the house of Jacob, who came to Egypt, were seventy.
Genesis	Ge	1	46	28	Now he sent Judah before him to Joseph, to point out the way before him to Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.
Genesis	Ge	1	46	29	Joseph prepared his chariot and went up to Goshen to meet his father Israel; as soon as he appeared before him, he fell on his neck and wept on his neck a long time.
Genesis	Ge	1	46	30	Then Israel said to Joseph, "Now let me die, since I have seen your face, that you are still alive."
Genesis	Ge	1	46	31	Joseph said to his brothers and to his father's household, "I will go up and tell Pharaoh, and will say to him, 'My brothers and my father's household, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me;
Genesis	Ge	1	46	32	and the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of livestock; and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have.'
Genesis	Ge	1	46	33	"When Pharaoh calls you and says, 'What is your occupation?'
Genesis	Ge	1	46	34	you shall say, 'Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now, both we and our fathers,' that you may live in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is loathsome to the Egyptians."
Genesis	Ge	1	47	1	Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, and said, "My father and my brothers and their flocks and their herds and all that they have, have come out of the land of Canaan; and behold, they are in the land of Goshen."
Genesis	Ge	1	47	2	He took five men from among his brothers and presented them to Pharaoh.
Genesis	Ge	1	47	3	Then Pharaoh said to his brothers, "What is your occupation?" So they said to Pharaoh, "Your servants are shepherds, both we and our fathers."
Genesis	Ge	1	47	4	They said to Pharaoh, "We have come to sojourn in the land, for there is no pasture for your servants' flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. Now, therefore, please let your servants live in the land of Goshen."
Genesis	Ge	1	47	5	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Your father and your brothers have come to you.
Genesis	Ge	1	47	6	"The land of Egypt is at your disposal; settle your father and your brothers in the best of the land, let them live in the land of Goshen; and if you know any capable men among them, then put them in charge of my livestock."
Genesis	Ge	1	47	7	Then Joseph brought his father Jacob and presented him to Pharaoh; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
Genesis	Ge	1	47	8	Pharaoh said to Jacob, "How many years have you lived?"
Genesis	Ge	1	47	9	So Jacob said to Pharaoh, "The years of my sojourning are one hundred and thirty; few and unpleasant have been the years of my life, nor have they attained the years that my fathers lived during the days of their sojourning."
Genesis	Ge	1	47	10	And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from his presence.
Genesis	Ge	1	47	11	So Joseph settled his father and his brothers and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had ordered.
Genesis	Ge	1	47	12	Joseph provided his father and his brothers and all his father's household with food, according to their little ones.
Genesis	Ge	1	47	13	Now there was no food in all the land, because the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished because of the famine.
Genesis	Ge	1	47	14	Joseph gathered all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan for the grain which they bought, and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.
Genesis	Ge	1	47	15	When the money was all spent in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, "Give us food, for why should we die in your presence? For our money is gone."
Genesis	Ge	1	47	16	Then Joseph said, "Give up your livestock, and I will give you food for your livestock, since your money is gone."
Genesis	Ge	1	47	17	So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them food in exchange for the horses and the flocks and the herds and the donkeys; and he fed them with food in exchange for all their livestock that year.
Genesis	Ge	1	47	18	When that year was ended, they came to him the next year and said to him, "We will not hide from my lord that our money is all spent, and the cattle are my lord's. There is nothing left for my lord except our bodies and our lands.
Genesis	Ge	1	47	19	"Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for food, and we and our land will be slaves to Pharaoh. So give us seed, that we may live and not die, and that the land may not be desolate."
Genesis	Ge	1	47	20	So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for every Egyptian sold his field, because the famine was severe upon them. Thus the land became Pharaoh's.
Genesis	Ge	1	47	21	As for the people, he removed them to the cities from one end of Egypt's border to the other.
Genesis	Ge	1	47	22	Only the land of the priests he did not buy, for the priests had an allotment from Pharaoh, and they lived off the allotment which Pharaoh gave them. Therefore, they did not sell their land.
Genesis	Ge	1	47	23	Then Joseph said to the people, "Behold, I have today bought you and your land for Pharaoh; now, here is seed for you, and you may sow the land.
Genesis	Ge	1	47	24	"At the harvest you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four-fifths shall be your own for seed of the field and for your food and for those of your households and as food for your little ones."
Genesis	Ge	1	47	25	So they said, "You have saved our lives! Let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's slaves."
Genesis	Ge	1	47	26	Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt valid to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; only the land of the priests did not become Pharaoh's.
Genesis	Ge	1	47	27	Now Israel lived in the land of Egypt, in Goshen, and they acquired property in it and were fruitful and became very numerous.
Genesis	Ge	1	47	28	Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years; so the length of Jacob's life was one hundred and forty-seven years.
Genesis	Ge	1	47	29	When the time for Israel to die drew near, he called his son Joseph and said to him, "Please, if I have found favor in your sight, place now your hand under my thigh and deal with me in kindness and faithfulness. Please do not bury me in Egypt,
Genesis	Ge	1	47	30	but when I lie down with my fathers, you shall carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place." And he said, "I will do as you have said."
Genesis	Ge	1	47	31	He said, "Swear to me." So he swore to him. Then Israel bowed in worship at the head of the bed.
Genesis	Ge	1	48	1	Now it came about after these things that Joseph was told, "Behold, your father is sick." So he took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim with him.
Genesis	Ge	1	48	2	When it was told to Jacob, "Behold, your son Joseph has come to you," Israel collected his strength and sat up in the bed.
Genesis	Ge	1	48	3	Then Jacob said to Joseph, "God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me,
Genesis	Ge	1	48	4	and He said to me, 'Behold, I will make you fruitful and numerous, and I will make you a company of peoples, and will give this land to your descendants after you for an everlasting possession.'
Genesis	Ge	1	48	5	"Now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon are.
Genesis	Ge	1	48	6	"But your offspring that have been born after them shall be yours; they shall be called by the names of their brothers in their inheritance.
Genesis	Ge	1	48	7	"Now as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died, to my sorrow, in the land of Canaan on the journey, when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem)."
Genesis	Ge	1	48	8	When Israel saw Joseph's sons, he said, "Who are these?"
Genesis	Ge	1	48	9	Joseph said to his father, "They are my sons, whom God has given me here." So he said, "Bring them to me, please, that I may bless them."
Genesis	Ge	1	48	10	Now the eyes of Israel were so dim from age that he could not see. Then Joseph brought them close to him, and he kissed them and embraced them.
Genesis	Ge	1	48	11	Israel said to Joseph, "I never expected to see your face, and behold, God has let me see your children as well."
Genesis	Ge	1	48	12	Then Joseph took them from his knees, and bowed with his face to the ground.
Genesis	Ge	1	48	13	Joseph took them both, Ephraim with his right hand toward Israel's left, and Manasseh with his left hand toward Israel's right, and brought them close to him.
Genesis	Ge	1	48	14	But Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it on the head of Ephraim, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh's head, crossing his hands, although Manasseh was the firstborn.
Genesis	Ge	1	48	15	He blessed Joseph, and said, "The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, The God who has been my shepherd all my life to this day,
Genesis	Ge	1	48	16	The angel who has redeemed me from all evil, Bless the lads; And may my name live on in them, And the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; And may they grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth."
Genesis	Ge	1	48	17	When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on Ephraim's head, it displeased him; and he grasped his father's hand to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.
Genesis	Ge	1	48	18	Joseph said to his father, "Not so, my father, for this one is the firstborn. Place your right hand on his head."
Genesis	Ge	1	48	19	But his father refused and said, "I know, my son, I know; he also will become a people and he also will be great. However, his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his descendants shall become a multitude of nations."
Genesis	Ge	1	48	20	He blessed them that day, saying, "By you Israel will pronounce blessing, saying, 'May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh!'" Thus he put Ephraim before Manasseh.
Genesis	Ge	1	48	21	Then Israel said to Joseph, "Behold, I am about to die, but God will be with you, and bring you back to the land of your fathers.
Genesis	Ge	1	48	22	"I give you one portion more than your brothers, which I took from the hand of the Amorite with my sword and my bow."
Genesis	Ge	1	49	1	Then Jacob summoned his sons and said, "Assemble yourselves that I may tell you what will befall you in the days to come.
Genesis	Ge	1	49	2	"Gather together and hear, O sons of Jacob; And listen to Israel your father.
Genesis	Ge	1	49	3	"Reuben, you are my firstborn; My might and the beginning of my strength, Preeminent in dignity and preeminent in power.
Genesis	Ge	1	49	4	"Uncontrolled as water, you shall not have preeminence, Because you went up to your father's bed; Then you defiled it--he went up to my couch.
Genesis	Ge	1	49	5	"Simeon and Levi are brothers; Their swords are implements of violence.
Genesis	Ge	1	49	6	"Let my soul not enter into their council; Let not my glory be united with their assembly; Because in their anger they slew men, And in their self-will they lamed oxen.
Genesis	Ge	1	49	7	"Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce; And their wrath, for it is cruel. I will disperse them in Jacob, And scatter them in Israel.
Genesis	Ge	1	49	8	"Judah, your brothers shall praise you; Your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies; Your father's sons shall bow down to you.
Genesis	Ge	1	49	9	"Judah is a lion's whelp; From the prey, my son, you have gone up. He couches, he lies down as a lion, And as a lion, who dares rouse him up?
Genesis	Ge	1	49	10	"The scepter shall not depart from Judah, Nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, Until Shiloh comes, And to him shall be the obedience of the peoples.
Genesis	Ge	1	49	11	"He ties his foal to the vine, And his donkey's colt to the choice vine; He washes his garments in wine, And his robes in the blood of grapes.
Genesis	Ge	1	49	12	"His eyes are dull from wine, And his teeth white from milk.
Genesis	Ge	1	49	13	"Zebulun will dwell at the seashore; And he shall be a haven for ships, And his flank shall be toward Sidon.
Genesis	Ge	1	49	14	"Issachar is a strong donkey, Lying down between the sheepfolds.
Genesis	Ge	1	49	15	"When he saw that a resting place was good And that the land was pleasant, He bowed his shoulder to bear burdens, And became a slave at forced labor.
Genesis	Ge	1	49	16	"Dan shall judge his people, As one of the tribes of Israel.
Genesis	Ge	1	49	17	"Dan shall be a serpent in the way, A horned snake in the path, That bites the horse's heels, So that his rider falls backward.
Genesis	Ge	1	49	18	"For Your salvation I wait, O LORD.
Genesis	Ge	1	49	19	"As for Gad, raiders shall raid him, But he will raid at their heels.
Genesis	Ge	1	49	20	"As for Asher, his food shall be rich, And he will yield royal dainties.
Genesis	Ge	1	49	21	"Naphtali is a doe let loose, He gives beautiful words.
Genesis	Ge	1	49	22	"Joseph is a fruitful bough, A fruitful bough by a spring; Its branches run over a wall.
Genesis	Ge	1	49	23	"The archers bitterly attacked him, And shot at him and harassed him;
Genesis	Ge	1	49	24	But his bow remained firm, And his arms were agile, From the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob (From there is the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel),
Genesis	Ge	1	49	25	From the God of your father who helps you, And by the Almighty who blesses you With blessings of heaven above, Blessings of the deep that lies beneath, Blessings of the breasts and of the womb.
Genesis	Ge	1	49	26	"The blessings of your father Have surpassed the blessings of my ancestors Up to the utmost bound of the everlasting hills; May they be on the head of Joseph, And on the crown of the head of the one distinguished among his brothers.
Genesis	Ge	1	49	27	"Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; In the morning he devours the prey, And in the evening he divides the spoil."
Genesis	Ge	1	49	28	All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said to them when he blessed them. He blessed them, every one with the blessing appropriate to him.
Genesis	Ge	1	49	29	Then he charged them and said to them, "I am about to be gathered to my people; bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,
Genesis	Ge	1	49	30	in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought along with the field from Ephron the Hittite for a burial site.
Genesis	Ge	1	49	31	"There they buried Abraham and his wife Sarah, there they buried Isaac and his wife Rebekah, and there I buried Leah--
Genesis	Ge	1	49	32	the field and the cave that is in it, purchased from the sons of Heth."
Genesis	Ge	1	49	33	When Jacob finished charging his sons, he drew his feet into the bed and breathed his last, and was gathered to his people.
Genesis	Ge	1	50	1	Then Joseph fell on his father's face, and wept over him and kissed him.
Genesis	Ge	1	50	2	Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel.
Genesis	Ge	1	50	3	Now forty days were required for it, for such is the period required for embalming. And the Egyptians wept for him seventy days.
Genesis	Ge	1	50	4	When the days of mourning for him were past, Joseph spoke to the household of Pharaoh, saying, "If now I have found favor in your sight, please speak to Pharaoh, saying,
Genesis	Ge	1	50	5	'My father made me swear, saying, "Behold, I am about to die; in my grave which I dug for myself in the land of Canaan, there you shall bury me." Now therefore, please let me go up and bury my father; then I will return.'"
Genesis	Ge	1	50	6	Pharaoh said, "Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear."
Genesis	Ge	1	50	7	So Joseph went up to bury his father, and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his household and all the elders of the land of Egypt,
Genesis	Ge	1	50	8	and all the household of Joseph and his brothers and his father's household; they left only their little ones and their flocks and their herds in the land of Goshen.
Genesis	Ge	1	50	9	There also went up with him both chariots and horsemen; and it was a very great company.
Genesis	Ge	1	50	10	When they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, they lamented there with a very great and sorrowful lamentation; and he observed seven days mourning for his father.
Genesis	Ge	1	50	11	Now when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, "This is a grievous mourning for the Egyptians." Therefore it was named Abel-mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.
Genesis	Ge	1	50	12	Thus his sons did for him as he had charged them;
Genesis	Ge	1	50	13	for his sons carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre, which Abraham had bought along with the field for a burial site from Ephron the Hittite.
Genesis	Ge	1	50	14	After he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brothers, and all who had gone up with him to bury his father.
Genesis	Ge	1	50	15	When Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, "What if Joseph bears a grudge against us and pays us back in full for all the wrong which we did to him!"
Genesis	Ge	1	50	16	So they sent a message to Joseph, saying, "Your father charged before he died, saying,
Genesis	Ge	1	50	17	'Thus you shall say to Joseph, "Please forgive, I beg you, the transgression of your brothers and their sin, for they did you wrong."' And now, please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father." And Joseph wept when they spoke to him.
Genesis	Ge	1	50	18	Then his brothers also came and fell down before him and said, "Behold, we are your servants."
Genesis	Ge	1	50	19	But Joseph said to them, "Do not be afraid, for am I in God's place?
Genesis	Ge	1	50	20	"As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good in order to bring about this present result, to preserve many people alive.
Genesis	Ge	1	50	21	"So therefore, do not be afraid; I will provide for you and your little ones." So he comforted them and spoke kindly to them.
Genesis	Ge	1	50	22	Now Joseph stayed in Egypt, he and his father's household, and Joseph lived one hundred and ten years.
Genesis	Ge	1	50	23	Joseph saw the third generation of Ephraim's sons; also the sons of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were born on Joseph's knees.
Genesis	Ge	1	50	24	Joseph said to his brothers, "I am about to die, but God will surely take care of you and bring you up from this land to the land which He promised on oath to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob."
Genesis	Ge	1	50	25	Then Joseph made the sons of Israel swear, saying, "God will surely take care of you, and you shall carry my bones up from here."
Genesis	Ge	1	50	26	So Joseph died at the age of one hundred and ten years; and he was embalmed and placed in a coffin in Egypt.
Exodus	Exo	2	1	1	Now these are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob; they came each one with his household:
Exodus	Exo	2	1	2	Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah;
Exodus	Exo	2	1	3	Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin;
Exodus	Exo	2	1	4	Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.
Exodus	Exo	2	1	5	All the persons who came from the loins of Jacob were seventy in number, but Joseph was already in Egypt.
Exodus	Exo	2	1	6	Joseph died, and all his brothers and all that generation.
Exodus	Exo	2	1	7	But the sons of Israel were fruitful and increased greatly, and multiplied, and became exceedingly mighty, so that the land was filled with them.
Exodus	Exo	2	1	8	Now a new king arose over Egypt, who did not know Joseph.
Exodus	Exo	2	1	9	He said to his people, "Behold, the people of the sons of Israel are more and mightier than we.
Exodus	Exo	2	1	10	"Come, let us deal wisely with them, or else they will multiply and in the event of war, they will also join themselves to those who hate us, and fight against us and depart from the land."
Exodus	Exo	2	1	11	So they appointed taskmasters over them to afflict them with hard labor. And they built for Pharaoh storage cities, Pithom and Raamses.
Exodus	Exo	2	1	12	But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread out, so that they were in dread of the sons of Israel.
Exodus	Exo	2	1	13	The Egyptians compelled the sons of Israel to labor rigorously;
Exodus	Exo	2	1	14	and they made their lives bitter with hard labor in mortar and bricks and at all kinds of labor in the field, all their labors which they rigorously imposed on them.
Exodus	Exo	2	1	15	Then the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah and the other was named Puah;
Exodus	Exo	2	1	16	and he said, "When you are helping the Hebrew women to give birth and see them upon the birthstool, if it is a son, then you shall put him to death; but if it is a daughter, then she shall live."
Exodus	Exo	2	1	17	But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt had commanded them, but let the boys live.
Exodus	Exo	2	1	18	So the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said to them, "Why have you done this thing, and let the boys live?"
Exodus	Exo	2	1	19	The midwives said to Pharaoh, "Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife can get to them."
Exodus	Exo	2	1	20	So God was good to the midwives, and the people multiplied, and became very mighty.
Exodus	Exo	2	1	21	Because the midwives feared God, He established households for them.
Exodus	Exo	2	1	22	Then Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, "Every son who is born you are to cast into the Nile, and every daughter you are to keep alive."
Exodus	Exo	2	2	1	Now a man from the house of Levi went and married a daughter of Levi.
Exodus	Exo	2	2	2	The woman conceived and bore a son; and when she saw that he was beautiful, she hid him for three months.
Exodus	Exo	2	2	3	But when she could hide him no longer, she got him a wicker basket and covered it over with tar and pitch. Then she put the child into it and set it among the reeds by the bank of the Nile.
Exodus	Exo	2	2	4	His sister stood at a distance to find out what would happen to him.
Exodus	Exo	2	2	5	The daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the Nile, with her maidens walking alongside the Nile; and she saw the basket among the reeds and sent her maid, and she brought it to her.
Exodus	Exo	2	2	6	When she opened it, she saw the child, and behold, the boy was crying. And she had pity on him and said, "This is one of the Hebrews' children."
Exodus	Exo	2	2	7	Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, "Shall I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women that she may nurse the child for you?"
Exodus	Exo	2	2	8	Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Go ahead." So the girl went and called the child's mother.
Exodus	Exo	2	2	9	Then Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this child away and nurse him for me and I will give you your wages." So the woman took the child and nursed him.
Exodus	Exo	2	2	10	The child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter and he became her son. And she named him Moses, and said, "Because I drew him out of the water."
Exodus	Exo	2	2	11	Now it came about in those days, when Moses had grown up, that he went out to his brethren and looked on their hard labors; and he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his brethren.
Exodus	Exo	2	2	12	So he looked this way and that, and when he saw there was no one around, he struck down the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.
Exodus	Exo	2	2	13	He went out the next day, and behold, two Hebrews were fighting with each other; and he said to the offender, "Why are you striking your companion?"
Exodus	Exo	2	2	14	But he said, "Who made you a prince or a judge over us? Are you intending to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?" Then Moses was afraid and said, "Surely the matter has become known."
Exodus	Exo	2	2	15	When Pharaoh heard of this matter, he tried to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the presence of Pharaoh and settled in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well.
Exodus	Exo	2	2	16	Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters; and they came to draw water and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.
Exodus	Exo	2	2	17	Then the shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and helped them and watered their flock.
Exodus	Exo	2	2	18	When they came to Reuel their father, he said, "Why have you come back so soon today?"
Exodus	Exo	2	2	19	So they said, "An Egyptian delivered us from the hand of the shepherds, and what is more, he even drew the water for us and watered the flock."
Exodus	Exo	2	2	20	He said to his daughters, "Where is he then? Why is it that you have left the man behind? Invite him to have something to eat."
Exodus	Exo	2	2	21	Moses was willing to dwell with the man, and he gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses.
Exodus	Exo	2	2	22	Then she gave birth to a son, and he named him Gershom, for he said, "I have been a sojourner in a foreign land."
Exodus	Exo	2	2	23	Now it came about in the course of those many days that the king of Egypt died. And the sons of Israel sighed because of the bondage, and they cried out; and their cry for help because of their bondage rose up to God.
Exodus	Exo	2	2	24	So God heard their groaning; and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
Exodus	Exo	2	2	25	God saw the sons of Israel, and God took notice of them.
Exodus	Exo	2	3	1	Now Moses was pasturing the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian; and he led the flock to the west side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.
Exodus	Exo	2	3	2	The angel of the LORD appeared to him in a blazing fire from the midst of a bush; and he looked, and behold, the bush was burning with fire, yet the bush was not consumed.
Exodus	Exo	2	3	3	So Moses said, "I must turn aside now and see this marvelous sight, why the bush is not burned up."
Exodus	Exo	2	3	4	When the LORD saw that he turned aside to look, God called to him from the midst of the bush and said, "Moses, Moses!" And he said, "Here I am."
Exodus	Exo	2	3	5	Then He said, "Do not come near here; remove your sandals from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground."
Exodus	Exo	2	3	6	He said also, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." Then Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.
Exodus	Exo	2	3	7	The LORD said, "I have surely seen the affliction of My people who are in Egypt, and have given heed to their cry because of their taskmasters, for I am aware of their sufferings.
Exodus	Exo	2	3	8	"So I have come down to deliver them from the power of the Egyptians, and to bring them up from that land to a good and spacious land, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite.
Exodus	Exo	2	3	9	"Now, behold, the cry of the sons of Israel has come to Me; furthermore, I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians are oppressing them.
Exodus	Exo	2	3	10	"Therefore, come now, and I will send you to Pharaoh, so that you may bring My people, the sons of Israel, out of Egypt."
Exodus	Exo	2	3	11	But Moses said to God, "Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the sons of Israel out of Egypt?"
Exodus	Exo	2	3	12	And He said, "Certainly I will be with you, and this shall be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall worship God at this mountain."
Exodus	Exo	2	3	13	Then Moses said to God, "Behold, I am going to the sons of Israel, and I will say to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you.' Now they may say to me, 'What is His name?' What shall I say to them?"
Exodus	Exo	2	3	14	God said to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM"; and He said, "Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, 'I AM has sent me to you.'"
Exodus	Exo	2	3	15	God, furthermore, said to Moses, "Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, 'The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.' This is My name forever, and this is My memorial-name to all generations.
Exodus	Exo	2	3	16	"Go and gather the elders of Israel together and say to them, 'The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, "I am indeed concerned about you and what has been done to you in Egypt.
Exodus	Exo	2	3	17	"So I said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite, to a land flowing with milk and honey."'
Exodus	Exo	2	3	18	"They will pay heed to what you say; and you with the elders of Israel will come to the king of Egypt and you will say to him, 'The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. So now, please, let us go a three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.'
Exodus	Exo	2	3	19	"But I know that the king of Egypt will not permit you to go, except under compulsion.
Exodus	Exo	2	3	20	"So I will stretch out My hand and strike Egypt with all My miracles which I shall do in the midst of it; and after that he will let you go.
Exodus	Exo	2	3	21	"I will grant this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians; and it shall be that when you go, you will not go empty-handed.
Exodus	Exo	2	3	22	"But every woman shall ask of her neighbor and the woman who lives in her house, articles of silver and articles of gold, and clothing; and you will put them on your sons and daughters. Thus you will plunder the Egyptians."
Exodus	Exo	2	4	1	Then Moses said, "What if they will not believe me or listen to what I say? For they may say, 'The LORD has not appeared to you.'"
Exodus	Exo	2	4	2	The LORD said to him, "What is that in your hand?" And he said, "A staff."
Exodus	Exo	2	4	3	Then He said, "Throw it on the ground." So he threw it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from it.
Exodus	Exo	2	4	4	But the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand and grasp it by its tail"--so he stretched out his hand and caught it, and it became a staff in his hand--
Exodus	Exo	2	4	5	"that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you."
Exodus	Exo	2	4	6	The LORD furthermore said to him, "Now put your hand into your bosom." So he put his hand into his bosom, and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous like snow.
Exodus	Exo	2	4	7	Then He said, "Put your hand into your bosom again." So he put his hand into his bosom again, and when he took it out of his bosom, behold, it was restored like the rest of his flesh.
Exodus	Exo	2	4	8	"If they will not believe you or heed the witness of the first sign, they may believe the witness of the last sign.
Exodus	Exo	2	4	9	"But if they will not believe even these two signs or heed what you say, then you shall take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground; and the water which you take from the Nile will become blood on the dry ground."
Exodus	Exo	2	4	10	Then Moses said to the LORD, "Please, Lord, I have never been eloquent, neither recently nor in time past, nor since You have spoken to Your servant; for I am slow of speech and slow of tongue."
Exodus	Exo	2	4	11	The LORD said to him, "Who has made man's mouth? Or who makes him mute or deaf, or seeing or blind? Is it not I, the LORD?
Exodus	Exo	2	4	12	"Now then go, and I, even I, will be with your mouth, and teach you what you are to say."
Exodus	Exo	2	4	13	But he said, "Please, Lord, now send the message by whomever You will."
Exodus	Exo	2	4	14	Then the anger of the LORD burned against Moses, and He said, "Is there not your brother Aaron the Levite? I know that he speaks fluently. And moreover, behold, he is coming out to meet you; when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.
Exodus	Exo	2	4	15	"You are to speak to him and put the words in his mouth; and I, even I, will be with your mouth and his mouth, and I will teach you what you are to do.
Exodus	Exo	2	4	16	"Moreover, he shall speak for you to the people; and he will be as a mouth for you and you will be as God to him.
Exodus	Exo	2	4	17	"You shall take in your hand this staff, with which you shall perform the signs."
Exodus	Exo	2	4	18	Then Moses departed and returned to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, "Please, let me go, that I may return to my brethren who are in Egypt, and see if they are still alive." And Jethro said to Moses, "Go in peace."
Exodus	Exo	2	4	19	Now the LORD said to Moses in Midian, "Go back to Egypt, for all the men who were seeking your life are dead."
Exodus	Exo	2	4	20	So Moses took his wife and his sons and mounted them on a donkey, and returned to the land of Egypt. Moses also took the staff of God in his hand.
Exodus	Exo	2	4	21	The LORD said to Moses, "When you go back to Egypt see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in your power; but I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go.
Exodus	Exo	2	4	22	"Then you shall say to Pharaoh, 'Thus says the LORD, "Israel is My son, My firstborn.
Exodus	Exo	2	4	23	"So I said to you, 'Let My son go that he may serve Me'; but you have refused to let him go. Behold, I will kill your son, your firstborn."'"
Exodus	Exo	2	4	24	Now it came about at the lodging place on the way that the LORD met him and sought to put him to death.
Exodus	Exo	2	4	25	Then Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son's foreskin and threw it at Moses' feet, and she said, "You are indeed a bridegroom of blood to me."
Exodus	Exo	2	4	26	So He let him alone. At that time she said, "You are a bridegroom of blood"--because of the circumcision.
Exodus	Exo	2	4	27	Now the LORD said to Aaron, "Go to meet Moses in the wilderness." So he went and met him at the mountain of God and kissed him.
Exodus	Exo	2	4	28	Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD with which He had sent him, and all the signs that He had commanded him to do.
Exodus	Exo	2	4	29	Then Moses and Aaron went and assembled all the elders of the sons of Israel;
Exodus	Exo	2	4	30	and Aaron spoke all the words which the LORD had spoken to Moses. He then performed the signs in the sight of the people.
Exodus	Exo	2	4	31	So the people believed; and when they heard that the LORD was concerned about the sons of Israel and that He had seen their affliction, then they bowed low and worshiped.
Exodus	Exo	2	5	1	And afterward Moses and Aaron came and said to Pharaoh, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Let My people go that they may celebrate a feast to Me in the wilderness.'"
Exodus	Exo	2	5	2	But Pharaoh said, "Who is the LORD that I should obey His voice to let Israel go? I do not know the LORD, and besides, I will not let Israel go."
Exodus	Exo	2	5	3	Then they said, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please, let us go a three days' journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God, otherwise He will fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword."
Exodus	Exo	2	5	4	But the king of Egypt said to them, "Moses and Aaron, why do you draw the people away from their work? Get back to your labors!"
Exodus	Exo	2	5	5	Again Pharaoh said, "Look, the people of the land are now many, and you would have them cease from their labors!"
Exodus	Exo	2	5	6	So the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters over the people and their foremen, saying,
Exodus	Exo	2	5	7	"You are no longer to give the people straw to make brick as previously; let them go and gather straw for themselves.
Exodus	Exo	2	5	8	"But the quota of bricks which they were making previously, you shall impose on them; you are not to reduce any of it. Because they are lazy, therefore they cry out, 'Let us go and sacrifice to our God.'
Exodus	Exo	2	5	9	"Let the labor be heavier on the men, and let them work at it so that they will pay no attention to false words."
Exodus	Exo	2	5	10	So the taskmasters of the people and their foremen went out and spoke to the people, saying, "Thus says Pharaoh, 'I am not going to give you any straw.
Exodus	Exo	2	5	11	'You go and get straw for yourselves wherever you can find it, but none of your labor will be reduced.'"
Exodus	Exo	2	5	12	So the people scattered through all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.
Exodus	Exo	2	5	13	The taskmasters pressed them, saying, "Complete your work quota, your daily amount, just as when you had straw."
Exodus	Exo	2	5	14	Moreover, the foremen of the sons of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten and were asked, "Why have you not completed your required amount either yesterday or today in making brick as previously?"
Exodus	Exo	2	5	15	Then the foremen of the sons of Israel came and cried out to Pharaoh, saying, "Why do you deal this way with your servants?
Exodus	Exo	2	5	16	"There is no straw given to your servants, yet they keep saying to us, 'Make bricks!' And behold, your servants are being beaten; but it is the fault of your own people."
Exodus	Exo	2	5	17	But he said, "You are lazy, very lazy; therefore you say, 'Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.'
Exodus	Exo	2	5	18	"So go now and work; for you will be given no straw, yet you must deliver the quota of bricks."
Exodus	Exo	2	5	19	The foremen of the sons of Israel saw that they were in trouble because they were told, "You must not reduce your daily amount of bricks."
Exodus	Exo	2	5	20	When they left Pharaoh's presence, they met Moses and Aaron as they were waiting for them.
Exodus	Exo	2	5	21	They said to them, "May the LORD look upon you and judge you, for you have made us odious in Pharaoh's sight and in the sight of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to kill us."
Exodus	Exo	2	5	22	Then Moses returned to the LORD and said, "O Lord, why have You brought harm to this people? Why did You ever send me?
Exodus	Exo	2	5	23	"Ever since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has done harm to this people, and You have not delivered Your people at all."
Exodus	Exo	2	6	1	Then the LORD said to Moses, "Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh; for under compulsion he will let them go, and under compulsion he will drive them out of his land."
Exodus	Exo	2	6	2	God spoke further to Moses and said to him, "I am the LORD;
Exodus	Exo	2	6	3	and I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as God Almighty, but by My name, LORD, I did not make Myself known to them.
Exodus	Exo	2	6	4	"I also established My covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land in which they sojourned.
Exodus	Exo	2	6	5	"Furthermore I have heard the groaning of the sons of Israel, because the Egyptians are holding them in bondage, and I have remembered My covenant.
Exodus	Exo	2	6	6	"Say, therefore, to the sons of Israel, 'I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from their bondage. I will also redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments.
Exodus	Exo	2	6	7	'Then I will take you for My people, and I will be your God; and you shall know that I am the LORD your God, who brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.
Exodus	Exo	2	6	8	'I will bring you to the land which I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and I will give it to you for a possession; I am the LORD.'"
Exodus	Exo	2	6	9	So Moses spoke thus to the sons of Israel, but they did not listen to Moses on account of their despondency and cruel bondage.
Exodus	Exo	2	6	10	Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Exodus	Exo	2	6	11	"Go, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the sons of Israel go out of his land."
Exodus	Exo	2	6	12	But Moses spoke before the LORD, saying, "Behold, the sons of Israel have not listened to me; how then will Pharaoh listen to me, for I am unskilled in speech?"
Exodus	Exo	2	6	13	Then the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and gave them a charge to the sons of Israel and to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
Exodus	Exo	2	6	14	These are the heads of their fathers' households. The sons of Reuben, Israel's firstborn: Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben.

Exodus	Exo	2	6	25	Aaron's son Eleazar married one of the daughters of Putiel, and she bore him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers' households of the Levites according to their families.
Exodus	Exo	2	6	26	It was the same Aaron and Moses to whom the LORD said, "Bring out the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their hosts."
Exodus	Exo	2	6	27	They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing out the sons of Israel from Egypt; it was the same Moses and Aaron.
Exodus	Exo	2	6	28	Now it came about on the day when the LORD spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,
Exodus	Exo	2	6	29	that the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, "I am the LORD; speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak to you."
Exodus	Exo	2	6	30	But Moses said before the LORD, "Behold, I am unskilled in speech; how then will Pharaoh listen to me?"
Exodus	Exo	2	7	1	Then the LORD said to Moses, "See, I make you as God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron shall be your prophet.
Exodus	Exo	2	7	2	"You shall speak all that I command you, and your brother Aaron shall speak to Pharaoh that he let the sons of Israel go out of his land.
Exodus	Exo	2	7	3	"But I will harden Pharaoh's heart that I may multiply My signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt.
Exodus	Exo	2	7	4	"When Pharaoh does not listen to you, then I will lay My hand on Egypt and bring out My hosts, My people the sons of Israel, from the land of Egypt by great judgments.
Exodus	Exo	2	7	5	"The Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch out My hand on Egypt and bring out the sons of Israel from their midst."
Exodus	Exo	2	7	6	So Moses and Aaron did it; as the LORD commanded them, thus they did.
Exodus	Exo	2	7	7	Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three, when they spoke to Pharaoh.
Exodus	Exo	2	7	8	Now the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
Exodus	Exo	2	7	9	"When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, 'Work a miracle,' then you shall say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh, that it may become a serpent.'"
Exodus	Exo	2	7	10	So Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh, and thus they did just as the LORD had commanded; and Aaron threw his staff down before Pharaoh and his servants, and it became a serpent.
Exodus	Exo	2	7	11	Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers, and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did the same with their secret arts.
Exodus	Exo	2	7	12	For each one threw down his staff and they turned into serpents. But Aaron's staff swallowed up their staffs.
Exodus	Exo	2	7	13	Yet Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them, as the LORD had said.
Exodus	Exo	2	7	14	Then the LORD said to Moses, "Pharaoh's heart is stubborn; he refuses to let the people go.
Exodus	Exo	2	7	15	"Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he is going out to the water, and station yourself to meet him on the bank of the Nile; and you shall take in your hand the staff that was turned into a serpent.
Exodus	Exo	2	7	16	"You shall say to him, 'The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, sent me to you, saying, "Let My people go, that they may serve Me in the wilderness. But behold, you have not listened until now."
Exodus	Exo	2	7	17	'Thus says the LORD, "By this you shall know that I am the LORD: behold, I will strike the water that is in the Nile with the staff that is in my hand, and it will be turned to blood.
Exodus	Exo	2	7	18	"The fish that are in the Nile will die, and the Nile will become foul, and the Egyptians will find difficulty in drinking water from the Nile."'"
Exodus	Exo	2	7	19	Then the LORD said to Moses, "Say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, over their streams, and over their pools, and over all their reservoirs of water, that they may become blood; and there will be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.'"
Exodus	Exo	2	7	20	So Moses and Aaron did even as the LORD had commanded. And he lifted up the staff and struck the water that was in the Nile, in the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants, and all the water that was in the Nile was turned to blood.
Exodus	Exo	2	7	21	The fish that were in the Nile died, and the Nile became foul, so that the Egyptians could not drink water from the Nile. And the blood was through all the land of Egypt.
Exodus	Exo	2	7	22	But the magicians of Egypt did the same with their secret arts; and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them, as the LORD had said.
Exodus	Exo	2	7	23	Then Pharaoh turned and went into his house with no concern even for this.
Exodus	Exo	2	7	24	So all the Egyptians dug around the Nile for water to drink, for they could not drink of the water of the Nile.
Exodus	Exo	2	7	25	Seven days passed after the LORD had struck the Nile.
Exodus	Exo	2	8	1	Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh and say to him, 'Thus says the LORD, "Let My people go, that they may serve Me.
Exodus	Exo	2	8	2	"But if you refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite your whole territory with frogs.
Exodus	Exo	2	8	3	"The Nile will swarm with frogs, which will come up and go into your house and into your bedroom and on your bed, and into the houses of your servants and on your people, and into your ovens and into your kneading bowls.
Exodus	Exo	2	8	4	"So the frogs will come up on you and your people and all your servants."'"
Exodus	Exo	2	8	5	Then the LORD said to Moses, "Say to Aaron, 'Stretch out your hand with your staff over the rivers, over the streams and over the pools, and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt.'"
Exodus	Exo	2	8	6	So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt.
Exodus	Exo	2	8	7	The magicians did the same with their secret arts, making frogs come up on the land of Egypt.
Exodus	Exo	2	8	8	Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, "Entreat the LORD that He remove the frogs from me and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice to the LORD."
Exodus	Exo	2	8	9	Moses said to Pharaoh, "The honor is yours to tell me: when shall I entreat for you and your servants and your people, that the frogs be destroyed from you and your houses, that they may be left only in the Nile?"
Exodus	Exo	2	8	10	Then he said, "Tomorrow." So he said, "May it be according to your word, that you may know that there is no one like the LORD our God.
Exodus	Exo	2	8	11	"The frogs will depart from you and your houses and your servants and your people; they will be left only in the Nile."
Exodus	Exo	2	8	12	Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried to the LORD concerning the frogs which He had inflicted upon Pharaoh.
Exodus	Exo	2	8	13	The LORD did according to the word of Moses, and the frogs died out of the houses, the courts, and the fields.
Exodus	Exo	2	8	14	So they piled them in heaps, and the land became foul.
Exodus	Exo	2	8	15	But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and did not listen to them, as the LORD had said.
Exodus	Exo	2	8	16	Then the LORD said to Moses, "Say to Aaron, 'Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the earth, that it may become gnats through all the land of Egypt.'"
Exodus	Exo	2	8	17	They did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff, and struck the dust of the earth, and there were gnats on man and beast. All the dust of the earth became gnats through all the land of Egypt.
Exodus	Exo	2	8	18	The magicians tried with their secret arts to bring forth gnats, but they could not; so there were gnats on man and beast.
Exodus	Exo	2	8	19	Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, "This is the finger of God." But Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them, as the LORD had said.
Exodus	Exo	2	8	20	Now the LORD said to Moses, "Rise early in the morning and present yourself before Pharaoh, as he comes out to the water, and say to him, 'Thus says the LORD, "Let My people go, that they may serve Me.
Exodus	Exo	2	8	21	"For if you do not let My people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies on you and on your servants and on your people and into your houses; and the houses of the Egyptians will be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground on which they dwell.
Exodus	Exo	2	8	22	"But on that day I will set apart the land of Goshen, where My people are living, so that no swarms of flies will be there, in order that you may know that I, the LORD, am in the midst of the land.
Exodus	Exo	2	8	23	"I will put a division between My people and your people. Tomorrow this sign will occur."'"
Exodus	Exo	2	8	24	Then the LORD did so. And there came great swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh and the houses of his servants and the land was laid waste because of the swarms of flies in all the land of Egypt.
Exodus	Exo	2	8	25	Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, "Go, sacrifice to your God within the land."
Exodus	Exo	2	8	26	But Moses said, "It is not right to do so, for we will sacrifice to the LORD our God what is an abomination to the Egyptians. If we sacrifice what is an abomination to the Egyptians before their eyes, will they not then stone us?
Exodus	Exo	2	8	27	"We must go a three days' journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the LORD our God as He commands us."
Exodus	Exo	2	8	28	Pharaoh said, "I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only you shall not go very far away. Make supplication for me."
Exodus	Exo	2	8	29	Then Moses said, "Behold, I am going out from you, and I shall make supplication to the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people tomorrow; only do not let Pharaoh deal deceitfully again in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD."
Exodus	Exo	2	8	30	So Moses went out from Pharaoh and made supplication to the LORD.
Exodus	Exo	2	8	31	The LORD did as Moses asked, and removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants and from his people; not one remained.
Exodus	Exo	2	8	32	But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he did not let the people go.
Exodus	Exo	2	9	1	Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh and speak to him, 'Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, "Let My people go, that they may serve Me.
Exodus	Exo	2	9	2	"For if you refuse to let them go and continue to hold them,
Exodus	Exo	2	9	3	behold, the hand of the LORD will come with a very severe pestilence on your livestock which are in the field, on the horses, on the donkeys, on the camels, on the herds, and on the flocks.
Exodus	Exo	2	9	4	"But the LORD will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt, so that nothing will die of all that belongs to the sons of Israel."'"
Exodus	Exo	2	9	5	The LORD set a definite time, saying, "Tomorrow the LORD will do this thing in the land."
Exodus	Exo	2	9	6	So the LORD did this thing on the next day, and all the livestock of Egypt died; but of the livestock of the sons of Israel, not one died.
Exodus	Exo	2	9	7	Pharaoh sent, and behold, there was not even one of the livestock of Israel dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.
Exodus	Exo	2	9	8	Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "Take for yourselves handfuls of soot from a kiln, and let Moses throw it toward the sky in the sight of Pharaoh.
Exodus	Exo	2	9	9	"It will become fine dust over all the land of Egypt, and will become boils breaking out with sores on man and beast through all the land of Egypt."
Exodus	Exo	2	9	10	So they took soot from a kiln, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses threw it toward the sky, and it became boils breaking out with sores on man and beast.
Exodus	Exo	2	9	11	The magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils were on the magicians as well as on all the Egyptians.
Exodus	Exo	2	9	12	And the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not listen to them, just as the LORD had spoken to Moses.
Exodus	Exo	2	9	13	Then the LORD said to Moses, "Rise up early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh and say to him, 'Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, "Let My people go, that they may serve Me.
Exodus	Exo	2	9	14	"For this time I will send all My plagues on you and your servants and your people, so that you may know that there is no one like Me in all the earth.
Exodus	Exo	2	9	15	"For if by now I had put forth My hand and struck you and your people with pestilence, you would then have been cut off from the earth.
Exodus	Exo	2	9	16	"But, indeed, for this reason I have allowed you to remain, in order to show you My power and in order to proclaim My name through all the earth.
Exodus	Exo	2	9	17	"Still you exalt yourself against My people by not letting them go.
Exodus	Exo	2	9	18	"Behold, about this time tomorrow, I will send a very heavy hail, such as has not been seen in Egypt from the day it was founded until now.
Exodus	Exo	2	9	19	"Now therefore send, bring your livestock and whatever you have in the field to safety. Every man and beast that is found in the field and is not brought home, when the hail comes down on them, will die."'"
Exodus	Exo	2	9	20	The one among the servants of Pharaoh who feared the word of the LORD made his servants and his livestock flee into the houses;
Exodus	Exo	2	9	21	but he who paid no regard to the word of the LORD left his servants and his livestock in the field.
Exodus	Exo	2	9	22	Now the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky, that hail may fall on all the land of Egypt, on man and on beast and on every plant of the field, throughout the land of Egypt."
Exodus	Exo	2	9	23	Moses stretched out his staff toward the sky, and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down to the earth. And the LORD rained hail on the land of Egypt.
Exodus	Exo	2	9	24	So there was hail, and fire flashing continually in the midst of the hail, very severe, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.
Exodus	Exo	2	9	25	The hail struck all that was in the field through all the land of Egypt, both man and beast; the hail also struck every plant of the field and shattered every tree of the field.
Exodus	Exo	2	9	26	Only in the land of Goshen, where the sons of Israel were, there was no hail.
Exodus	Exo	2	9	27	Then Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, "I have sinned this time; the LORD is the righteous one, and I and my people are the wicked ones.
Exodus	Exo	2	9	28	"Make supplication to the LORD, for there has been enough of God's thunder and hail; and I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer."
Exodus	Exo	2	9	29	Moses said to him, "As soon as I go out of the city, I will spread out my hands to the LORD; the thunder will cease and there will be hail no longer, that you may know that the earth is the LORD'S.
Exodus	Exo	2	9	30	"But as for you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear the LORD God."
Exodus	Exo	2	9	31	(Now the flax and the barley were ruined, for the barley was in the ear and the flax was in bud.
Exodus	Exo	2	9	32	But the wheat and the spelt were not ruined, for they ripen late.)
Exodus	Exo	2	9	33	So Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread out his hands to the LORD; and the thunder and the hail ceased, and rain no longer poured on the earth.
Exodus	Exo	2	9	34	But when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had ceased, he sinned again and hardened his heart, he and his servants.
Exodus	Exo	2	9	35	Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not let the sons of Israel go, just as the LORD had spoken through Moses.
Exodus	Exo	2	10	1	Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants, that I may perform these signs of Mine among them,
Exodus	Exo	2	10	2	and that you may tell in the hearing of your son, and of your grandson, how I made a mockery of the Egyptians and how I performed My signs among them, that you may know that I am the LORD."
Exodus	Exo	2	10	3	Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him, "Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, 'How long will you refuse to humble yourself before Me? Let My people go, that they may serve Me.
Exodus	Exo	2	10	4	'For if you refuse to let My people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your territory.
Exodus	Exo	2	10	5	'They shall cover the surface of the land, so that no one will be able to see the land. They will also eat the rest of what has escaped--what is left to you from the hail--and they will eat every tree which sprouts for you out of the field.
Exodus	Exo	2	10	6	'Then your houses shall be filled and the houses of all your servants and the houses of all the Egyptians, something which neither your fathers nor your grandfathers have seen, from the day that they came upon the earth until this day.'" And he turned and went out from Pharaoh.
Exodus	Exo	2	10	7	Pharaoh's servants said to him, "How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God. Do you not realize that Egypt is destroyed?"
Exodus	Exo	2	10	8	So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh, and he said to them, "Go, serve the LORD your God! Who are the ones that are going?"
Exodus	Exo	2	10	9	Moses said, "We shall go with our young and our old; with our sons and our daughters, with our flocks and our herds we shall go, for we must hold a feast to the LORD."
Exodus	Exo	2	10	10	Then he said to them, "Thus may the LORD be with you, if ever I let you and your little ones go! Take heed, for evil is in your mind.
Exodus	Exo	2	10	11	"Not so! Go now, the men among you, and serve the LORD, for that is what you desire." So they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.
Exodus	Exo	2	10	12	Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up on the land of Egypt and eat every plant of the land, even all that the hail has left."
Exodus	Exo	2	10	13	So Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and the LORD directed an east wind on the land all that day and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.
Exodus	Exo	2	10	14	The locusts came up over all the land of Egypt and settled in all the territory of Egypt; they were very numerous. There had never been so many locusts, nor would there be so many again.
Exodus	Exo	2	10	15	For they covered the surface of the whole land, so that the land was darkened; and they ate every plant of the land and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left. Thus nothing green was left on tree or plant of the field through all the land of Egypt.
Exodus	Exo	2	10	16	Then Pharaoh hurriedly called for Moses and Aaron, and he said, "I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you.
Exodus	Exo	2	10	17	"Now therefore, please forgive my sin only this once, and make supplication to the LORD your God, that He would only remove this death from me."
Exodus	Exo	2	10	18	He went out from Pharaoh and made supplication to the LORD.
Exodus	Exo	2	10	19	So the LORD shifted the wind to a very strong west wind which took up the locusts and drove them into the Red Sea; not one locust was left in all the territory of Egypt.
Exodus	Exo	2	10	20	But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the sons of Israel go.
Exodus	Exo	2	10	21	Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even a darkness which may be felt."
Exodus	Exo	2	10	22	So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and there was thick darkness in all the land of Egypt for three days.
Exodus	Exo	2	10	23	They did not see one another, nor did anyone rise from his place for three days, but all the sons of Israel had light in their dwellings.
Exodus	Exo	2	10	24	Then Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, "Go, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be detained. Even your little ones may go with you."
Exodus	Exo	2	10	25	But Moses said, "You must also let us have sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice them to the LORD our God.
Exodus	Exo	2	10	26	"Therefore, our livestock too shall go with us; not a hoof shall be left behind, for we shall take some of them to serve the LORD our God. And until we arrive there, we ourselves do not know with what we shall serve the LORD."
Exodus	Exo	2	10	27	But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he was not willing to let them go.
Exodus	Exo	2	10	28	Then Pharaoh said to him, "Get away from me! Beware, do not see my face again, for in the day you see my face you shall die!"
Exodus	Exo	2	10	29	Moses said, "You are right; I shall never see your face again!"
Exodus	Exo	2	11	1	Now the LORD said to Moses, "One more plague I will bring on Pharaoh and on Egypt; after that he will let you go from here. When he lets you go, he will surely drive you out from here completely.
Exodus	Exo	2	11	2	"Speak now in the hearing of the people that each man ask from his neighbor and each woman from her neighbor for articles of silver and articles of gold."
Exodus	Exo	2	11	3	The LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Furthermore, the man Moses himself was greatly esteemed in the land of Egypt, both in the sight of Pharaoh's servants and in the sight of the people.
Exodus	Exo	2	11	4	Moses said, "Thus says the LORD, 'About midnight I am going out into the midst of Egypt,
Exodus	Exo	2	11	5	and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of the Pharaoh who sits on his throne, even to the firstborn of the slave girl who is behind the millstones; all the firstborn of the cattle as well.
Exodus	Exo	2	11	6	'Moreover, there shall be a great cry in all the land of Egypt, such as there has not been before and such as shall never be again.
Exodus	Exo	2	11	7	'But against any of the sons of Israel a dog will not even bark, whether against man or beast, that you may understand how the LORD makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel.'
Exodus	Exo	2	11	8	"All these your servants will come down to me and bow themselves before me, saying, 'Go out, you and all the people who follow you,' and after that I will go out." And he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.
Exodus	Exo	2	11	9	Then the LORD said to Moses, "Pharaoh will not listen to you, so that My wonders will be multiplied in the land of Egypt."
Exodus	Exo	2	11	10	Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders before Pharaoh; yet the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the sons of Israel go out of his land.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	1	Now the LORD said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt,
Exodus	Exo	2	12	2	"This month shall be the beginning of months for you; it is to be the first month of the year to you.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	3	"Speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying, 'On the tenth of this month they are each one to take a lamb for themselves, according to their fathers' households, a lamb for each household.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	4	'Now if the household is too small for a lamb, then he and his neighbor nearest to his house are to take one according to the number of persons in them; according to what each man should eat, you are to divide the lamb.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	5	'Your lamb shall be an unblemished male a year old; you may take it from the sheep or from the goats.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	6	'You shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month, then the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel is to kill it at twilight.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	7	'Moreover, they shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel of the houses in which they eat it.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	8	'They shall eat the flesh that same night, roasted with fire, and they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	9	'Do not eat any of it raw or boiled at all with water, but rather roasted with fire, both its head and its legs along with its entrails.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	10	'And you shall not leave any of it over until morning, but whatever is left of it until morning, you shall burn with fire.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	11	'Now you shall eat it in this manner: with your loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it in haste--it is the LORD'S Passover.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	12	'For I will go through the land of Egypt on that night, and will strike down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments--I am the LORD.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	13	'The blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you live; and when I see the blood I will pass over you, and no plague will befall you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	14	'Now this day will be a memorial to you, and you shall celebrate it as a feast to the LORD; throughout your generations you are to celebrate it as a permanent ordinance.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	15	'Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, but on the first day you shall remove leaven from your houses; for whoever eats anything leavened from the first day until the seventh day, that person shall be cut off from Israel.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	16	'On the first day you shall have a holy assembly, and another holy assembly on the seventh day; no work at all shall be done on them, except what must be eaten by every person, that alone may be prepared by you.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	17	'You shall also observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread, for on this very day I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt; therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations as a permanent ordinance.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	18	'In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you shall eat unleavened bread, until the twenty-first day of the month at evening.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	19	'Seven days there shall be no leaven found in your houses; for whoever eats what is leavened, that person shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he is an alien or a native of the land.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	20	'You shall not eat anything leavened; in all your dwellings you shall eat unleavened bread.'"
Exodus	Exo	2	12	21	Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel and said to them, "Go and take for yourselves lambs according to your families, and slay the Passover lamb.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	22	"You shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood which is in the basin, and apply some of the blood that is in the basin to the lintel and the two doorposts; and none of you shall go outside the door of his house until morning.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	23	"For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when He sees the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts, the LORD will pass over the door and will not allow the destroyer to come in to your houses to smite you.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	24	"And you shall observe this event as an ordinance for you and your children forever.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	25	"When you enter the land which the LORD will give you, as He has promised, you shall observe this rite.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	26	"And when your children say to you, 'What does this rite mean to you?'
Exodus	Exo	2	12	27	you shall say, 'It is a Passover sacrifice to the LORD who passed over the houses of the sons of Israel in Egypt when He smote the Egyptians, but spared our homes.'" And the people bowed low and worshiped.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	28	Then the sons of Israel went and did so; just as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	29	Now it came about at midnight that the LORD struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of cattle.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	30	Pharaoh arose in the night, he and all his servants and all the Egyptians, and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was no home where there was not someone dead.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	31	Then he called for Moses and Aaron at night and said, "Rise up, get out from among my people, both you and the sons of Israel; and go, worship the LORD, as you have said.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	32	"Take both your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and go, and bless me also."
Exodus	Exo	2	12	33	The Egyptians urged the people, to send them out of the land in haste, for they said, "We will all be dead."
Exodus	Exo	2	12	34	So the people took their dough before it was leavened, with their kneading bowls bound up in the clothes on their shoulders.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	35	Now the sons of Israel had done according to the word of Moses, for they had requested from the Egyptians articles of silver and articles of gold, and clothing;
Exodus	Exo	2	12	36	and the LORD had given the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have their request. Thus they plundered the Egyptians.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	37	Now the sons of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, aside from children.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	38	A mixed multitude also went up with them, along with flocks and herds, a very large number of livestock.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	39	They baked the dough which they had brought out of Egypt into cakes of unleavened bread. For it had not become leavened, since they were driven out of Egypt and could not delay, nor had they prepared any provisions for themselves.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	40	Now the time that the sons of Israel lived in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	41	And at the end of four hundred and thirty years, to the very day, all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	42	It is a night to be observed for the LORD for having brought them out from the land of Egypt; this night is for the LORD, to be observed by all the sons of Israel throughout their generations.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	43	The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "This is the ordinance of the Passover: no foreigner is to eat of it;
Exodus	Exo	2	12	44	but every man's slave purchased with money, after you have circumcised him, then he may eat of it.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	45	"A sojourner or a hired servant shall not eat of it.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	46	"It is to be eaten in a single house; you are not to bring forth any of the flesh outside of the house, nor are you to break any bone of it.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	47	"All the congregation of Israel are to celebrate this.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	48	"But if a stranger sojourns with you, and celebrates the Passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near to celebrate it; and he shall be like a native of the land. But no uncircumcised person may eat of it.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	49	"The same law shall apply to the native as to the stranger who sojourns among you."
Exodus	Exo	2	12	50	Then all the sons of Israel did so; they did just as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron.
Exodus	Exo	2	12	51	And on that same day the LORD brought the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their hosts.
Exodus	Exo	2	13	1	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Exodus	Exo	2	13	2	"Sanctify to Me every firstborn, the first offspring of every womb among the sons of Israel, both of man and beast; it belongs to Me."
Exodus	Exo	2	13	3	Moses said to the people, "Remember this day in which you went out from Egypt, from the house of slavery; for by a powerful hand the LORD brought you out from this place. And nothing leavened shall be eaten.
Exodus	Exo	2	13	4	"On this day in the month of Abib, you are about to go forth.
Exodus	Exo	2	13	5	"It shall be when the LORD brings you to the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Hivite and the Jebusite, which He swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, that you shall observe this rite in this month.
Exodus	Exo	2	13	6	"For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a feast to the LORD.
Exodus	Exo	2	13	7	"Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days; and nothing leavened shall be seen among you, nor shall any leaven be seen among you in all your borders.
Exodus	Exo	2	13	8	"You shall tell your son on that day, saying, 'It is because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.'
Exodus	Exo	2	13	9	"And it shall serve as a sign to you on your hand, and as a reminder on your forehead, that the law of the LORD may be in your mouth; for with a powerful hand the LORD brought you out of Egypt.
Exodus	Exo	2	13	10	"Therefore, you shall keep this ordinance at its appointed time from year to year.
Exodus	Exo	2	13	11	"Now when the LORD brings you to the land of the Canaanite, as He swore to you and to your fathers, and gives it to you,
Exodus	Exo	2	13	12	you shall devote to the LORD the first offspring of every womb, and the first offspring of every beast that you own; the males belong to the LORD.
Exodus	Exo	2	13	13	"But every first offspring of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb, but if you do not redeem it, then you shall break its neck; and every firstborn of man among your sons you shall redeem.
Exodus	Exo	2	13	14	"And it shall be when your son asks you in time to come, saying, 'What is this?' then you shall say to him, 'With a powerful hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, from the house of slavery.
Exodus	Exo	2	13	15	'It came about, when Pharaoh was stubborn about letting us go, that the LORD killed every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of beast. Therefore, I sacrifice to the LORD the males, the first offspring of every womb, but every firstborn of my sons I redeem.'
Exodus	Exo	2	13	16	"So it shall serve as a sign on your hand and as phylacteries on your forehead, for with a powerful hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt."
Exodus	Exo	2	13	17	Now when Pharaoh had let the people go, God did not lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines, even though it was near; for God said, "The people might change their minds when they see war, and return to Egypt."
Exodus	Exo	2	13	18	Hence God led the people around by the way of the wilderness to the Red Sea; and the sons of Israel went up in martial array from the land of Egypt.
Exodus	Exo	2	13	19	Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for he had made the sons of Israel solemnly swear, saying, "God will surely take care of you, and you shall carry my bones from here with you."
Exodus	Exo	2	13	20	Then they set out from Succoth and camped in Etham on the edge of the wilderness.
Exodus	Exo	2	13	21	The LORD was going before them in a pillar of cloud by day to lead them on the way, and in a pillar of fire by night to give them light, that they might travel by day and by night.
Exodus	Exo	2	13	22	He did not take away the pillar of cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people.
Exodus	Exo	2	14	1	Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Exodus	Exo	2	14	2	"Tell the sons of Israel to turn back and camp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea; you shall camp in front of Baal-zephon, opposite it, by the sea.
Exodus	Exo	2	14	3	"For Pharaoh will say of the sons of Israel, 'They are wandering aimlessly in the land; the wilderness has shut them in.'
Exodus	Exo	2	14	4	"Thus I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will chase after them; and I will be honored through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD." And they did so.
Exodus	Exo	2	14	5	When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his servants had a change of heart toward the people, and they said, "What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?"
Exodus	Exo	2	14	6	So he made his chariot ready and took his people with him;
Exodus	Exo	2	14	7	and he took six hundred select chariots, and all the other chariots of Egypt with officers over all of them.
Exodus	Exo	2	14	8	The LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he chased after the sons of Israel as the sons of Israel were going out boldly.
Exodus	Exo	2	14	9	Then the Egyptians chased after them with all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, his horsemen and his army, and they overtook them camping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, in front of Baal-zephon.
Exodus	Exo	2	14	10	As Pharaoh drew near, the sons of Israel looked, and behold, the Egyptians were marching after them, and they became very frightened; so the sons of Israel cried out to the LORD.
Exodus	Exo	2	14	11	Then they said to Moses, "Is it because there were no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you dealt with us in this way, bringing us out of Egypt?
Exodus	Exo	2	14	12	"Is this not the word that we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, 'Leave us alone that we may serve the Egyptians'? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness."
Exodus	Exo	2	14	13	But Moses said to the people, "Do not fear! Stand by and see the salvation of the LORD which He will accomplish for you today; for the Egyptians whom you have seen today, you will never see them again forever.
Exodus	Exo	2	14	14	"The LORD will fight for you while you keep silent."
Exodus	Exo	2	14	15	Then the LORD said to Moses, "Why are you crying out to Me? Tell the sons of Israel to go forward.
Exodus	Exo	2	14	16	"As for you, lift up your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, and the sons of Israel shall go through the midst of the sea on dry land.
Exodus	Exo	2	14	17	"As for Me, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them; and I will be honored through Pharaoh and all his army, through his chariots and his horsemen.
Exodus	Exo	2	14	18	"Then the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD, when I am honored through Pharaoh, through his chariots and his horsemen."
Exodus	Exo	2	14	19	The angel of God, who had been going before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them and stood behind them.
Exodus	Exo	2	14	20	So it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel; and there was the cloud along with the darkness, yet it gave light at night. Thus the one did not come near the other all night.
Exodus	Exo	2	14	21	Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD swept the sea back by a strong east wind all night and turned the sea into dry land, so the waters were divided.
Exodus	Exo	2	14	22	The sons of Israel went through the midst of the sea on the dry land, and the waters were like a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.
Exodus	Exo	2	14	23	Then the Egyptians took up the pursuit, and all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots and his horsemen went in after them into the midst of the sea.
Exodus	Exo	2	14	24	At the morning watch, the LORD looked down on the army of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and cloud and brought the army of the Egyptians into confusion.
Exodus	Exo	2	14	25	He caused their chariot wheels to swerve, and He made them drive with difficulty; so the Egyptians said, "Let us flee from Israel, for the LORD is fighting for them against the Egyptians."
Exodus	Exo	2	14	26	Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters may come back over the Egyptians, over their chariots and their horsemen."
Exodus	Exo	2	14	27	So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its normal state at daybreak, while the Egyptians were fleeing right into it; then the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.
Exodus	Exo	2	14	28	The waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen, even Pharaoh's entire army that had gone into the sea after them; not even one of them remained.
Exodus	Exo	2	14	29	But the sons of Israel walked on dry land through the midst of the sea, and the waters were like a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.
Exodus	Exo	2	14	30	Thus the LORD saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.
Exodus	Exo	2	14	31	When Israel saw the great power which the LORD had used against the Egyptians, the people feared the LORD, and they believed in the LORD and in His servant Moses.
Exodus	Exo	2	15	1	Then Moses and the sons of Israel sang this song to the LORD, and said, "I will sing to the LORD, for He is highly exalted; The horse and its rider He has hurled into the sea.
Exodus	Exo	2	15	2	"The LORD is my strength and song, And He has become my salvation; This is my God, and I will praise Him; My father's God, and I will extol Him.
Exodus	Exo	2	15	3	"The LORD is a warrior; The LORD is His name.
Exodus	Exo	2	15	4	"Pharaoh's chariots and his army He has cast into the sea; And the choicest of his officers are drowned in the Red Sea.
Exodus	Exo	2	15	5	"The deeps cover them; They went down into the depths like a stone.
Exodus	Exo	2	15	6	"Your right hand, O LORD, is majestic in power, Your right hand, O LORD, shatters the enemy.
Exodus	Exo	2	15	7	"And in the greatness of Your excellence You overthrow those who rise up against You; You send forth Your burning anger, and it consumes them as chaff.
Exodus	Exo	2	15	8	"At the blast of Your nostrils the waters were piled up, The flowing waters stood up like a heap; The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea.
Exodus	Exo	2	15	9	"The enemy said, 'I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; My desire shall be gratified against them; I will draw out my sword, my hand will destroy them.'
Exodus	Exo	2	15	10	"You blew with Your wind, the sea covered them; They sank like lead in the mighty waters.
Exodus	Exo	2	15	11	"Who is like You among the gods, O LORD? Who is like You, majestic in holiness, Awesome in praises, working wonders?
Exodus	Exo	2	15	12	"You stretched out Your right hand, The earth swallowed them.
Exodus	Exo	2	15	13	"In Your lovingkindness You have led the people whom You have redeemed; In Your strength You have guided them to Your holy habitation.
Exodus	Exo	2	15	14	"The peoples have heard, they tremble; Anguish has gripped the inhabitants of Philistia.
Exodus	Exo	2	15	15	"Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed; The leaders of Moab, trembling grips them; All the inhabitants of Canaan have melted away.
Exodus	Exo	2	15	16	"Terror and dread fall upon them; By the greatness of Your arm they are motionless as stone; Until Your people pass over, O LORD, Until the people pass over whom You have purchased.
Exodus	Exo	2	15	17	"You will bring them and plant them in the mountain of Your inheritance, The place, O LORD, which You have made for Your dwelling, The sanctuary, O Lord, which Your hands have established.
Exodus	Exo	2	15	18	"The LORD shall reign forever and ever."
Exodus	Exo	2	15	19	For the horses of Pharaoh with his chariots and his horsemen went into the sea, and the LORD brought back the waters of the sea on them, but the sons of Israel walked on dry land through the midst of the sea.
Exodus	Exo	2	15	20	Miriam the prophetess, Aaron's sister, took the timbrel in her hand, and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dancing.
Exodus	Exo	2	15	21	Miriam answered them, "Sing to the LORD, for He is highly exalted; The horse and his rider He has hurled into the sea."
Exodus	Exo	2	15	22	Then Moses led Israel from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness and found no water.
Exodus	Exo	2	15	23	When they came to Marah, they could not drink the waters of Marah, for they were bitter; therefore it was named Marah.
Exodus	Exo	2	15	24	So the people grumbled at Moses, saying, "What shall we drink?"
Exodus	Exo	2	15	25	Then he cried out to the LORD, and the LORD showed him a tree; and he threw it into the waters, and the waters became sweet. There He made for them a statute and regulation, and there He tested them.
Exodus	Exo	2	15	26	And He said, "If you will give earnest heed to the voice of the LORD your God, and do what is right in His sight, and give ear to His commandments, and keep all His statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you which I have put on the Egyptians; for I, the LORD, am your healer."
Exodus	Exo	2	15	27	Then they came to Elim where there were twelve springs of water and seventy date palms, and they camped there beside the waters.
Exodus	Exo	2	16	1	Then they set out from Elim, and all the congregation of the sons of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departure from the land of Egypt.
Exodus	Exo	2	16	2	The whole congregation of the sons of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.
Exodus	Exo	2	16	3	The sons of Israel said to them, "Would that we had died by the LORD'S hand in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the pots of meat, when we ate bread to the full; for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger."
Exodus	Exo	2	16	4	Then the LORD said to Moses, "Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion every day, that I may test them, whether or not they will walk in My instruction.
Exodus	Exo	2	16	5	"On the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather daily."
Exodus	Exo	2	16	6	So Moses and Aaron said to all the sons of Israel, "At evening you will know that the LORD has brought you out of the land of Egypt;
Exodus	Exo	2	16	7	and in the morning you will see the glory of the LORD, for He hears your grumblings against the LORD; and what are we, that you grumble against us?"
Exodus	Exo	2	16	8	Moses said, "This will happen when the LORD gives you meat to eat in the evening, and bread to the full in the morning; for the LORD hears your grumblings which you grumble against Him. And what are we? Your grumblings are not against us but against the LORD."
Exodus	Exo	2	16	9	Then Moses said to Aaron, "Say to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, 'Come near before the LORD, for He has heard your grumblings.'"
Exodus	Exo	2	16	10	It came about as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the sons of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.
Exodus	Exo	2	16	11	And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Exodus	Exo	2	16	12	"I have heard the grumblings of the sons of Israel; speak to them, saying, 'At twilight you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread; and you shall know that I am the LORD your God.'"
Exodus	Exo	2	16	13	So it came about at evening that the quails came up and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp.
Exodus	Exo	2	16	14	When the layer of dew evaporated, behold, on the surface of the wilderness there was a fine flake-like thing, fine as the frost on the ground.
Exodus	Exo	2	16	15	When the sons of Israel saw it, they said to one another, "What is it?" For they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, "It is the bread which the LORD has given you to eat.
Exodus	Exo	2	16	16	"This is what the LORD has commanded, 'Gather of it every man as much as he should eat; you shall take an omer apiece according to the number of persons each of you has in his tent.'"
Exodus	Exo	2	16	17	The sons of Israel did so, and some gathered much and some little.
Exodus	Exo	2	16	18	When they measured it with an omer, he who had gathered much had no excess, and he who had gathered little had no lack; every man gathered as much as he should eat.
Exodus	Exo	2	16	19	Moses said to them, "Let no man leave any of it until morning."
Exodus	Exo	2	16	20	But they did not listen to Moses, and some left part of it until morning, and it bred worms and became foul; and Moses was angry with them.
Exodus	Exo	2	16	21	They gathered it morning by morning, every man as much as he should eat; but when the sun grew hot, it would melt.
Exodus	Exo	2	16	22	Now on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one. When all the leaders of the congregation came and told Moses,
Exodus	Exo	2	16	23	then he said to them, "This is what the LORD meant: Tomorrow is a sabbath observance, a holy sabbath to the LORD. Bake what you will bake and boil what you will boil, and all that is left over put aside to be kept until morning."
Exodus	Exo	2	16	24	So they put it aside until morning, as Moses had ordered, and it did not become foul nor was there any worm in it.
Exodus	Exo	2	16	25	Moses said, "Eat it today, for today is a sabbath to the LORD; today you will not find it in the field.
Exodus	Exo	2	16	26	"Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, the sabbath, there will be none."
Exodus	Exo	2	16	27	It came about on the seventh day that some of the people went out to gather, but they found none.
Exodus	Exo	2	16	28	Then the LORD said to Moses, "How long do you refuse to keep My commandments and My instructions?
Exodus	Exo	2	16	29	"See, the LORD has given you the sabbath; therefore He gives you bread for two days on the sixth day. Remain every man in his place; let no man go out of his place on the seventh day."
Exodus	Exo	2	16	30	So the people rested on the seventh day.
Exodus	Exo	2	16	31	The house of Israel named it manna, and it was like coriander seed, white, and its taste was like wafers with honey.
Exodus	Exo	2	16	32	Then Moses said, "This is what the LORD has commanded, 'Let an omerful of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread that I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.'"
Exodus	Exo	2	16	33	Moses said to Aaron, "Take a jar and put an omerful of manna in it, and place it before the LORD to be kept throughout your generations."
Exodus	Exo	2	16	34	As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it before the Testimony, to be kept.
Exodus	Exo	2	16	35	The sons of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to an inhabited land; they ate the manna until they came to the border of the land of Canaan.
Exodus	Exo	2	16	36	(Now an omer is a tenth of an ephah.)
Exodus	Exo	2	17	1	Then all the congregation of the sons of Israel journeyed by stages from the wilderness of Sin, according to the command of the LORD, and camped at Rephidim, and there was no water for the people to drink.
Exodus	Exo	2	17	2	Therefore the people quarreled with Moses and said, "Give us water that we may drink." And Moses said to them, "Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test the LORD?"
Exodus	Exo	2	17	3	But the people thirsted there for water; and they grumbled against Moses and said, "Why, now, have you brought us up from Egypt, to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?"
Exodus	Exo	2	17	4	So Moses cried out to the LORD, saying, "What shall I do to this people? A little more and they will stone me."
Exodus	Exo	2	17	5	Then the LORD said to Moses, "Pass before the people and take with you some of the elders of Israel; and take in your hand your staff with which you struck the Nile, and go.
Exodus	Exo	2	17	6	"Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock at Horeb; and you shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, that the people may drink." And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.
Exodus	Exo	2	17	7	He named the place Massah and Meribah because of the quarrel of the sons of Israel, and because they tested the LORD, saying, "Is the LORD among us, or not?"
Exodus	Exo	2	17	8	Then Amalek came and fought against Israel at Rephidim.
Exodus	Exo	2	17	9	So Moses said to Joshua, "Choose men for us and go out, fight against Amalek. Tomorrow I will station myself on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand."
Exodus	Exo	2	17	10	Joshua did as Moses told him, and fought against Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
Exodus	Exo	2	17	11	So it came about when Moses held his hand up, that Israel prevailed, and when he let his hand down, Amalek prevailed.
Exodus	Exo	2	17	12	But Moses' hands were heavy. Then they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it; and Aaron and Hur supported his hands, one on one side and one on the other. Thus his hands were steady until the sun set.
Exodus	Exo	2	17	13	So Joshua overwhelmed Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
Exodus	Exo	2	17	14	Then the LORD said to Moses, "Write this in a book as a memorial and recite it to Joshua, that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven."
Exodus	Exo	2	17	15	Moses built an altar and named it The LORD is My Banner;
Exodus	Exo	2	17	16	and he said, "The LORD has sworn; the LORD will have war against Amalek from generation to generation."
Exodus	Exo	2	18	1	Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel His people, how the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt.
Exodus	Exo	2	18	2	Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took Moses' wife Zipporah, after he had sent her away,
Exodus	Exo	2	18	3	and her two sons, of whom one was named Gershom, for Moses said, "I have been a sojourner in a foreign land."
Exodus	Exo	2	18	4	The other was named Eliezer, for he said, "The God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh."
Exodus	Exo	2	18	5	Then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses in the wilderness where he was camped, at the mount of God.
Exodus	Exo	2	18	6	He sent word to Moses, "I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons with her."
Exodus	Exo	2	18	7	Then Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and he bowed down and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare and went into the tent.
Exodus	Exo	2	18	8	Moses told his father-in-law all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, all the hardship that had befallen them on the journey, and how the LORD had delivered them.
Exodus	Exo	2	18	9	Jethro rejoiced over all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, in delivering them from the hand of the Egyptians.
Exodus	Exo	2	18	10	So Jethro said, "Blessed be the LORD who delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of Pharaoh, and who delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.
Exodus	Exo	2	18	11	"Now I know that the LORD is greater than all the gods; indeed, it was proven when they dealt proudly against the people."
Exodus	Exo	2	18	12	Then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat a meal with Moses' father-in-law before God.
Exodus	Exo	2	18	13	It came about the next day that Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood about Moses from the morning until the evening.
Exodus	Exo	2	18	14	Now when Moses' father-in-law saw all that he was doing for the people, he said, "What is this thing that you are doing for the people? Why do you alone sit as judge and all the people stand about you from morning until evening?"
Exodus	Exo	2	18	15	Moses said to his father-in-law, "Because the people come to me to inquire of God.
Exodus	Exo	2	18	16	"When they have a dispute, it comes to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbor and make known the statutes of God and His laws."
Exodus	Exo	2	18	17	Moses' father-in-law said to him, "The thing that you are doing is not good.
Exodus	Exo	2	18	18	"You will surely wear out, both yourself and these people who are with you, for the task is too heavy for you; you cannot do it alone.
Exodus	Exo	2	18	19	"Now listen to me: I will give you counsel, and God be with you. You be the people's representative before God, and you bring the disputes to God,
Exodus	Exo	2	18	20	then teach them the statutes and the laws, and make known to them the way in which they are to walk and the work they are to do.
Exodus	Exo	2	18	21	"Furthermore, you shall select out of all the people able men who fear God, men of truth, those who hate dishonest gain; and you shall place these over them as leaders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties and of tens.
Exodus	Exo	2	18	22	"Let them judge the people at all times; and let it be that every major dispute they will bring to you, but every minor dispute they themselves will judge. So it will be easier for you, and they will bear the burden with you.
Exodus	Exo	2	18	23	"If you do this thing and God so commands you, then you will be able to endure, and all these people also will go to their place in peace."
Exodus	Exo	2	18	24	So Moses listened to his father-in-law and did all that he had said.
Exodus	Exo	2	18	25	Moses chose able men out of all Israel and made them heads over the people, leaders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties and of tens.
Exodus	Exo	2	18	26	They judged the people at all times; the difficult dispute they would bring to Moses, but every minor dispute they themselves would judge.
Exodus	Exo	2	18	27	Then Moses bade his father-in-law farewell, and he went his way into his own land.
Exodus	Exo	2	19	1	In the third month after the sons of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on that very day they came into the wilderness of Sinai.
Exodus	Exo	2	19	2	When they set out from Rephidim, they came to the wilderness of Sinai and camped in the wilderness; and there Israel camped in front of the mountain.
Exodus	Exo	2	19	3	Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain, saying, "Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob and tell the sons of Israel:
Exodus	Exo	2	19	4	'You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings, and brought you to Myself.
Exodus	Exo	2	19	5	'Now then, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be My own possession among all the peoples, for all the earth is Mine;
Exodus	Exo	2	19	6	and you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.' These are the words that you shall speak to the sons of Israel."
Exodus	Exo	2	19	7	So Moses came and called the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which the LORD had commanded him.
Exodus	Exo	2	19	8	All the people answered together and said, "All that the LORD has spoken we will do!" And Moses brought back the words of the people to the LORD.
Exodus	Exo	2	19	9	The LORD said to Moses, "Behold, I will come to you in a thick cloud, so that the people may hear when I speak with you and may also believe in you forever." Then Moses told the words of the people to the LORD.
Exodus	Exo	2	19	10	The LORD also said to Moses, "Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments;
Exodus	Exo	2	19	11	and let them be ready for the third day, for on the third day the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.
Exodus	Exo	2	19	12	"You shall set bounds for the people all around, saying, 'Beware that you do not go up on the mountain or touch the border of it; whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death.
Exodus	Exo	2	19	13	'No hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through; whether beast or man, he shall not live.' When the ram's horn sounds a long blast, they shall come up to the mountain."
Exodus	Exo	2	19	14	So Moses went down from the mountain to the people and consecrated the people, and they washed their garments.
Exodus	Exo	2	19	15	He said to the people, "Be ready for the third day; do not go near a woman."
Exodus	Exo	2	19	16	So it came about on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunder and lightning flashes and a thick cloud upon the mountain and a very loud trumpet sound, so that all the people who were in the camp trembled.
Exodus	Exo	2	19	17	And Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain.
Exodus	Exo	2	19	18	Now Mount Sinai was all in smoke because the LORD descended upon it in fire; and its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked violently.
Exodus	Exo	2	19	19	When the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and God answered him with thunder.
Exodus	Exo	2	19	20	The LORD came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain; and the LORD called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.
Exodus	Exo	2	19	21	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, "Go down, warn the people, so that they do not break through to the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.
Exodus	Exo	2	19	22	"Also let the priests who come near to the LORD consecrate themselves, or else the LORD will break out against them."
Exodus	Exo	2	19	23	Moses said to the LORD, "The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai, for You warned us, saying, 'Set bounds about the mountain and consecrate it.'"
Exodus	Exo	2	19	24	Then the LORD said to him, "Go down and come up again, you and Aaron with you; but do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to the LORD, or He will break forth upon them."
Exodus	Exo	2	19	25	So Moses went down to the people and told them.
Exodus	Exo	2	20	1	Then God spoke all these words, saying,
Exodus	Exo	2	20	2	"I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
Exodus	Exo	2	20	3	"You shall have no other gods before Me.
Exodus	Exo	2	20	4	"You shall not make for yourself an idol, or any likeness of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water under the earth.
Exodus	Exo	2	20	5	"You shall not worship them or serve them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me,
Exodus	Exo	2	20	6	but showing lovingkindness to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments.
Exodus	Exo	2	20	7	"You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not leave him unpunished who takes His name in vain.
Exodus	Exo	2	20	8	"Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.
Exodus	Exo	2	20	9	"Six days you shall labor and do all your work,
Exodus	Exo	2	20	10	but the seventh day is a sabbath of the LORD your God; in it you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter, your male or your female servant or your cattle or your sojourner who stays with you.
Exodus	Exo	2	20	11	"For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day; therefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day and made it holy.
Exodus	Exo	2	20	12	"Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be prolonged in the land which the LORD your God gives you.
Exodus	Exo	2	20	13	"You shall not murder.
Exodus	Exo	2	20	14	"You shall not commit adultery.
Exodus	Exo	2	20	15	"You shall not steal.
Exodus	Exo	2	20	16	"You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
Exodus	Exo	2	20	17	"You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife or his male servant or his female servant or his ox or his donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor."
Exodus	Exo	2	20	18	All the people perceived the thunder and the lightning flashes and the sound of the trumpet and the mountain smoking; and when the people saw it, they trembled and stood at a distance.
Exodus	Exo	2	20	19	Then they said to Moses, "Speak to us yourself and we will listen; but let not God speak to us, or we will die."
Exodus	Exo	2	20	20	Moses said to the people, "Do not be afraid; for God has come in order to test you, and in order that the fear of Him may remain with you, so that you may not sin."
Exodus	Exo	2	20	21	So the people stood at a distance, while Moses approached the thick cloud where God was.
Exodus	Exo	2	20	22	Then the LORD said to Moses, "Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, 'You yourselves have seen that I have spoken to you from heaven.
Exodus	Exo	2	20	23	'You shall not make other gods besides Me; gods of silver or gods of gold, you shall not make for yourselves.
Exodus	Exo	2	20	24	'You shall make an altar of earth for Me, and you shall sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your oxen; in every place where I cause My name to be remembered, I will come to you and bless you.
Exodus	Exo	2	20	25	'If you make an altar of stone for Me, you shall not build it of cut stones, for if you wield your tool on it, you will profane it.
Exodus	Exo	2	20	26	'And you shall not go up by steps to My altar, so that your nakedness will not be exposed on it.'
Exodus	Exo	2	21	1	"Now these are the ordinances which you are to set before them:
Exodus	Exo	2	21	2	"If you buy a Hebrew slave, he shall serve for six years; but on the seventh he shall go out as a free man without payment.
Exodus	Exo	2	21	3	"If he comes alone, he shall go out alone; if he is the husband of a wife, then his wife shall go out with him.
Exodus	Exo	2	21	4	"If his master gives him a wife, and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall belong to her master, and he shall go out alone.
Exodus	Exo	2	21	5	"But if the slave plainly says, 'I love my master, my wife and my children; I will not go out as a free man,'
Exodus	Exo	2	21	6	then his master shall bring him to God, then he shall bring him to the door or the doorpost. And his master shall pierce his ear with an awl; and he shall serve him permanently.
Exodus	Exo	2	21	7	"If a man sells his daughter as a female slave, she is not to go free as the male slaves do.
Exodus	Exo	2	21	8	"If she is displeasing in the eyes of her master who designated her for himself, then he shall let her be redeemed. He does not have authority to sell her to a foreign people because of his unfairness to her.
Exodus	Exo	2	21	9	"If he designates her for his son, he shall deal with her according to the custom of daughters.
Exodus	Exo	2	21	10	"If he takes to himself another woman, he may not reduce her food, her clothing, or her conjugal rights.
Exodus	Exo	2	21	11	"If he will not do these three things for her, then she shall go out for nothing, without payment of money.
Exodus	Exo	2	21	12	"He who strikes a man so that he dies shall surely be put to death.
Exodus	Exo	2	21	13	"But if he did not lie in wait for him, but God let him fall into his hand, then I will appoint you a place to which he may flee.
Exodus	Exo	2	21	14	"If, however, a man acts presumptuously toward his neighbor, so as to kill him craftily, you are to take him even from My altar, that he may die.
Exodus	Exo	2	21	15	"He who strikes his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.
Exodus	Exo	2	21	16	"He who kidnaps a man, whether he sells him or he is found in his possession, shall surely be put to death.
Exodus	Exo	2	21	17	"He who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.
Exodus	Exo	2	21	18	"If men have a quarrel and one strikes the other with a stone or with his fist, and he does not die but remains in bed,
Exodus	Exo	2	21	19	if he gets up and walks around outside on his staff, then he who struck him shall go unpunished; he shall only pay for his loss of time, and shall take care of him until he is completely healed.
Exodus	Exo	2	21	20	"If a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod and he dies at his hand, he shall be punished.
Exodus	Exo	2	21	21	"If, however, he survives a day or two, no vengeance shall be taken; for he is his property.
Exodus	Exo	2	21	22	"If men struggle with each other and strike a woman with child so that she gives birth prematurely, yet there is no injury, he shall surely be fined as the woman's husband may demand of him, and he shall pay as the judges decide.
Exodus	Exo	2	21	23	"But if there is any further injury, then you shall appoint as a penalty life for life,
Exodus	Exo	2	21	24	eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
Exodus	Exo	2	21	25	burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.
Exodus	Exo	2	21	26	"If a man strikes the eye of his male or female slave, and destroys it, he shall let him go free on account of his eye.
Exodus	Exo	2	21	27	"And if he knocks out a tooth of his male or female slave, he shall let him go free on account of his tooth.
Exodus	Exo	2	21	28	"If an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox shall surely be stoned and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall go unpunished.
Exodus	Exo	2	21	29	"If, however, an ox was previously in the habit of goring and its owner has been warned, yet he does not confine it and it kills a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned and its owner also shall be put to death.
Exodus	Exo	2	21	30	"If a ransom is demanded of him, then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatever is demanded of him.
Exodus	Exo	2	21	31	"Whether it gores a son or a daughter, it shall be done to him according to the same rule.
Exodus	Exo	2	21	32	"If the ox gores a male or female slave, the owner shall give his or her master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.
Exodus	Exo	2	21	33	"If a man opens a pit, or digs a pit and does not cover it over, and an ox or a donkey falls into it,
Exodus	Exo	2	21	34	the owner of the pit shall make restitution; he shall give money to its owner, and the dead animal shall become his.
Exodus	Exo	2	21	35	"If one man's ox hurts another's so that it dies, then they shall sell the live ox and divide its price equally; and also they shall divide the dead ox.
Exodus	Exo	2	21	36	"Or if it is known that the ox was previously in the habit of goring, yet its owner has not confined it, he shall surely pay ox for ox, and the dead animal shall become his.
Exodus	Exo	2	22	1	"If a man steals an ox or a sheep and slaughters it or sells it, he shall pay five oxen for the ox and four sheep for the sheep.
Exodus	Exo	2	22	2	"If the thief is caught while breaking in and is struck so that he dies, there will be no bloodguiltiness on his account.
Exodus	Exo	2	22	3	"But if the sun has risen on him, there will be bloodguiltiness on his account. He shall surely make restitution; if he owns nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.
Exodus	Exo	2	22	4	"If what he stole is actually found alive in his possession, whether an ox or a donkey or a sheep, he shall pay double.
Exodus	Exo	2	22	5	"If a man lets a field or vineyard be grazed bare and lets his animal loose so that it grazes in another man's field, he shall make restitution from the best of his own field and the best of his own vineyard.
Exodus	Exo	2	22	6	"If a fire breaks out and spreads to thorn bushes, so that stacked grain or the standing grain or the field itself is consumed, he who started the fire shall surely make restitution.
Exodus	Exo	2	22	7	"If a man gives his neighbor money or goods to keep for him and it is stolen from the man's house, if the thief is caught, he shall pay double.
Exodus	Exo	2	22	8	"If the thief is not caught, then the owner of the house shall appear before the judges, to determine whether he laid his hands on his neighbor's property.
Exodus	Exo	2	22	9	"For every breach of trust, whether it is for ox, for donkey, for sheep, for clothing, or for any lost thing about which one says, 'This is it,' the case of both parties shall come before the judges; he whom the judges condemn shall pay double to his neighbor.
Exodus	Exo	2	22	10	"If a man gives his neighbor a donkey, an ox, a sheep, or any animal to keep for him, and it dies or is hurt or is driven away while no one is looking,
Exodus	Exo	2	22	11	an oath before the LORD shall be made by the two of them that he has not laid hands on his neighbor's property; and its owner shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution.
Exodus	Exo	2	22	12	"But if it is actually stolen from him, he shall make restitution to its owner.
Exodus	Exo	2	22	13	"If it is all torn to pieces, let him bring it as evidence; he shall not make restitution for what has been torn to pieces.
Exodus	Exo	2	22	14	"If a man borrows anything from his neighbor, and it is injured or dies while its owner is not with it, he shall make full restitution.
Exodus	Exo	2	22	15	"If its owner is with it, he shall not make restitution; if it is hired, it came for its hire.
Exodus	Exo	2	22	16	"If a man seduces a virgin who is not engaged, and lies with her, he must pay a dowry for her to be his wife.
Exodus	Exo	2	22	17	"If her father absolutely refuses to give her to him, he shall pay money equal to the dowry for virgins.
Exodus	Exo	2	22	18	"You shall not allow a sorceress to live.
Exodus	Exo	2	22	19	"Whoever lies with an animal shall surely be put to death.
Exodus	Exo	2	22	20	"He who sacrifices to any god, other than to the LORD alone, shall be utterly destroyed.
Exodus	Exo	2	22	21	"You shall not wrong a stranger or oppress him, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.
Exodus	Exo	2	22	22	"You shall not afflict any widow or orphan.
Exodus	Exo	2	22	23	"If you afflict him at all, and if he does cry out to Me, I will surely hear his cry;
Exodus	Exo	2	22	24	and My anger will be kindled, and I will kill you with the sword, and your wives shall become widows and your children fatherless.
Exodus	Exo	2	22	25	"If you lend money to My people, to the poor among you, you are not to act as a creditor to him; you shall not charge him interest.
Exodus	Exo	2	22	26	"If you ever take your neighbor's cloak as a pledge, you are to return it to him before the sun sets,
Exodus	Exo	2	22	27	for that is his only covering; it is his cloak for his body. What else shall he sleep in? And it shall come about that when he cries out to Me, I will hear him, for I am gracious.
Exodus	Exo	2	22	28	"You shall not curse God, nor curse a ruler of your people.
Exodus	Exo	2	22	29	"You shall not delay the offering from your harvest and your vintage. The firstborn of your sons you shall give to Me.
Exodus	Exo	2	22	30	"You shall do the same with your oxen and with your sheep. It shall be with its mother seven days; on the eighth day you shall give it to Me.
Exodus	Exo	2	22	31	"You shall be holy men to Me, therefore you shall not eat any flesh torn to pieces in the field; you shall throw it to the dogs.
Exodus	Exo	2	23	1	"You shall not bear a false report; do not join your hand with a wicked man to be a malicious witness.
Exodus	Exo	2	23	2	"You shall not follow the masses in doing evil, nor shall you testify in a dispute so as to turn aside after a multitude in order to pervert justice;
Exodus	Exo	2	23	3	nor shall you be partial to a poor man in his dispute.
Exodus	Exo	2	23	4	"If you meet your enemy's ox or his donkey wandering away, you shall surely return it to him.
Exodus	Exo	2	23	5	"If you see the donkey of one who hates you lying helpless under its load, you shall refrain from leaving it to him, you shall surely release it with him.
Exodus	Exo	2	23	6	"You shall not pervert the justice due to your needy brother in his dispute.
Exodus	Exo	2	23	7	"Keep far from a false charge, and do not kill the innocent or the righteous, for I will not acquit the guilty.
Exodus	Exo	2	23	8	"You shall not take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the clear-sighted and subverts the cause of the just.
Exodus	Exo	2	23	9	"You shall not oppress a stranger, since you yourselves know the feelings of a stranger, for you also were strangers in the land of Egypt.
Exodus	Exo	2	23	10	"You shall sow your land for six years and gather in its yield,
Exodus	Exo	2	23	11	but on the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie fallow, so that the needy of your people may eat; and whatever they leave the beast of the field may eat. You are to do the same with your vineyard and your olive grove.
Exodus	Exo	2	23	12	"Six days you are to do your work, but on the seventh day you shall cease from labor so that your ox and your donkey may rest, and the son of your female slave, as well as your stranger, may refresh themselves.
Exodus	Exo	2	23	13	"Now concerning everything which I have said to you, be on your guard; and do not mention the name of other gods, nor let them be heard from your mouth.
Exodus	Exo	2	23	14	"Three times a year you shall celebrate a feast to Me.
Exodus	Exo	2	23	15	"You shall observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread; for seven days you are to eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the appointed time in the month Abib, for in it you came out of Egypt. And none shall appear before Me empty-handed.
Exodus	Exo	2	23	16	"Also you shall observe the Feast of the Harvest of the first fruits of your labors from what you sow in the field; also the Feast of the Ingathering at the end of the year when you gather in the fruit of your labors from the field.
Exodus	Exo	2	23	17	"Three times a year all your males shall appear before the Lord GOD.
Exodus	Exo	2	23	18	"You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread; nor is the fat of My feast to remain overnight until morning.
Exodus	Exo	2	23	19	"You shall bring the choice first fruits of your soil into the house of the LORD your God. "You are not to boil a young goat in the milk of its mother.
Exodus	Exo	2	23	20	"Behold, I am going to send an angel before you to guard you along the way and to bring you into the place which I have prepared.
Exodus	Exo	2	23	21	"Be on your guard before him and obey his voice; do not be rebellious toward him, for he will not pardon your transgression, since My name is in him.
Exodus	Exo	2	23	22	"But if you truly obey his voice and do all that I say, then I will be an enemy to your enemies and an adversary to your adversaries.
Exodus	Exo	2	23	23	"For My angel will go before you and bring you in to the land of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hivites and the Jebusites; and I will completely destroy them.
Exodus	Exo	2	23	24	"You shall not worship their gods, nor serve them, nor do according to their deeds; but you shall utterly overthrow them and break their sacred pillars in pieces.
Exodus	Exo	2	23	25	"But you shall serve the LORD your God, and He will bless your bread and your water; and I will remove sickness from your midst.
Exodus	Exo	2	23	26	"There shall be no one miscarrying or barren in your land; I will fulfill the number of your days.
Exodus	Exo	2	23	27	"I will send My terror ahead of you, and throw into confusion all the people among whom you come, and I will make all your enemies turn their backs to you.
Exodus	Exo	2	23	28	"I will send hornets ahead of you so that they will drive out the Hivites, the Canaanites, and the Hittites before you.
Exodus	Exo	2	23	29	"I will not drive them out before you in a single year, that the land may not become desolate and the beasts of the field become too numerous for you.
Exodus	Exo	2	23	30	"I will drive them out before you little by little, until you become fruitful and take possession of the land.
Exodus	Exo	2	23	31	"I will fix your boundary from the Red Sea to the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness to the River Euphrates; for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand, and you will drive them out before you.
Exodus	Exo	2	23	32	"You shall make no covenant with them or with their gods.
Exodus	Exo	2	23	33	"They shall not live in your land, because they will make you sin against Me; for if you serve their gods, it will surely be a snare to you."
Exodus	Exo	2	24	1	Then He said to Moses, "Come up to the LORD, you and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu and seventy of the elders of Israel, and you shall worship at a distance.
Exodus	Exo	2	24	2	"Moses alone, however, shall come near to the LORD, but they shall not come near, nor shall the people come up with him."
Exodus	Exo	2	24	3	Then Moses came and recounted to the people all the words of the LORD and all the ordinances; and all the people answered with one voice and said, "All the words which the LORD has spoken we will do!"
Exodus	Exo	2	24	4	Moses wrote down all the words of the LORD. Then he arose early in the morning, and built an altar at the foot of the mountain with twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel.
Exodus	Exo	2	24	5	He sent young men of the sons of Israel, and they offered burnt offerings and sacrificed young bulls as peace offerings to the LORD.
Exodus	Exo	2	24	6	Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins, and the other half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.
Exodus	Exo	2	24	7	Then he took the book of the covenant and read it in the hearing of the people; and they said, "All that the LORD has spoken we will do, and we will be obedient!"
Exodus	Exo	2	24	8	So Moses took the blood and sprinkled it on the people, and said, "Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD has made with you in accordance with all these words."
Exodus	Exo	2	24	9	Then Moses went up with Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel,
Exodus	Exo	2	24	10	and they saw the God of Israel; and under His feet there appeared to be a pavement of sapphire, as clear as the sky itself.
Exodus	Exo	2	24	11	Yet He did not stretch out His hand against the nobles of the sons of Israel; and they saw God, and they ate and drank.
Exodus	Exo	2	24	12	Now the LORD said to Moses, "Come up to Me on the mountain and remain there, and I will give you the stone tablets with the law and the commandment which I have written for their instruction."
Exodus	Exo	2	24	13	So Moses arose with Joshua his servant, and Moses went up to the mountain of God.
Exodus	Exo	2	24	14	But to the elders he said, "Wait here for us until we return to you. And behold, Aaron and Hur are with you; whoever has a legal matter, let him approach them."
Exodus	Exo	2	24	15	Then Moses went up to the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain.
Exodus	Exo	2	24	16	The glory of the LORD rested on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it for six days; and on the seventh day He called to Moses from the midst of the cloud.
Exodus	Exo	2	24	17	And to the eyes of the sons of Israel the appearance of the glory of the LORD was like a consuming fire on the mountain top.
Exodus	Exo	2	24	18	Moses entered the midst of the cloud as he went up to the mountain; and Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights.
Exodus	Exo	2	25	1	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Exodus	Exo	2	25	2	"Tell the sons of Israel to raise a contribution for Me; from every man whose heart moves him you shall raise My contribution.
Exodus	Exo	2	25	3	"This is the contribution which you are to raise from them: gold, silver and bronze,
Exodus	Exo	2	25	4	blue, purple and scarlet material, fine linen, goat hair,
Exodus	Exo	2	25	5	rams' skins dyed red, porpoise skins, acacia wood,
Exodus	Exo	2	25	6	oil for lighting, spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense,
Exodus	Exo	2	25	7	onyx stones and setting stones for the ephod and for the breastpiece.

Exodus	Exo	2	30	2	"Its length shall be a cubit, and its width a cubit, it shall be square, and its height shall be two cubits; its horns shall be of one piece with it.
Exodus	Exo	2	30	3	"You shall overlay it with pure gold, its top and its sides all around, and its horns; and you shall make a gold molding all around for it.
Exodus	Exo	2	30	4	"You shall make two gold rings for it under its molding; you shall make them on its two side walls--on opposite sides--and they shall be holders for poles with which to carry it.
Exodus	Exo	2	30	5	"You shall make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold.
Exodus	Exo	2	30	6	"You shall put this altar in front of the veil that is near the ark of the testimony, in front of the mercy seat that is over the ark of the testimony, where I will meet with you.
Exodus	Exo	2	30	7	"Aaron shall burn fragrant incense on it; he shall burn it every morning when he trims the lamps.
Exodus	Exo	2	30	8	"When Aaron trims the lamps at twilight, he shall burn incense. There shall be perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations.
Exodus	Exo	2	30	9	"You shall not offer any strange incense on this altar, or burnt offering or meal offering; and you shall not pour out a drink offering on it.
Exodus	Exo	2	30	10	"Aaron shall make atonement on its horns once a year; he shall make atonement on it with the blood of the sin offering of atonement once a year throughout your generations. It is most holy to the LORD."
Exodus	Exo	2	30	11	The LORD also spoke to Moses, saying,
Exodus	Exo	2	30	12	"When you take a census of the sons of Israel to number them, then each one of them shall give a ransom for himself to the LORD, when you number them, so that there will be no plague among them when you number them.
Exodus	Exo	2	30	13	"This is what everyone who is numbered shall give: half a shekel according to the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel is twenty gerahs), half a shekel as a contribution to the LORD.
Exodus	Exo	2	30	14	"Everyone who is numbered, from twenty years old and over, shall give the contribution to the LORD.
Exodus	Exo	2	30	15	"The rich shall not pay more and the poor shall not pay less than the half shekel, when you give the contribution to the LORD to make atonement for yourselves.
Exodus	Exo	2	30	16	"You shall take the atonement money from the sons of Israel and shall give it for the service of the tent of meeting, that it may be a memorial for the sons of Israel before the LORD, to make atonement for yourselves."
Exodus	Exo	2	30	17	The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Exodus	Exo	2	30	18	"You shall also make a laver of bronze, with its base of bronze, for washing; and you shall put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and you shall put water in it.
Exodus	Exo	2	30	19	"Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet from it;
Exodus	Exo	2	30	20	when they enter the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water, so that they will not die; or when they approach the altar to minister, by offering up in smoke a fire sacrifice to the LORD.
Exodus	Exo	2	30	21	"So they shall wash their hands and their feet, so that they will not die; and it shall be a perpetual statute for them, for Aaron and his descendants throughout their generations."
Exodus	Exo	2	30	22	Moreover, the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Exodus	Exo	2	30	23	"Take also for yourself the finest of spices: of flowing myrrh five hundred shekels, and of fragrant cinnamon half as much, two hundred and fifty, and of fragrant cane two hundred and fifty,
Exodus	Exo	2	30	24	and of cassia five hundred, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, and of olive oil a hin.
Exodus	Exo	2	30	25	"You shall make of these a holy anointing oil, a perfume mixture, the work of a perfumer; it shall be a holy anointing oil.
Exodus	Exo	2	30	26	"With it you shall anoint the tent of meeting and the ark of the testimony,
Exodus	Exo	2	30	27	and the table and all its utensils, and the lampstand and its utensils, and the altar of incense,
Exodus	Exo	2	30	28	and the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the laver and its stand.
Exodus	Exo	2	30	29	"You shall also consecrate them, that they may be most holy; whatever touches them shall be holy.
Exodus	Exo	2	30	30	"You shall anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that they may minister as priests to Me.
Exodus	Exo	2	30	31	"You shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'This shall be a holy anointing oil to Me throughout your generations.
Exodus	Exo	2	30	32	'It shall not be poured on anyone's body, nor shall you make any like it in the same proportions; it is holy, and it shall be holy to you.
Exodus	Exo	2	30	33	'Whoever shall mix any like it or whoever puts any of it on a layman shall be cut off from his people.'"
Exodus	Exo	2	30	34	Then the LORD said to Moses, "Take for yourself spices, stacte and onycha and galbanum, spices with pure frankincense; there shall be an equal part of each.
Exodus	Exo	2	30	35	"With it you shall make incense, a perfume, the work of a perfumer, salted, pure, and holy.
Exodus	Exo	2	30	36	"You shall beat some of it very fine, and put part of it before the testimony in the tent of meeting where I will meet with you; it shall be most holy to you.
Exodus	Exo	2	30	37	"The incense which you shall make, you shall not make in the same proportions for yourselves; it shall be holy to you for the LORD.
Exodus	Exo	2	30	38	"Whoever shall make any like it, to use as perfume, shall be cut off from his people."
Exodus	Exo	2	31	1	Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Exodus	Exo	2	31	2	"See, I have called by name Bezalel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.
Exodus	Exo	2	31	3	"I have filled him with the Spirit of God in wisdom, in understanding, in knowledge, and in all kinds of craftsmanship,
Exodus	Exo	2	31	4	to make artistic designs for work in gold, in silver, and in bronze,
Exodus	Exo	2	31	5	and in the cutting of stones for settings, and in the carving of wood, that he may work in all kinds of craftsmanship.
Exodus	Exo	2	31	6	"And behold, I Myself have appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the hearts of all who are skillful I have put skill, that they may make all that I have commanded you:
Exodus	Exo	2	31	7	the tent of meeting, and the ark of testimony, and the mercy seat upon it, and all the furniture of the tent,
Exodus	Exo	2	31	8	the table also and its utensils, and the pure gold lampstand with all its utensils, and the altar of incense,
Exodus	Exo	2	31	9	the altar of burnt offering also with all its utensils, and the laver and its stand,
Exodus	Exo	2	31	10	the woven garments as well, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, with which to carry on their priesthood;
Exodus	Exo	2	31	11	the anointing oil also, and the fragrant incense for the holy place, they are to make them according to all that I have commanded you."
Exodus	Exo	2	31	12	The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Exodus	Exo	2	31	13	"But as for you, speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'You shall surely observe My sabbaths; for this is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I am the LORD who sanctifies you.
Exodus	Exo	2	31	14	'Therefore you are to observe the sabbath, for it is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does any work on it, that person shall be cut off from among his people.
Exodus	Exo	2	31	15	'For six days work may be done, but on the seventh day there is a sabbath of complete rest, holy to the LORD; whoever does any work on the sabbath day shall surely be put to death.
Exodus	Exo	2	31	16	'So the sons of Israel shall observe the sabbath, to celebrate the sabbath throughout their generations as a perpetual covenant.'
Exodus	Exo	2	31	17	"It is a sign between Me and the sons of Israel forever; for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, but on the seventh day He ceased from labor, and was refreshed."
Exodus	Exo	2	31	18	When He had finished speaking with him upon Mount Sinai, He gave Moses the two tablets of the testimony, tablets of stone, written by the finger of God.
Exodus	Exo	2	32	1	Now when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain, the people assembled about Aaron and said to him, "Come, make us a god who will go before us; as for this Moses, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him."
Exodus	Exo	2	32	2	Aaron said to them, "Tear off the gold rings which are in the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me."
Exodus	Exo	2	32	3	Then all the people tore off the gold rings which were in their ears and brought them to Aaron.
Exodus	Exo	2	32	4	He took this from their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool and made it into a molten calf; and they said, "This is your god, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt."
Exodus	Exo	2	32	5	Now when Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made a proclamation and said, "Tomorrow shall be a feast to the LORD."
Exodus	Exo	2	32	6	So the next day they rose early and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.
Exodus	Exo	2	32	7	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, "Go down at once, for your people, whom you brought up from the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves.
Exodus	Exo	2	32	8	"They have quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them. They have made for themselves a molten calf, and have worshiped it and have sacrificed to it and said, 'This is your god, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt!'"
Exodus	Exo	2	32	9	The LORD said to Moses, "I have seen this people, and behold, they are an obstinate people.
Exodus	Exo	2	32	10	"Now then let Me alone, that My anger may burn against them and that I may destroy them; and I will make of you a great nation."
Exodus	Exo	2	32	11	Then Moses entreated the LORD his God, and said, "O LORD, why does Your anger burn against Your people whom You have brought out from the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?
Exodus	Exo	2	32	12	"Why should the Egyptians speak, saying, 'With evil intent He brought them out to kill them in the mountains and to destroy them from the face of the earth'? Turn from Your burning anger and change Your mind about doing harm to Your people.
Exodus	Exo	2	32	13	"Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Your servants to whom You swore by Yourself, and said to them, 'I will multiply your descendants as the stars of the heavens, and all this land of which I have spoken I will give to your descendants, and they shall inherit it forever.'"
Exodus	Exo	2	32	14	So the LORD changed His mind about the harm which He said He would do to His people.
Exodus	Exo	2	32	15	Then Moses turned and went down from the mountain with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand, tablets which were written on both sides; they were written on one side and the other.
Exodus	Exo	2	32	16	The tablets were God's work, and the writing was God's writing engraved on the tablets.
Exodus	Exo	2	32	17	Now when Joshua heard the sound of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, "There is a sound of war in the camp."
Exodus	Exo	2	32	18	But he said, "It is not the sound of the cry of triumph, Nor is it the sound of the cry of defeat; But the sound of singing I hear."
Exodus	Exo	2	32	19	It came about, as soon as Moses came near the camp, that he saw the calf and the dancing; and Moses' anger burned, and he threw the tablets from his hands and shattered them at the foot of the mountain.
Exodus	Exo	2	32	20	He took the calf which they had made and burned it with fire, and ground it to powder, and scattered it over the surface of the water and made the sons of Israel drink it.
Exodus	Exo	2	32	21	Then Moses said to Aaron, "What did this people do to you, that you have brought such great sin upon them?"
Exodus	Exo	2	32	22	Aaron said, "Do not let the anger of my lord burn; you know the people yourself, that they are prone to evil.
Exodus	Exo	2	32	23	"For they said to me, 'Make a god for us who will go before us; for this Moses, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.'
Exodus	Exo	2	32	24	"I said to them, 'Whoever has any gold, let them tear it off.' So they gave it to me, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf."
Exodus	Exo	2	32	25	Now when Moses saw that the people were out of control--for Aaron had let them get out of control to be a derision among their enemies--
Exodus	Exo	2	32	26	then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, "Whoever is for the LORD, come to me!" And all the sons of Levi gathered together to him.
Exodus	Exo	2	32	27	He said to them, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Every man of you put his sword upon his thigh, and go back and forth from gate to gate in the camp, and kill every man his brother, and every man his friend, and every man his neighbor.'"
Exodus	Exo	2	32	28	So the sons of Levi did as Moses instructed, and about three thousand men of the people fell that day.
Exodus	Exo	2	32	29	Then Moses said, "Dedicate yourselves today to the LORD--for every man has been against his son and against his brother--in order that He may bestow a blessing upon you today."
Exodus	Exo	2	32	30	On the next day Moses said to the people, "You yourselves have committed a great sin; and now I am going up to the LORD, perhaps I can make atonement for your sin."
Exodus	Exo	2	32	31	Then Moses returned to the LORD, and said, "Alas, this people has committed a great sin, and they have made a god of gold for themselves.
Exodus	Exo	2	32	32	"But now, if You will, forgive their sin--and if not, please blot me out from Your book which You have written!"
Exodus	Exo	2	32	33	The LORD said to Moses, "Whoever has sinned against Me, I will blot him out of My book.
Exodus	Exo	2	32	34	"But go now, lead the people where I told you. Behold, My angel shall go before you; nevertheless in the day when I punish, I will punish them for their sin."
Exodus	Exo	2	32	35	Then the LORD smote the people, because of what they did with the calf which Aaron had made.
Exodus	Exo	2	33	1	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, "Depart, go up from here, you and the people whom you have brought up from the land of Egypt, to the land of which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, 'To your descendants I will give it.'
Exodus	Exo	2	33	2	"I will send an angel before you and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite.
Exodus	Exo	2	33	3	"Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey; for I will not go up in your midst, because you are an obstinate people, and I might destroy you on the way."
Exodus	Exo	2	33	4	When the people heard this sad word, they went into mourning, and none of them put on his ornaments.
Exodus	Exo	2	33	5	For the LORD had said to Moses, "Say to the sons of Israel, 'You are an obstinate people; should I go up in your midst for one moment, I would destroy you. Now therefore, put off your ornaments from you, that I may know what I shall do with you.'"
Exodus	Exo	2	33	6	So the sons of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments, from Mount Horeb onward.
Exodus	Exo	2	33	7	Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it outside the camp, a good distance from the camp, and he called it the tent of meeting. And everyone who sought the LORD would go out to the tent of meeting which was outside the camp.
Exodus	Exo	2	33	8	And it came about, whenever Moses went out to the tent, that all the people would arise and stand, each at the entrance of his tent, and gaze after Moses until he entered the tent.
Exodus	Exo	2	33	9	Whenever Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the entrance of the tent; and the LORD would speak with Moses.
Exodus	Exo	2	33	10	When all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent, all the people would arise and worship, each at the entrance of his tent.
Exodus	Exo	2	33	11	Thus the LORD used to speak to Moses face to face, just as a man speaks to his friend. When Moses returned to the camp, his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, would not depart from the tent.
Exodus	Exo	2	33	12	Then Moses said to the LORD, "See, You say to me, 'Bring up this people!' But You Yourself have not let me know whom You will send with me. Moreover, You have said, 'I have known you by name, and you have also found favor in My sight.'
Exodus	Exo	2	33	13	"Now therefore, I pray You, if I have found favor in Your sight, let me know Your ways that I may know You, so that I may find favor in Your sight. Consider too, that this nation is Your people."
Exodus	Exo	2	33	14	And He said, "My presence shall go with you, and I will give you rest."
Exodus	Exo	2	33	15	Then he said to Him, "If Your presence does not go with us, do not lead us up from here.
Exodus	Exo	2	33	16	"For how then can it be known that I have found favor in Your sight, I and Your people? Is it not by Your going with us, so that we, I and Your people, may be distinguished from all the other people who are upon the face of the earth?"
Exodus	Exo	2	33	17	The LORD said to Moses, "I will also do this thing of which you have spoken; for you have found favor in My sight and I have known you by name."
Exodus	Exo	2	33	18	Then Moses said, "I pray You, show me Your glory!"
Exodus	Exo	2	33	19	And He said, "I Myself will make all My goodness pass before you, and will proclaim the name of the LORD before you; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show compassion on whom I will show compassion."
Exodus	Exo	2	33	20	But He said, "You cannot see My face, for no man can see Me and live!"
Exodus	Exo	2	33	21	Then the LORD said, "Behold, there is a place by Me, and you shall stand there on the rock;
Exodus	Exo	2	33	22	and it will come about, while My glory is passing by, that I will put you in the cleft of the rock and cover you with My hand until I have passed by.
Exodus	Exo	2	33	23	"Then I will take My hand away and you shall see My back, but My face shall not be seen."
Exodus	Exo	2	34	1	Now the LORD said to Moses, "Cut out for yourself two stone tablets like the former ones, and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the former tablets which you shattered.
Exodus	Exo	2	34	2	"So be ready by morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to Me on the top of the mountain.
Exodus	Exo	2	34	3	"No man is to come up with you, nor let any man be seen anywhere on the mountain; even the flocks and the herds may not graze in front of that mountain."
Exodus	Exo	2	34	4	So he cut out two stone tablets like the former ones, and Moses rose up early in the morning and went up to Mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and he took two stone tablets in his hand.
Exodus	Exo	2	34	5	The LORD descended in the cloud and stood there with him as he called upon the name of the LORD.
Exodus	Exo	2	34	6	Then the LORD passed by in front of him and proclaimed, "The LORD, the LORD God, compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in lovingkindness and truth;
Exodus	Exo	2	34	7	who keeps lovingkindness for thousands, who forgives iniquity, transgression and sin; yet He will by no means leave the guilty unpunished, visiting the iniquity of fathers on the children and on the grandchildren to the third and fourth generations."
Exodus	Exo	2	34	8	Moses made haste to bow low toward the earth and worship.
Exodus	Exo	2	34	9	He said, "If now I have found favor in Your sight, O Lord, I pray, let the Lord go along in our midst, even though the people are so obstinate, and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us as Your own possession."
Exodus	Exo	2	34	10	Then God said, "Behold, I am going to make a covenant. Before all your people I will perform miracles which have not been produced in all the earth nor among any of the nations; and all the people among whom you live will see the working of the LORD, for it is a fearful thing that I am going to perform with you.
Exodus	Exo	2	34	11	"Be sure to observe what I am commanding you this day: behold, I am going to drive out the Amorite before you, and the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite.
Exodus	Exo	2	34	12	"Watch yourself that you make no covenant with the inhabitants of the land into which you are going, or it will become a snare in your midst.
Exodus	Exo	2	34	13	"But rather, you are to tear down their altars and smash their sacred pillars and cut down their Asherim
Exodus	Exo	2	34	14	--for you shall not worship any other god, for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God--
Exodus	Exo	2	34	15	otherwise you might make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land and they would play the harlot with their gods and sacrifice to their gods, and someone might invite you to eat of his sacrifice,
Exodus	Exo	2	34	16	and you might take some of his daughters for your sons, and his daughters might play the harlot with their gods and cause your sons also to play the harlot with their gods.
Exodus	Exo	2	34	17	"You shall make for yourself no molten gods.
Exodus	Exo	2	34	18	"You shall observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread. For seven days you are to eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the appointed time in the month of Abib, for in the month of Abib you came out of Egypt.
Exodus	Exo	2	34	19	"The first offspring from every womb belongs to Me, and all your male livestock, the first offspring from cattle and sheep.
Exodus	Exo	2	34	20	"You shall redeem with a lamb the first offspring from a donkey; and if you do not redeem it, then you shall break its neck. You shall redeem all the firstborn of your sons. None shall appear before Me empty-handed.
Exodus	Exo	2	34	21	"You shall work six days, but on the seventh day you shall rest; even during plowing time and harvest you shall rest.
Exodus	Exo	2	34	22	"You shall celebrate the Feast of Weeks, that is, the first fruits of the wheat harvest, and the Feast of Ingathering at the turn of the year.
Exodus	Exo	2	34	23	"Three times a year all your males are to appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel.
Exodus	Exo	2	34	24	"For I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your borders, and no man shall covet your land when you go up three times a year to appear before the LORD your God.
Exodus	Exo	2	34	25	"You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread, nor is the sacrifice of the Feast of the Passover to be left over until morning.
Exodus	Exo	2	34	26	"You shall bring the very first of the first fruits of your soil into the house of the LORD your God. "You shall not boil a young goat in its mother's milk."
Exodus	Exo	2	34	27	Then the LORD said to Moses, "Write down these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel."
Exodus	Exo	2	34	28	So he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did not eat bread or drink water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the Ten Commandments.
Exodus	Exo	2	34	29	It came about when Moses was coming down from Mount Sinai (and the two tablets of the testimony were in Moses' hand as he was coming down from the mountain), that Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because of his speaking with Him.
Exodus	Exo	2	34	30	So when Aaron and all the sons of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come near him.
Exodus	Exo	2	34	31	Then Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the rulers in the congregation returned to him; and Moses spoke to them.
Exodus	Exo	2	34	32	Afterward all the sons of Israel came near, and he commanded them to do everything that the LORD had spoken to him on Mount Sinai.
Exodus	Exo	2	34	33	When Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil over his face.
Exodus	Exo	2	34	34	But whenever Moses went in before the LORD to speak with Him, he would take off the veil until he came out; and whenever he came out and spoke to the sons of Israel what he had been commanded,
Exodus	Exo	2	34	35	the sons of Israel would see the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone. So Moses would replace the veil over his face until he went in to speak with Him.
Exodus	Exo	2	35	1	Then Moses assembled all the congregation of the sons of Israel, and said to them, "These are the things that the LORD has commanded you to do:
Exodus	Exo	2	35	2	"For six days work may be done, but on the seventh day you shall have a holy day, a sabbath of complete rest to the LORD; whoever does any work on it shall be put to death.
Exodus	Exo	2	35	3	"You shall not kindle a fire in any of your dwellings on the sabbath day."
Exodus	Exo	2	35	4	Moses spoke to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, saying, "This is the thing which the LORD has commanded, saying,
Exodus	Exo	2	35	5	'Take from among you a contribution to the LORD; whoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it as the LORD'S contribution: gold, silver, and bronze,
Exodus	Exo	2	35	6	and blue, purple and scarlet material, fine linen, goats' hair,
Exodus	Exo	2	35	7	and rams' skins dyed red, and porpoise skins, and acacia wood,
Exodus	Exo	2	35	8	and oil for lighting, and spices for the anointing oil, and for the fragrant incense,
Exodus	Exo	2	35	9	and onyx stones and setting stones for the ephod and for the breastpiece.
Exodus	Exo	2	35	10	'Let every skillful man among you come, and make all that the LORD has commanded:
Exodus	Exo	2	35	11	the tabernacle, its tent and its covering, its hooks and its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets;
Exodus	Exo	2	35	12	the ark and its poles, the mercy seat, and the curtain of the screen;
Exodus	Exo	2	35	13	the table and its poles, and all its utensils, and the bread of the Presence;
Exodus	Exo	2	35	14	the lampstand also for the light and its utensils and its lamps and the oil for the light;
Exodus	Exo	2	35	15	and the altar of incense and its poles, and the anointing oil and the fragrant incense, and the screen for the doorway at the entrance of the tabernacle;
Exodus	Exo	2	35	16	the altar of burnt offering with its bronze grating, its poles, and all its utensils, the basin and its stand;
Exodus	Exo	2	35	17	the hangings of the court, its pillars and its sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court;
Exodus	Exo	2	35	18	the pegs of the tabernacle and the pegs of the court and their cords;
Exodus	Exo	2	35	19	the woven garments for ministering in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons, to minister as priests.'"
Exodus	Exo	2	35	20	Then all the congregation of the sons of Israel departed from Moses' presence.
Exodus	Exo	2	35	21	Everyone whose heart stirred him and everyone whose spirit moved him came and brought the LORD'S contribution for the work of the tent of meeting and for all its service and for the holy garments.
Exodus	Exo	2	35	22	Then all whose hearts moved them, both men and women, came and brought brooches and earrings and signet rings and bracelets, all articles of gold; so did every man who presented an offering of gold to the LORD.
Exodus	Exo	2	35	23	Every man, who had in his possession blue and purple and scarlet material and fine linen and goats' hair and rams' skins dyed red and porpoise skins, brought them.
Exodus	Exo	2	35	24	Everyone who could make a contribution of silver and bronze brought the LORD'S contribution; and every man who had in his possession acacia wood for any work of the service brought it.
Exodus	Exo	2	35	25	All the skilled women spun with their hands, and brought what they had spun, in blue and purple and scarlet material and in fine linen.
Exodus	Exo	2	35	26	All the women whose heart stirred with a skill spun the goats' hair.
Exodus	Exo	2	35	27	The rulers brought the onyx stones and the stones for setting for the ephod and for the breastpiece;
Exodus	Exo	2	35	28	and the spice and the oil for the light and for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense.
Exodus	Exo	2	35	29	The Israelites, all the men and women, whose heart moved them to bring material for all the work, which the LORD had commanded through Moses to be done, brought a freewill offering to the LORD.
Exodus	Exo	2	35	30	Then Moses said to the sons of Israel, "See, the LORD has called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.
Exodus	Exo	2	35	31	"And He has filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding and in knowledge and in all craftsmanship;
Exodus	Exo	2	35	32	to make designs for working in gold and in silver and in bronze,
Exodus	Exo	2	35	33	and in the cutting of stones for settings and in the carving of wood, so as to perform in every inventive work.
Exodus	Exo	2	35	34	"He also has put in his heart to teach, both he and Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.
Exodus	Exo	2	35	35	"He has filled them with skill to perform every work of an engraver and of a designer and of an embroiderer, in blue and in purple and in scarlet material, and in fine linen, and of a weaver, as performers of every work and makers of designs.
Exodus	Exo	2	36	1	"Now Bezalel and Oholiab, and every skillful person in whom the LORD has put skill and understanding to know how to perform all the work in the construction of the sanctuary, shall perform in accordance with all that the LORD has commanded."
Exodus	Exo	2	36	2	Then Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab and every skillful person in whom the LORD had put skill, everyone whose heart stirred him, to come to the work to perform it.
Exodus	Exo	2	36	3	They received from Moses all the contributions which the sons of Israel had brought to perform the work in the construction of the sanctuary. And they still continued bringing to him freewill offerings every morning.
Exodus	Exo	2	36	4	And all the skillful men who were performing all the work of the sanctuary came, each from the work which he was performing,
Exodus	Exo	2	36	5	and they said to Moses, "The people are bringing much more than enough for the construction work which the LORD commanded us to perform."
Exodus	Exo	2	36	6	So Moses issued a command, and a proclamation was circulated throughout the camp, saying, "Let no man or woman any longer perform work for the contributions of the sanctuary." Thus the people were restrained from bringing any more.
Exodus	Exo	2	36	7	For the material they had was sufficient and more than enough for all the work, to perform it.
Exodus	Exo	2	36	8	All the skillful men among those who were performing the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains; of fine twisted linen and blue and purple and scarlet material, with cherubim, the work of a skillful workman, Bezalel made them.
Exodus	Exo	2	36	9	The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits and the width of each curtain four cubits; all the curtains had the same measurements.
Exodus	Exo	2	36	10	He joined five curtains to one another and the other five curtains he joined to one another.
Exodus	Exo	2	36	11	He made loops of blue on the edge of the outermost curtain in the first set; he did likewise on the edge of the curtain that was outermost in the second set.
Exodus	Exo	2	36	12	He made fifty loops in the one curtain and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was in the second set; the loops were opposite each other.
Exodus	Exo	2	36	13	He made fifty clasps of gold and joined the curtains to one another with the clasps, so the tabernacle was a unit.
Exodus	Exo	2	36	14	Then he made curtains of goats' hair for a tent over the tabernacle; he made eleven curtains in all.
Exodus	Exo	2	36	15	The length of each curtain was thirty cubits and four cubits the width of each curtain; the eleven curtains had the same measurements.
Exodus	Exo	2	36	16	He joined five curtains by themselves and the other six curtains by themselves.
Exodus	Exo	2	36	17	Moreover, he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was outermost in the first set, and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was outermost in the second set.
Exodus	Exo	2	36	18	He made fifty clasps of bronze to join the tent together so that it would be a unit.
Exodus	Exo	2	36	19	He made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of porpoise skins above.
Exodus	Exo	2	36	20	Then he made the boards for the tabernacle of acacia wood, standing upright.
Exodus	Exo	2	36	21	Ten cubits was the length of each board and one and a half cubits the width of each board.
Exodus	Exo	2	36	22	There were two tenons for each board, fitted to one another; thus he did for all the boards of the tabernacle.
Exodus	Exo	2	36	23	He made the boards for the tabernacle: twenty boards for the south side;
Exodus	Exo	2	36	24	and he made forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for its two tenons and two sockets under another board for its two tenons.
Exodus	Exo	2	36	25	Then for the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, he made twenty boards,
Exodus	Exo	2	36	26	and their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board and two sockets under another board.
Exodus	Exo	2	36	27	For the rear of the tabernacle, to the west, he made six boards.
Exodus	Exo	2	36	28	He made two boards for the corners of the tabernacle at the rear.
Exodus	Exo	2	36	29	They were double beneath, and together they were complete to its top to the first ring; thus he did with both of them for the two corners.
Exodus	Exo	2	36	30	There were eight boards with their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets, two under every board.
Exodus	Exo	2	36	31	Then he made bars of acacia wood, five for the boards of one side of the tabernacle,
Exodus	Exo	2	36	32	and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the rear side to the west.
Exodus	Exo	2	36	33	He made the middle bar to pass through in the center of the boards from end to end.
Exodus	Exo	2	36	34	He overlaid the boards with gold and made their rings of gold as holders for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.
Exodus	Exo	2	36	35	Moreover, he made the veil of blue and purple and scarlet material, and fine twisted linen; he made it with cherubim, the work of a skillful workman.
Exodus	Exo	2	36	36	He made four pillars of acacia for it, and overlaid them with gold, with their hooks of gold; and he cast four sockets of silver for them.
Exodus	Exo	2	36	37	He made a screen for the doorway of the tent, of blue and purple and scarlet material, and fine twisted linen, the work of a weaver;
Exodus	Exo	2	36	38	and he made its five pillars with their hooks, and he overlaid their tops and their bands with gold; but their five sockets were of bronze.
Exodus	Exo	2	37	1	Now Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood; its length was two and a half cubits, and its width one and a half cubits, and its height one and a half cubits;
Exodus	Exo	2	37	2	and he overlaid it with pure gold inside and out, and made a gold molding for it all around.
Exodus	Exo	2	37	3	He cast four rings of gold for it on its four feet; even two rings on one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it.
Exodus	Exo	2	37	4	He made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
Exodus	Exo	2	37	5	He put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark, to carry it.
Exodus	Exo	2	37	6	He made a mercy seat of pure gold, two and a half cubits long and one and a half cubits wide.
Exodus	Exo	2	37	7	He made two cherubim of gold; he made them of hammered work at the two ends of the mercy seat;
Exodus	Exo	2	37	8	one cherub at the one end and one cherub at the other end; he made the cherubim of one piece with the mercy seat at the two ends.
Exodus	Exo	2	37	9	The cherubim had their wings spread upward, covering the mercy seat with their wings, with their faces toward each other; the faces of the cherubim were toward the mercy seat.
Exodus	Exo	2	37	10	Then he made the table of acacia wood, two cubits long and a cubit wide and one and a half cubits high.
Exodus	Exo	2	37	11	He overlaid it with pure gold, and made a gold molding for it all around.
Exodus	Exo	2	37	12	He made a rim for it of a handbreadth all around, and made a gold molding for its rim all around.
Exodus	Exo	2	37	13	He cast four gold rings for it and put the rings on the four corners that were on its four feet.
Exodus	Exo	2	37	14	Close by the rim were the rings, the holders for the poles to carry the table.
Exodus	Exo	2	37	15	He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold, to carry the table.
Exodus	Exo	2	37	16	He made the utensils which were on the table, its dishes and its pans and its bowls and its jars, with which to pour out drink offerings, of pure gold.
Exodus	Exo	2	37	17	Then he made the lampstand of pure gold. He made the lampstand of hammered work, its base and its shaft; its cups, its bulbs and its flowers were of one piece with it.
Exodus	Exo	2	37	18	There were six branches going out of its sides; three branches of the lampstand from the one side of it and three branches of the lampstand from the other side of it;
Exodus	Exo	2	37	19	three cups shaped like almond blossoms, a bulb and a flower in one branch, and three cups shaped like almond blossoms, a bulb and a flower in the other branch--so for the six branches going out of the lampstand.
Exodus	Exo	2	37	20	In the lampstand there were four cups shaped like almond blossoms, its bulbs and its flowers;
Exodus	Exo	2	37	21	and a bulb was under the first pair of branches coming out of it, and a bulb under the second pair of branches coming out of it, and a bulb under the third pair of branches coming out of it, for the six branches coming out of the lampstand.
Exodus	Exo	2	37	22	Their bulbs and their branches were of one piece with it; the whole of it was a single hammered work of pure gold.
Exodus	Exo	2	37	23	He made its seven lamps with its snuffers and its trays of pure gold.
Exodus	Exo	2	37	24	He made it and all its utensils from a talent of pure gold.
Exodus	Exo	2	37	25	Then he made the altar of incense of acacia wood: a cubit long and a cubit wide, square, and two cubits high; its horns were of one piece with it.
Exodus	Exo	2	37	26	He overlaid it with pure gold, its top and its sides all around, and its horns; and he made a gold molding for it all around.
Exodus	Exo	2	37	27	He made two golden rings for it under its molding, on its two sides--on opposite sides--as holders for poles with which to carry it.
Exodus	Exo	2	37	28	He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
Exodus	Exo	2	37	29	And he made the holy anointing oil and the pure, fragrant incense of spices, the work of a perfumer.
Exodus	Exo	2	38	1	Then he made the altar of burnt offering of acacia wood, five cubits long, and five cubits wide, square, and three cubits high.
Exodus	Exo	2	38	2	He made its horns on its four corners, its horns being of one piece with it, and he overlaid it with bronze.
Exodus	Exo	2	38	3	He made all the utensils of the altar, the pails and the shovels and the basins, the flesh hooks and the firepans; he made all its utensils of bronze.
Exodus	Exo	2	38	4	He made for the altar a grating of bronze network beneath, under its ledge, reaching halfway up.
Exodus	Exo	2	38	5	He cast four rings on the four ends of the bronze grating as holders for the poles.
Exodus	Exo	2	38	6	He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with bronze.
Exodus	Exo	2	38	7	He inserted the poles into the rings on the sides of the altar, with which to carry it. He made it hollow with planks.
Exodus	Exo	2	38	8	Moreover, he made the laver of bronze with its base of bronze, from the mirrors of the serving women who served at the doorway of the tent of meeting.
Exodus	Exo	2	38	9	Then he made the court: for the south side the hangings of the court were of fine twisted linen, one hundred cubits;
Exodus	Exo	2	38	10	their twenty pillars, and their twenty sockets, made of bronze; the hooks of the pillars and their bands were of silver.
Exodus	Exo	2	38	11	For the north side there were one hundred cubits; their twenty pillars and their twenty sockets were of bronze, the hooks of the pillars and their bands were of silver.
Exodus	Exo	2	38	12	For the west side there were hangings of fifty cubits with their ten pillars and their ten sockets; the hooks of the pillars and their bands were of silver.
Exodus	Exo	2	38	13	For the east side fifty cubits.
Exodus	Exo	2	38	14	The hangings for the one side of the gate were fifteen cubits, with their three pillars and their three sockets,
Exodus	Exo	2	38	15	and so for the other side. On both sides of the gate of the court were hangings of fifteen cubits, with their three pillars and their three sockets.
Exodus	Exo	2	38	16	All the hangings of the court all around were of fine twisted linen.
Exodus	Exo	2	38	17	The sockets for the pillars were of bronze, the hooks of the pillars and their bands, of silver; and the overlaying of their tops, of silver, and all the pillars of the court were furnished with silver bands.
Exodus	Exo	2	38	18	The screen of the gate of the court was the work of the weaver, of blue and purple and scarlet material and fine twisted linen. And the length was twenty cubits and the height was five cubits, corresponding to the hangings of the court.
Exodus	Exo	2	38	19	Their four pillars and their four sockets were of bronze; their hooks were of silver, and the overlaying of their tops and their bands were of silver.
Exodus	Exo	2	38	20	All the pegs of the tabernacle and of the court all around were of bronze.
Exodus	Exo	2	38	21	This is the number of the things for the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the testimony, as they were numbered according to the command of Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
Exodus	Exo	2	38	22	Now Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the LORD had commanded Moses.
Exodus	Exo	2	38	23	With him was Oholiab the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver and a skillful workman and a weaver in blue and in purple and in scarlet material, and fine linen.
Exodus	Exo	2	38	24	All the gold that was used for the work, in all the work of the sanctuary, even the gold of the wave offering, was talents and 730 shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary.
Exodus	Exo	2	38	25	The silver of those of the congregation who were numbered was talents and 1,775 shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary;
Exodus	Exo	2	38	26	a beka a head (that is, half a shekel according to the shekel of the sanctuary), for each one who passed over to those who were numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for 603,men.
Exodus	Exo	2	38	27	The hundred talents of silver were for casting the sockets of the sanctuary and the sockets of the veil; one hundred sockets for the hundred talents, a talent for a socket.
Exodus	Exo	2	38	28	Of the 1,shekels, he made hooks for the pillars and overlaid their tops and made bands for them.
Exodus	Exo	2	38	29	The bronze of the wave offering was talents and 2,400 shekels.
Exodus	Exo	2	38	30	With it he made the sockets to the doorway of the tent of meeting, and the bronze altar and its bronze grating, and all the utensils of the altar,
Exodus	Exo	2	38	31	and the sockets of the court all around and the sockets of the gate of the court, and all the pegs of the tabernacle and all the pegs of the court all around.
Exodus	Exo	2	39	1	Moreover, from the blue and purple and scarlet material, they made finely woven garments for ministering in the holy place as well as the holy garments which were for Aaron, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Exodus	Exo	2	39	2	He made the ephod of gold, and of blue and purple and scarlet material, and fine twisted linen.
Exodus	Exo	2	39	3	Then they hammered out gold sheets and cut them into threads to be woven in with the blue and the purple and the scarlet material, and the fine linen, the work of a skillful workman.
Exodus	Exo	2	39	4	They made attaching shoulder pieces for the ephod; it was attached at its two upper ends.
Exodus	Exo	2	39	5	The skillfully woven band which was on it was like its workmanship, of the same material: of gold and of blue and purple and scarlet material, and fine twisted linen, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Exodus	Exo	2	39	6	They made the onyx stones, set in gold filigree settings; they were engraved like the engravings of a signet, according to the names of the sons of Israel.
Exodus	Exo	2	39	7	And he placed them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod, as memorial stones for the sons of Israel, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Exodus	Exo	2	39	8	He made the breastpiece, the work of a skillful workman, like the workmanship of the ephod: of gold and of blue and purple and scarlet material and fine twisted linen.
Exodus	Exo	2	39	9	It was square; they made the breastpiece folded double, a span long and a span wide when folded double.
Exodus	Exo	2	39	10	And they mounted four rows of stones on it. The first row was a row of ruby, topaz, and emerald;
Exodus	Exo	2	39	11	and the second row, a turquoise, a sapphire and a diamond;
Exodus	Exo	2	39	12	and the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;
Exodus	Exo	2	39	13	and the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper. They were set in gold filigree settings when they were mounted.
Exodus	Exo	2	39	14	The stones were corresponding to the names of the sons of Israel; they were twelve, corresponding to their names, engraved with the engravings of a signet, each with its name for the twelve tribes.
Exodus	Exo	2	39	15	They made on the breastpiece chains like cords, of twisted cordage work in pure gold.
Exodus	Exo	2	39	16	They made two gold filigree settings and two gold rings, and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastpiece.
Exodus	Exo	2	39	17	Then they put the two gold cords in the two rings at the ends of the breastpiece.
Exodus	Exo	2	39	18	They put the other two ends of the two cords on the two filigree settings, and put them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front of it.
Exodus	Exo	2	39	19	They made two gold rings and placed them on the two ends of the breastpiece, on its inner edge which was next to the ephod.
Exodus	Exo	2	39	20	Furthermore, they made two gold rings and placed them on the bottom of the two shoulder pieces of the ephod, on the front of it, close to the place where it joined, above the woven band of the ephod.
Exodus	Exo	2	39	21	They bound the breastpiece by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a blue cord, so that it would be on the woven band of the ephod, and that the breastpiece would not come loose from the ephod, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Exodus	Exo	2	39	22	Then he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue;
Exodus	Exo	2	39	23	and the opening of the robe was at the top in the center, as the opening of a coat of mail, with a binding all around its opening, so that it would not be torn.
Exodus	Exo	2	39	24	They made pomegranates of blue and purple and scarlet material and twisted linen on the hem of the robe.
Exodus	Exo	2	39	25	They also made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates all around on the hem of the robe,
Exodus	Exo	2	39	26	alternating a bell and a pomegranate all around on the hem of the robe for the service, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Exodus	Exo	2	39	27	They made the tunics of finely woven linen for Aaron and his sons,
Exodus	Exo	2	39	28	and the turban of fine linen, and the decorated caps of fine linen, and the linen breeches of fine twisted linen,
Exodus	Exo	2	39	29	and the sash of fine twisted linen, and blue and purple and scarlet material, the work of the weaver, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Exodus	Exo	2	39	30	They made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and inscribed it like the engravings of a signet, "Holy to the LORD."
Exodus	Exo	2	39	31	They fastened a blue cord to it, to fasten it on the turban above, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Exodus	Exo	2	39	32	Thus all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting was completed; and the sons of Israel did according to all that the LORD had commanded Moses; so they did.
Exodus	Exo	2	39	33	They brought the tabernacle to Moses, the tent and all its furnishings: its clasps, its boards, its bars, and its pillars and its sockets;
Exodus	Exo	2	39	34	and the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of porpoise skins, and the screening veil;
Exodus	Exo	2	39	35	the ark of the testimony and its poles and the mercy seat;
Exodus	Exo	2	39	36	the table, all its utensils, and the bread of the Presence;
Exodus	Exo	2	39	37	the pure gold lampstand, with its arrangement of lamps and all its utensils, and the oil for the light;
Exodus	Exo	2	39	38	and the gold altar, and the anointing oil and the fragrant incense, and the veil for the doorway of the tent;
Exodus	Exo	2	39	39	the bronze altar and its bronze grating, its poles and all its utensils, the laver and its stand;
Exodus	Exo	2	39	40	the hangings for the court, its pillars and its sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court, its cords and its pegs and all the equipment for the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting;
Exodus	Exo	2	39	41	the woven garments for ministering in the holy place and the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons, to minister as priests.
Exodus	Exo	2	39	42	So the sons of Israel did all the work according to all that the LORD had commanded Moses.
Exodus	Exo	2	39	43	And Moses examined all the work and behold, they had done it; just as the LORD had commanded, this they had done. So Moses blessed them.
Exodus	Exo	2	40	1	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Exodus	Exo	2	40	2	"On the first day of the first month you shall set up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.
Exodus	Exo	2	40	3	"You shall place the ark of the testimony there, and you shall screen the ark with the veil.
Exodus	Exo	2	40	4	"You shall bring in the table and arrange what belongs on it; and you shall bring in the lampstand and mount its lamps.
Exodus	Exo	2	40	5	"Moreover, you shall set the gold altar of incense before the ark of the testimony, and set up the veil for the doorway to the tabernacle.
Exodus	Exo	2	40	6	"You shall set the altar of burnt offering in front of the doorway of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.
Exodus	Exo	2	40	7	"You shall set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it.
Exodus	Exo	2	40	8	"You shall set up the court all around and hang up the veil for the gateway of the court.
Exodus	Exo	2	40	9	"Then you shall take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and all that is in it, and shall consecrate it and all its furnishings; and it shall be holy.
Exodus	Exo	2	40	10	"You shall anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and consecrate the altar, and the altar shall be most holy.
Exodus	Exo	2	40	11	"You shall anoint the laver and its stand, and consecrate it.
Exodus	Exo	2	40	12	"Then you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the doorway of the tent of meeting and wash them with water.
Exodus	Exo	2	40	13	"You shall put the holy garments on Aaron and anoint him and consecrate him, that he may minister as a priest to Me.
Exodus	Exo	2	40	14	"You shall bring his sons and put tunics on them;
Exodus	Exo	2	40	15	and you shall anoint them even as you have anointed their father, that they may minister as priests to Me; and their anointing will qualify them for a perpetual priesthood throughout their generations."
Exodus	Exo	2	40	16	Thus Moses did; according to all that the LORD had commanded him, so he did.
Exodus	Exo	2	40	17	Now in the first month of the second year, on the first day of the month, the tabernacle was erected.
Exodus	Exo	2	40	18	Moses erected the tabernacle and laid its sockets, and set up its boards, and inserted its bars and erected its pillars.
Exodus	Exo	2	40	19	He spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering of the tent on top of it, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Exodus	Exo	2	40	20	Then he took the testimony and put it into the ark, and attached the poles to the ark, and put the mercy seat on top of the ark.
Exodus	Exo	2	40	21	He brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up a veil for the screen, and screened off the ark of the testimony, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Exodus	Exo	2	40	22	Then he put the table in the tent of meeting on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the veil.
Exodus	Exo	2	40	23	He set the arrangement of bread in order on it before the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Exodus	Exo	2	40	24	Then he placed the lampstand in the tent of meeting, opposite the table, on the south side of the tabernacle.
Exodus	Exo	2	40	25	He lighted the lamps before the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Exodus	Exo	2	40	26	Then he placed the gold altar in the tent of meeting in front of the veil;
Exodus	Exo	2	40	27	and he burned fragrant incense on it, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Exodus	Exo	2	40	28	Then he set up the veil for the doorway of the tabernacle.
Exodus	Exo	2	40	29	He set the altar of burnt offering before the doorway of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered on it the burnt offering and the meal offering, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Exodus	Exo	2	40	30	He placed the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing.
Exodus	Exo	2	40	31	From it Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet.
Exodus	Exo	2	40	32	When they entered the tent of meeting, and when they approached the altar, they washed, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Exodus	Exo	2	40	33	He erected the court all around the tabernacle and the altar, and hung up the veil for the gateway of the court. Thus Moses finished the work.
Exodus	Exo	2	40	34	Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
Exodus	Exo	2	40	35	Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting because the cloud had settled on it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
Exodus	Exo	2	40	36	Throughout all their journeys whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the sons of Israel would set out;
Exodus	Exo	2	40	37	but if the cloud was not taken up, then they did not set out until the day when it was taken up.
Exodus	Exo	2	40	38	For throughout all their journeys, the cloud of the LORD was on the tabernacle by day, and there was fire in it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel.
Leviticus	Lev	3	1	1	Then the LORD called to Moses and spoke to him from the tent of meeting, saying,
Leviticus	Lev	3	1	2	"Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'When any man of you brings an offering to the LORD, you shall bring your offering of animals from the herd or the flock.
Leviticus	Lev	3	1	3	'If his offering is a burnt offering from the herd, he shall offer it, a male without defect; he shall offer it at the doorway of the tent of meeting, that he may be accepted before the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	1	4	'He shall lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering, that it may be accepted for him to make atonement on his behalf.
Leviticus	Lev	3	1	5	'He shall slay the young bull before the LORD; and Aaron's sons the priests shall offer up the blood and sprinkle the blood around on the altar that is at the doorway of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus	Lev	3	1	6	'He shall then skin the burnt offering and cut it into its pieces.
Leviticus	Lev	3	1	7	'The sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar and arrange wood on the fire.
Leviticus	Lev	3	1	8	'Then Aaron's sons the priests shall arrange the pieces, the head and the suet over the wood which is on the fire that is on the altar.
Leviticus	Lev	3	1	9	'Its entrails, however, and its legs he shall wash with water. And the priest shall offer up in smoke all of it on the altar for a burnt offering, an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	1	10	'But if his offering is from the flock, of the sheep or of the goats, for a burnt offering, he shall offer it a male without defect.
Leviticus	Lev	3	1	11	'He shall slay it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD, and Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle its blood around on the altar.
Leviticus	Lev	3	1	12	'He shall then cut it into its pieces with its head and its suet, and the priest shall arrange them on the wood which is on the fire that is on the altar.
Leviticus	Lev	3	1	13	'The entrails, however, and the legs he shall wash with water. And the priest shall offer all of it, and offer it up in smoke on the altar; it is a burnt offering, an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	1	14	'But if his offering to the LORD is a burnt offering of birds, then he shall bring his offering from the turtledoves or from young pigeons.
Leviticus	Lev	3	1	15	'The priest shall bring it to the altar, and wring off its head and offer it up in smoke on the altar; and its blood is to be drained out on the side of the altar.
Leviticus	Lev	3	1	16	'He shall also take away its crop with its feathers and cast it beside the altar eastward, to the place of the ashes.
Leviticus	Lev	3	1	17	'Then he shall tear it by its wings, but shall not sever it. And the priest shall offer it up in smoke on the altar on the wood which is on the fire; it is a burnt offering, an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	2	1	'Now when anyone presents a grain offering as an offering to the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour, and he shall pour oil on it and put frankincense on it.
Leviticus	Lev	3	2	2	'He shall then bring it to Aaron's sons the priests; and shall take from it his handful of its fine flour and of its oil with all of its frankincense. And the priest shall offer it up in smoke as its memorial portion on the altar, an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	2	3	'The remainder of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons: a thing most holy, of the offerings to the LORD by fire.
Leviticus	Lev	3	2	4	'Now when you bring an offering of a grain offering baked in an oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, or unleavened wafers spread with oil.
Leviticus	Lev	3	2	5	'If your offering is a grain offering made on the griddle, it shall be of fine flour, unleavened, mixed with oil;
Leviticus	Lev	3	2	6	you shall break it into bits and pour oil on it; it is a grain offering.
Leviticus	Lev	3	2	7	'Now if your offering is a grain offering made in a pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil.
Leviticus	Lev	3	2	8	'When you bring in the grain offering which is made of these things to the LORD, it shall be presented to the priest and he shall bring it to the altar.
Leviticus	Lev	3	2	9	'The priest then shall take up from the grain offering its memorial portion, and shall offer it up in smoke on the altar as an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	2	10	'The remainder of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons: a thing most holy of the offerings to the LORD by fire.
Leviticus	Lev	3	2	11	'No grain offering, which you bring to the LORD, shall be made with leaven, for you shall not offer up in smoke any leaven or any honey as an offering by fire to the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	2	12	'As an offering of first fruits you shall bring them to the LORD, but they shall not ascend for a soothing aroma on the altar.
Leviticus	Lev	3	2	13	'Every grain offering of yours, moreover, you shall season with salt, so that the salt of the covenant of your God shall not be lacking from your grain offering; with all your offerings you shall offer salt.
Leviticus	Lev	3	2	14	'Also if you bring a grain offering of early ripened things to the LORD, you shall bring fresh heads of grain roasted in the fire, grits of new growth, for the grain offering of your early ripened things.
Leviticus	Lev	3	2	15	'You shall then put oil on it and lay incense on it; it is a grain offering.
Leviticus	Lev	3	2	16	'The priest shall offer up in smoke its memorial portion, part of its grits and its oil with all its incense as an offering by fire to the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	3	1	'Now if his offering is a sacrifice of peace offerings, if he is going to offer out of the herd, whether male or female, he shall offer it without defect before the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	3	2	'He shall lay his hand on the head of his offering and slay it at the doorway of the tent of meeting, and Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood around on the altar.
Leviticus	Lev	3	3	3	'From the sacrifice of the peace offerings he shall present an offering by fire to the LORD, the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails,
Leviticus	Lev	3	3	4	and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, which is on the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys.
Leviticus	Lev	3	3	5	'Then Aaron's sons shall offer it up in smoke on the altar on the burnt offering, which is on the wood that is on the fire; it is an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	3	6	'But if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD is from the flock, he shall offer it, male or female, without defect.
Leviticus	Lev	3	3	7	'If he is going to offer a lamb for his offering, then he shall offer it before the LORD,

Leviticus	Lev	3	3	9	'From the sacrifice of peace offerings he shall bring as an offering by fire to the LORD, its fat, the entire fat tail which he shall remove close to the backbone, and the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails,
Leviticus	Lev	3	3	10	and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, which is on the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys.
Leviticus	Lev	3	3	11	'Then the priest shall offer it up in smoke on the altar as food, an offering by fire to the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	3	12	'Moreover, if his offering is a goat, then he shall offer it before the LORD,
Leviticus	Lev	3	3	13	and he shall lay his hand on its head and slay it before the tent of meeting, and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle its blood around on the altar.
Leviticus	Lev	3	3	14	'From it he shall present his offering as an offering by fire to the LORD, the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails,
Leviticus	Lev	3	3	15	and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, which is on the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys.
Leviticus	Lev	3	3	16	'The priest shall offer them up in smoke on the altar as food, an offering by fire for a soothing aroma; all fat is the LORD'S.
Leviticus	Lev	3	3	17	'It is a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings: you shall not eat any fat or any blood.'"
Leviticus	Lev	3	4	1	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus	Lev	3	4	2	"Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'If a person sins unintentionally in any of the things which the LORD has commanded not to be done, and commits any of them,
Leviticus	Lev	3	4	3	if the anointed priest sins so as to bring guilt on the people, then let him offer to the LORD a bull without defect as a sin offering for the sin he has committed.
Leviticus	Lev	3	4	4	'He shall bring the bull to the doorway of the tent of meeting before the LORD, and he shall lay his hand on the head of the bull and slay the bull before the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	4	5	'Then the anointed priest is to take some of the blood of the bull and bring it to the tent of meeting,
Leviticus	Lev	3	4	6	and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle some of the blood seven times before the LORD, in front of the veil of the sanctuary.
Leviticus	Lev	3	4	7	'The priest shall also put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of fragrant incense which is before the LORD in the tent of meeting; and all the blood of the bull he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering which is at the doorway of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus	Lev	3	4	8	'He shall remove from it all the fat of the bull of the sin offering: the fat that covers the entrails, and all the fat which is on the entrails,
Leviticus	Lev	3	4	9	and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, which is on the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys
Leviticus	Lev	3	4	10	(just as it is removed from the ox of the sacrifice of peace offerings), and the priest is to offer them up in smoke on the altar of burnt offering.
Leviticus	Lev	3	4	11	'But the hide of the bull and all its flesh with its head and its legs and its entrails and its refuse,
Leviticus	Lev	3	4	12	that is, all the rest of the bull, he is to bring out to a clean place outside the camp where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire; where the ashes are poured out it shall be burned.
Leviticus	Lev	3	4	13	'Now if the whole congregation of Israel commits error and the matter escapes the notice of the assembly, and they commit any of the things which the LORD has commanded not to be done, and they become guilty;
Leviticus	Lev	3	4	14	when the sin which they have committed becomes known, then the assembly shall offer a bull of the herd for a sin offering and bring it before the tent of meeting.
Leviticus	Lev	3	4	15	'Then the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands on the head of the bull before the LORD, and the bull shall be slain before the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	4	16	'Then the anointed priest is to bring some of the blood of the bull to the tent of meeting;
Leviticus	Lev	3	4	17	and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, in front of the veil.

Leviticus	Lev	3	4	19	'He shall remove all its fat from it and offer it up in smoke on the altar.
Leviticus	Lev	3	4	20	'He shall also do with the bull just as he did with the bull of the sin offering; thus he shall do with it. So the priest shall make atonement for them, and they will be forgiven.
Leviticus	Lev	3	4	21	'Then he is to bring out the bull to a place outside the camp and burn it as he burned the first bull; it is the sin offering for the assembly.
Leviticus	Lev	3	4	22	'When a leader sins and unintentionally does any one of all the things which the LORD his God has commanded not to be done, and he becomes guilty,
Leviticus	Lev	3	4	23	if his sin which he has committed is made known to him, he shall bring for his offering a goat, a male without defect.
Leviticus	Lev	3	4	24	'He shall lay his hand on the head of the male goat and slay it in the place where they slay the burnt offering before the LORD; it is a sin offering.
Leviticus	Lev	3	4	25	'Then the priest is to take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering; and the rest of its blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering.
Leviticus	Lev	3	4	26	'All its fat he shall offer up in smoke on the altar as in the case of the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him in regard to his sin, and he will be forgiven.
Leviticus	Lev	3	4	27	'Now if anyone of the common people sins unintentionally in doing any of the things which the LORD has commanded not to be done, and becomes guilty,
Leviticus	Lev	3	4	28	if his sin which he has committed is made known to him, then he shall bring for his offering a goat, a female without defect, for his sin which he has committed.
Leviticus	Lev	3	4	29	'He shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slay the sin offering at the place of the burnt offering.
Leviticus	Lev	3	4	30	'The priest shall take some of its blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering; and all the rest of its blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar.
Leviticus	Lev	3	4	31	'Then he shall remove all its fat, just as the fat was removed from the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall offer it up in smoke on the altar for a soothing aroma to the LORD. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him, and he will be forgiven.
Leviticus	Lev	3	4	32	'But if he brings a lamb as his offering for a sin offering, he shall bring it, a female without defect.
Leviticus	Lev	3	4	33	'He shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slay it for a sin offering in the place where they slay the burnt offering.
Leviticus	Lev	3	4	34	'The priest is to take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and all the rest of its blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar.
Leviticus	Lev	3	4	35	'Then he shall remove all its fat, just as the fat of the lamb is removed from the sacrifice of the peace offerings, and the priest shall offer them up in smoke on the altar, on the offerings by fire to the LORD. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him in regard to his sin which he has committed, and he will be forgiven.
Leviticus	Lev	3	5	1	'Now if a person sins after he hears a public adjuration to testify when he is a witness, whether he has seen or otherwise known, if he does not tell it, then he will bear his guilt.
Leviticus	Lev	3	5	2	'Or if a person touches any unclean thing, whether a carcass of an unclean beast or the carcass of unclean cattle or a carcass of unclean swarming things, though it is hidden from him and he is unclean, then he will be guilty.
Leviticus	Lev	3	5	3	'Or if he touches human uncleanness, of whatever sort his uncleanness may be with which he becomes unclean, and it is hidden from him, and then he comes to know it, he will be guilty.
Leviticus	Lev	3	5	4	'Or if a person swears thoughtlessly with his lips to do evil or to do good, in whatever matter a man may speak thoughtlessly with an oath, and it is hidden from him, and then he comes to know it, he will be guilty in one of these.
Leviticus	Lev	3	5	5	'So it shall be when he becomes guilty in one of these, that he shall confess that in which he has sinned.
Leviticus	Lev	3	5	6	'He shall also bring his guilt offering to the LORD for his sin which he has committed, a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat as a sin offering. So the priest shall make atonement on his behalf for his sin.
Leviticus	Lev	3	5	7	'But if he cannot afford a lamb, then he shall bring to the LORD his guilt offering for that in which he has sinned, two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering.
Leviticus	Lev	3	5	8	'He shall bring them to the priest, who shall offer first that which is for the sin offering and shall nip its head at the front of its neck, but he shall not sever it.
Leviticus	Lev	3	5	9	'He shall also sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar, while the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar: it is a sin offering.
Leviticus	Lev	3	5	10	'The second he shall then prepare as a burnt offering according to the ordinance. So the priest shall make atonement on his behalf for his sin which he has committed, and it will be forgiven him.
Leviticus	Lev	3	5	11	'But if his means are insufficient for two turtledoves or two young pigeons, then for his offering for that which he has sinned, he shall bring the tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall not put oil on it or place incense on it, for it is a sin offering.
Leviticus	Lev	3	5	12	'He shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it as its memorial portion and offer it up in smoke on the altar, with the offerings of the LORD by fire: it is a sin offering.
Leviticus	Lev	3	5	13	'So the priest shall make atonement for him concerning his sin which he has committed from one of these, and it will be forgiven him; then the rest shall become the priest's, like the grain offering.'"
Leviticus	Lev	3	5	14	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus	Lev	3	5	15	"If a person acts unfaithfully and sins unintentionally against the LORD'S holy things, then he shall bring his guilt offering to the LORD: a ram without defect from the flock, according to your valuation in silver by shekels, in terms of the shekel of the sanctuary, for a guilt offering.
Leviticus	Lev	3	5	16	"He shall make restitution for that which he has sinned against the holy thing, and shall add to it a fifth part of it and give it to the priest. The priest shall then make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering, and it will be forgiven him.
Leviticus	Lev	3	5	17	"Now if a person sins and does any of the things which the LORD has commanded not to be done, though he was unaware, still he is guilty and shall bear his punishment.
Leviticus	Lev	3	5	18	"He is then to bring to the priest a ram without defect from the flock, according to your valuation, for a guilt offering. So the priest shall make atonement for him concerning his error in which he sinned unintentionally and did not know it, and it will be forgiven him.
Leviticus	Lev	3	5	19	"It is a guilt offering; he was certainly guilty before the LORD."
Leviticus	Lev	3	6	1	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus	Lev	3	6	2	"When a person sins and acts unfaithfully against the LORD, and deceives his companion in regard to a deposit or a security entrusted to him, or through robbery, or if he has extorted from his companion,
Leviticus	Lev	3	6	3	or has found what was lost and lied about it and sworn falsely, so that he sins in regard to any one of the things a man may do;
Leviticus	Lev	3	6	4	then it shall be, when he sins and becomes guilty, that he shall restore what he took by robbery or what he got by extortion, or the deposit which was entrusted to him or the lost thing which he found,
Leviticus	Lev	3	6	5	or anything about which he swore falsely; he shall make restitution for it in full and add to it one-fifth more. He shall give it to the one to whom it belongs on the day he presents his guilt offering.
Leviticus	Lev	3	6	6	"Then he shall bring to the priest his guilt offering to the LORD, a ram without defect from the flock, according to your valuation, for a guilt offering,
Leviticus	Lev	3	6	7	and the priest shall make atonement for him before the LORD, and he will be forgiven for any one of the things which he may have done to incur guilt."
Leviticus	Lev	3	6	8	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus	Lev	3	6	9	"Command Aaron and his sons, saying, 'This is the law for the burnt offering: the burnt offering itself shall remain on the hearth on the altar all night until the morning, and the fire on the altar is to be kept burning on it.
Leviticus	Lev	3	6	10	'The priest is to put on his linen robe, and he shall put on undergarments next to his flesh; and he shall take up the ashes to which the fire reduces the burnt offering on the altar and place them beside the altar.
Leviticus	Lev	3	6	11	'Then he shall take off his garments and put on other garments, and carry the ashes outside the camp to a clean place.
Leviticus	Lev	3	6	12	'The fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it. It shall not go out, but the priest shall burn wood on it every morning; and he shall lay out the burnt offering on it, and offer up in smoke the fat portions of the peace offerings on it.
Leviticus	Lev	3	6	13	'Fire shall be kept burning continually on the altar; it is not to go out.
Leviticus	Lev	3	6	14	'Now this is the law of the grain offering: the sons of Aaron shall present it before the LORD in front of the altar.
Leviticus	Lev	3	6	15	'Then one of them shall lift up from it a handful of the fine flour of the grain offering, with its oil and all the incense that is on the grain offering, and he shall offer it up in smoke on the altar, a soothing aroma, as its memorial offering to the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	6	16	'What is left of it Aaron and his sons are to eat. It shall be eaten as unleavened cakes in a holy place; they are to eat it in the court of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus	Lev	3	6	17	'It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it as their share from My offerings by fire; it is most holy, like the sin offering and the guilt offering.
Leviticus	Lev	3	6	18	'Every male among the sons of Aaron may eat it; it is a permanent ordinance throughout your generations, from the offerings by fire to the LORD. Whoever touches them will become consecrated.'"
Leviticus	Lev	3	6	19	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus	Lev	3	6	20	"This is the offering which Aaron and his sons are to present to the LORD on the day when he is anointed; the tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a regular grain offering, half of it in the morning and half of it in the evening.
Leviticus	Lev	3	6	21	"It shall be prepared with oil on a griddle. When it is well stirred, you shall bring it. You shall present the grain offering in baked pieces as a soothing aroma to the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	6	22	"The anointed priest who will be in his place among his sons shall offer it. By a permanent ordinance it shall be entirely offered up in smoke to the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	6	23	"So every grain offering of the priest shall be burned entirely. It shall not be eaten."
Leviticus	Lev	3	6	24	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus	Lev	3	6	25	"Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, 'This is the law of the sin offering: in the place where the burnt offering is slain the sin offering shall be slain before the LORD; it is most holy.
Leviticus	Lev	3	6	26	'The priest who offers it for sin shall eat it. It shall be eaten in a holy place, in the court of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus	Lev	3	6	27	'Anyone who touches its flesh will become consecrated; and when any of its blood splashes on a garment, in a holy place you shall wash what was splashed on.
Leviticus	Lev	3	6	28	'Also the earthenware vessel in which it was boiled shall be broken; and if it was boiled in a bronze vessel, then it shall be scoured and rinsed in water.
Leviticus	Lev	3	6	29	'Every male among the priests may eat of it; it is most holy.
Leviticus	Lev	3	6	30	'But no sin offering of which any of the blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the holy place shall be eaten; it shall be burned with fire.
Leviticus	Lev	3	7	1	'Now this is the law of the guilt offering; it is most holy.
Leviticus	Lev	3	7	2	'In the place where they slay the burnt offering they are to slay the guilt offering, and he shall sprinkle its blood around on the altar.
Leviticus	Lev	3	7	3	'Then he shall offer from it all its fat: the fat tail and the fat that covers the entrails,
Leviticus	Lev	3	7	4	and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, which is on the loins, and the lobe on the liver he shall remove with the kidneys.

Leviticus	Lev	3	7	6	'Every male among the priests may eat of it. It shall be eaten in a holy place; it is most holy.
Leviticus	Lev	3	7	7	'The guilt offering is like the sin offering, there is one law for them; the priest who makes atonement with it shall have it.
Leviticus	Lev	3	7	8	'Also the priest who presents any man's burnt offering, that priest shall have for himself the skin of the burnt offering which he has presented.
Leviticus	Lev	3	7	9	'Likewise, every grain offering that is baked in the oven and everything prepared in a pan or on a griddle shall belong to the priest who presents it.
Leviticus	Lev	3	7	10	'Every grain offering, mixed with oil or dry, shall belong to all the sons of Aaron, to all alike.
Leviticus	Lev	3	7	11	'Now this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings which shall be presented to the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	7	12	'If he offers it by way of thanksgiving, then along with the sacrifice of thanksgiving he shall offer unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil, and cakes of well stirred fine flour mixed with oil.
Leviticus	Lev	3	7	13	'With the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving, he shall present his offering with cakes of leavened bread.
Leviticus	Lev	3	7	14	'Of this he shall present one of every offering as a contribution to the LORD; it shall belong to the priest who sprinkles the blood of the peace offerings.
Leviticus	Lev	3	7	15	'Now as for the flesh of the sacrifice of his thanksgiving peace offerings, it shall be eaten on the day of his offering; he shall not leave any of it over until morning.
Leviticus	Lev	3	7	16	'But if the sacrifice of his offering is a votive or a freewill offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he offers his sacrifice, and on the next day what is left of it may be eaten;
Leviticus	Lev	3	7	17	but what is left over from the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burned with fire.
Leviticus	Lev	3	7	18	'So if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings should ever be eaten on the third day, he who offers it will not be accepted, and it will not be reckoned to his benefit. It shall be an offensive thing, and the person who eats of it will bear his own iniquity.
Leviticus	Lev	3	7	19	'Also the flesh that touches anything unclean shall not be eaten; it shall be burned with fire. As for other flesh, anyone who is clean may eat such flesh.
Leviticus	Lev	3	7	20	'But the person who eats the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings which belong to the LORD, in his uncleanness, that person shall be cut off from his people.
Leviticus	Lev	3	7	21	'When anyone touches anything unclean, whether human uncleanness, or an unclean animal, or any unclean detestable thing, and eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings which belong to the LORD, that person shall be cut off from his people.'"
Leviticus	Lev	3	7	22	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus	Lev	3	7	23	"Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'You shall not eat any fat from an ox, a sheep or a goat.
Leviticus	Lev	3	7	24	'Also the fat of an animal which dies and the fat of an animal torn by beasts may be put to any other use, but you must certainly not eat it.
Leviticus	Lev	3	7	25	'For whoever eats the fat of the animal from which an offering by fire is offered to the LORD, even the person who eats shall be cut off from his people.
Leviticus	Lev	3	7	26	'You are not to eat any blood, either of bird or animal, in any of your dwellings.
Leviticus	Lev	3	7	27	'Any person who eats any blood, even that person shall be cut off from his people.'"
Leviticus	Lev	3	7	28	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus	Lev	3	7	29	"Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'He who offers the sacrifice of his peace offerings to the LORD shall bring his offering to the LORD from the sacrifice of his peace offerings.
Leviticus	Lev	3	7	30	'His own hands are to bring offerings by fire to the LORD. He shall bring the fat with the breast, that the breast may be presented as a wave offering before the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	7	31	'The priest shall offer up the fat in smoke on the altar, but the breast shall belong to Aaron and his sons.
Leviticus	Lev	3	7	32	'You shall give the right thigh to the priest as a contribution from the sacrifices of your peace offerings.
Leviticus	Lev	3	7	33	'The one among the sons of Aaron who offers the blood of the peace offerings and the fat, the right thigh shall be his as his portion.
Leviticus	Lev	3	7	34	'For I have taken the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution from the sons of Israel from the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons as their due forever from the sons of Israel.
Leviticus	Lev	3	7	35	'This is that which is consecrated to Aaron and that which is consecrated to his sons from the offerings by fire to the LORD, in that day when he presented them to serve as priests to the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	7	36	'These the LORD had commanded to be given them from the sons of Israel in the day that He anointed them. It is their due forever throughout their generations.'"
Leviticus	Lev	3	7	37	This is the law of the burnt offering, the grain offering and the sin offering and the guilt offering and the ordination offering and the sacrifice of peace offerings,
Leviticus	Lev	3	7	38	which the LORD commanded Moses at Mount Sinai in the day that He commanded the sons of Israel to present their offerings to the LORD in the wilderness of Sinai.
Leviticus	Lev	3	8	1	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus	Lev	3	8	2	"Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments and the anointing oil and the bull of the sin offering, and the two rams and the basket of unleavened bread,
Leviticus	Lev	3	8	3	and assemble all the congregation at the doorway of the tent of meeting."
Leviticus	Lev	3	8	4	So Moses did just as the LORD commanded him. When the congregation was assembled at the doorway of the tent of meeting,
Leviticus	Lev	3	8	5	Moses said to the congregation, "This is the thing which the LORD has commanded to do."
Leviticus	Lev	3	8	6	Then Moses had Aaron and his sons come near and washed them with water.
Leviticus	Lev	3	8	7	He put the tunic on him and girded him with the sash, and clothed him with the robe and put the ephod on him; and he girded him with the artistic band of the ephod, with which he tied it to him.
Leviticus	Lev	3	8	8	He then placed the breastpiece on him, and in the breastpiece he put the Urim and the Thummim.
Leviticus	Lev	3	8	9	He also placed the turban on his head, and on the turban, at its front, he placed the golden plate, the holy crown, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Leviticus	Lev	3	8	10	Moses then took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it, and consecrated them.
Leviticus	Lev	3	8	11	He sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times and anointed the altar and all its utensils, and the basin and its stand, to consecrate them.
Leviticus	Lev	3	8	12	Then he poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron's head and anointed him, to consecrate him.
Leviticus	Lev	3	8	13	Next Moses had Aaron's sons come near and clothed them with tunics, and girded them with sashes and bound caps on them, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Leviticus	Lev	3	8	14	Then he brought the bull of the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering.
Leviticus	Lev	3	8	15	Next Moses slaughtered it and took the blood and with his finger put some of it around on the horns of the altar, and purified the altar. Then he poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar and consecrated it, to make atonement for it.
Leviticus	Lev	3	8	16	He also took all the fat that was on the entrails and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat; and Moses offered it up in smoke on the altar.
Leviticus	Lev	3	8	17	But the bull and its hide and its flesh and its refuse he burned in the fire outside the camp, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Leviticus	Lev	3	8	18	Then he presented the ram of the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.
Leviticus	Lev	3	8	19	Moses slaughtered it and sprinkled the blood around on the altar.
Leviticus	Lev	3	8	20	When he had cut the ram into its pieces, Moses offered up the head and the pieces and the suet in smoke.
Leviticus	Lev	3	8	21	After he had washed the entrails and the legs with water, Moses offered up the whole ram in smoke on the altar. It was a burnt offering for a soothing aroma; it was an offering by fire to the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Leviticus	Lev	3	8	22	Then he presented the second ram, the ram of ordination, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.
Leviticus	Lev	3	8	23	Moses slaughtered it and took some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aaron's right ear, and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.
Leviticus	Lev	3	8	24	He also had Aaron's sons come near; and Moses put some of the blood on the lobe of their right ear, and on the thumb of their right hand and on the big toe of their right foot. Moses then sprinkled the rest of the blood around on the altar.
Leviticus	Lev	3	8	25	He took the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that was on the entrails, and the lobe of the liver and the two kidneys and their fat and the right thigh.
Leviticus	Lev	3	8	26	From the basket of unleavened bread that was before the LORD, he took one unleavened cake and one cake of bread mixed with oil and one wafer, and placed them on the portions of fat and on the right thigh.
Leviticus	Lev	3	8	27	He then put all these on the hands of Aaron and on the hands of his sons and presented them as a wave offering before the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	8	28	Then Moses took them from their hands and offered them up in smoke on the altar with the burnt offering. They were an ordination offering for a soothing aroma; it was an offering by fire to the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	8	29	Moses also took the breast and presented it for a wave offering before the LORD; it was Moses' portion of the ram of ordination, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Leviticus	Lev	3	8	30	So Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood which was on the altar and sprinkled it on Aaron, on his garments, on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him; and he consecrated Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him.
Leviticus	Lev	3	8	31	Then Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, "Boil the flesh at the doorway of the tent of meeting, and eat it there together with the bread which is in the basket of the ordination offering, just as I commanded, saying, 'Aaron and his sons shall eat it.'
Leviticus	Lev	3	8	32	"The remainder of the flesh and of the bread you shall burn in the fire.
Leviticus	Lev	3	8	33	"You shall not go outside the doorway of the tent of meeting for seven days, until the day that the period of your ordination is fulfilled; for he will ordain you through seven days.
Leviticus	Lev	3	8	34	"The LORD has commanded to do as has been done this day, to make atonement on your behalf.
Leviticus	Lev	3	8	35	"At the doorway of the tent of meeting, moreover, you shall remain day and night for seven days and keep the charge of the LORD, so that you will not die, for so I have been commanded."
Leviticus	Lev	3	8	36	Thus Aaron and his sons did all the things which the LORD had commanded through Moses.
Leviticus	Lev	3	9	1	Now it came about on the eighth day that Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel;
Leviticus	Lev	3	9	2	and he said to Aaron, "Take for yourself a calf, a bull, for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, both without defect, and offer them before the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	9	3	"Then to the sons of Israel you shall speak, saying, 'Take a male goat for a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, both one year old, without defect, for a burnt offering,
Leviticus	Lev	3	9	4	and an ox and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD, and a grain offering mixed with oil; for today the LORD will appear to you.'"
Leviticus	Lev	3	9	5	So they took what Moses had commanded to the front of the tent of meeting, and the whole congregation came near and stood before the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	9	6	Moses said, "This is the thing which the LORD has commanded you to do, that the glory of the LORD may appear to you."
Leviticus	Lev	3	9	7	Moses then said to Aaron, "Come near to the altar and offer your sin offering and your burnt offering, that you may make atonement for yourself and for the people; then make the offering for the people, that you may make atonement for them, just as the LORD has commanded."
Leviticus	Lev	3	9	8	So Aaron came near to the altar and slaughtered the calf of the sin offering which was for himself.
Leviticus	Lev	3	9	9	Aaron's sons presented the blood to him; and he dipped his finger in the blood and put some on the horns of the altar, and poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
Leviticus	Lev	3	9	10	The fat and the kidneys and the lobe of the liver of the sin offering, he then offered up in smoke on the altar just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Leviticus	Lev	3	9	11	The flesh and the skin, however, he burned with fire outside the camp.
Leviticus	Lev	3	9	12	Then he slaughtered the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons handed the blood to him and he sprinkled it around on the altar.
Leviticus	Lev	3	9	13	They handed the burnt offering to him in pieces, with the head, and he offered them up in smoke on the altar.
Leviticus	Lev	3	9	14	He also washed the entrails and the legs, and offered them up in smoke with the burnt offering on the altar.
Leviticus	Lev	3	9	15	Then he presented the people's offering, and took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people, and slaughtered it and offered it for sin, like the first.
Leviticus	Lev	3	9	16	He also presented the burnt offering, and offered it according to the ordinance.
Leviticus	Lev	3	9	17	Next he presented the grain offering, and filled his hand with some of it and offered it up in smoke on the altar, besides the burnt offering of the morning.
Leviticus	Lev	3	9	18	Then he slaughtered the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings which was for the people; and Aaron's sons handed the blood to him and he sprinkled it around on the altar.
Leviticus	Lev	3	9	19	As for the portions of fat from the ox and from the ram, the fat tail, and the fat covering, and the kidneys and the lobe of the liver,
Leviticus	Lev	3	9	20	they now placed the portions of fat on the breasts; and he offered them up in smoke on the altar.
Leviticus	Lev	3	9	21	But the breasts and the right thigh Aaron presented as a wave offering before the LORD, just as Moses had commanded.
Leviticus	Lev	3	9	22	Then Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them, and he stepped down after making the sin offering and the burnt offering and the peace offerings.
Leviticus	Lev	3	9	23	Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting. When they came out and blessed the people, the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people.
Leviticus	Lev	3	9	24	Then fire came out from before the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and the portions of fat on the altar; and when all the people saw it, they shouted and fell on their faces.
Leviticus	Lev	3	10	1	Now Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took their respective firepans, and after putting fire in them, placed incense on it and offered strange fire before the LORD, which He had not commanded them.
Leviticus	Lev	3	10	2	And fire came out from the presence of the LORD and consumed them, and they died before the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	10	3	Then Moses said to Aaron, "It is what the LORD spoke, saying, 'By those who come near Me I will be treated as holy, And before all the people I will be honored.'" So Aaron, therefore, kept silent.
Leviticus	Lev	3	10	4	Moses called also to Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Aaron's uncle Uzziel, and said to them, "Come forward, carry your relatives away from the front of the sanctuary to the outside of the camp."
Leviticus	Lev	3	10	5	So they came forward and carried them still in their tunics to the outside of the camp, as Moses had said.
Leviticus	Lev	3	10	6	Then Moses said to Aaron and to his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, "Do not uncover your heads nor tear your clothes, so that you will not die and that He will not become wrathful against all the congregation. But your kinsmen, the whole house of Israel, shall bewail the burning which the LORD has brought about.
Leviticus	Lev	3	10	7	"You shall not even go out from the doorway of the tent of meeting, or you will die; for the LORD'S anointing oil is upon you." So they did according to the word of Moses.
Leviticus	Lev	3	10	8	The LORD then spoke to Aaron, saying,
Leviticus	Lev	3	10	9	"Do not drink wine or strong drink, neither you nor your sons with you, when you come into the tent of meeting, so that you will not die--it is a perpetual statute throughout your generations--
Leviticus	Lev	3	10	10	and so as to make a distinction between the holy and the profane, and between the unclean and the clean,
Leviticus	Lev	3	10	11	and so as to teach the sons of Israel all the statutes which the LORD has spoken to them through Moses."
Leviticus	Lev	3	10	12	Then Moses spoke to Aaron, and to his surviving sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, "Take the grain offering that is left over from the LORD'S offerings by fire and eat it unleavened beside the altar, for it is most holy.
Leviticus	Lev	3	10	13	"You shall eat it, moreover, in a holy place, because it is your due and your sons' due out of the LORD'S offerings by fire; for thus I have been commanded.
Leviticus	Lev	3	10	14	"The breast of the wave offering, however, and the thigh of the offering you may eat in a clean place, you and your sons and your daughters with you; for they have been given as your due and your sons' due out of the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the sons of Israel.
Leviticus	Lev	3	10	15	"The thigh offered by lifting up and the breast offered by waving they shall bring along with the offerings by fire of the portions of fat, to present as a wave offering before the LORD; so it shall be a thing perpetually due you and your sons with you, just as the LORD has commanded."
Leviticus	Lev	3	10	16	But Moses searched carefully for the goat of the sin offering, and behold, it had been burned up! So he was angry with Aaron's surviving sons Eleazar and Ithamar, saying,
Leviticus	Lev	3	10	17	"Why did you not eat the sin offering at the holy place? For it is most holy, and He gave it to you to bear away the guilt of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	10	18	"Behold, since its blood had not been brought inside, into the sanctuary, you should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary, just as I commanded."
Leviticus	Lev	3	10	19	But Aaron spoke to Moses, "Behold, this very day they presented their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD. When things like these happened to me, if I had eaten a sin offering today, would it have been good in the sight of the LORD?"
Leviticus	Lev	3	10	20	When Moses heard that, it seemed good in his sight.
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	1	The LORD spoke again to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them,
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	2	"Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'These are the creatures which you may eat from all the animals that are on the earth.
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	3	'Whatever divides a hoof, thus making split hoofs, and chews the cud, among the animals, that you may eat.
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	4	'Nevertheless, you are not to eat of these, among those which chew the cud, or among those which divide the hoof: the camel, for though it chews cud, it does not divide the hoof, it is unclean to you.
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	5	'Likewise, the shaphan, for though it chews cud, it does not divide the hoof, it is unclean to you;
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	6	the rabbit also, for though it chews cud, it does not divide the hoof, it is unclean to you;
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	7	and the pig, for though it divides the hoof, thus making a split hoof, it does not chew cud, it is unclean to you.
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	8	'You shall not eat of their flesh nor touch their carcasses; they are unclean to you.
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	9	'These you may eat, whatever is in the water: all that have fins and scales, those in the water, in the seas or in the rivers, you may eat.
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	10	'But whatever is in the seas and in the rivers that does not have fins and scales among all the teeming life of the water, and among all the living creatures that are in the water, they are detestable things to you,
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	11	and they shall be abhorrent to you; you may not eat of their flesh, and their carcasses you shall detest.
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	12	'Whatever in the water does not have fins and scales is abhorrent to you.
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	13	'These, moreover, you shall detest among the birds; they are abhorrent, not to be eaten: the eagle and the vulture and the buzzard,
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	14	and the kite and the falcon in its kind,
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	15	every raven in its kind,
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	16	and the ostrich and the owl and the sea gull and the hawk in its kind,
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	17	and the little owl and the cormorant and the great owl,
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	18	and the white owl and the pelican and the carrion vulture,
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	19	and the stork, the heron in its kinds, and the hoopoe, and the bat.
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	20	'All the winged insects that walk on all fours are detestable to you.
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	21	'Yet these you may eat among all the winged insects which walk on all fours: those which have above their feet jointed legs with which to jump on the earth.
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	22	'These of them you may eat: the locust in its kinds, and the devastating locust in its kinds, and the cricket in its kinds, and the grasshopper in its kinds.
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	23	'But all other winged insects which are four-footed are detestable to you.
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	24	'By these, moreover, you will be made unclean: whoever touches their carcasses becomes unclean until evening,
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	25	and whoever picks up any of their carcasses shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening.
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	26	'Concerning all the animals which divide the hoof but do not make a split hoof, or which do not chew cud, they are unclean to you: whoever touches them becomes unclean.
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	27	'Also whatever walks on its paws, among all the creatures that walk on all fours, are unclean to you; whoever touches their carcasses becomes unclean until evening,
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	28	and the one who picks up their carcasses shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening; they are unclean to you.
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	29	'Now these are to you the unclean among the swarming things which swarm on the earth: the mole, and the mouse, and the great lizard in its kinds,
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	30	and the gecko, and the crocodile, and the lizard, and the sand reptile, and the chameleon.
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	31	'These are to you the unclean among all the swarming things; whoever touches them when they are dead becomes unclean until evening.
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	32	'Also anything on which one of them may fall when they are dead becomes unclean, including any wooden article, or clothing, or a skin, or a sack--any article of which use is made--it shall be put in the water and be unclean until evening, then it becomes clean.
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	33	'As for any earthenware vessel into which one of them may fall, whatever is in it becomes unclean and you shall break the vessel.
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	34	'Any of the food which may be eaten, on which water comes, shall become unclean, and any liquid which may be drunk in every vessel shall become unclean.
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	35	'Everything, moreover, on which part of their carcass may fall becomes unclean; an oven or a stove shall be smashed; they are unclean and shall continue as unclean to you.
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	36	'Nevertheless a spring or a cistern collecting water shall be clean, though the one who touches their carcass shall be unclean.
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	37	'If a part of their carcass falls on any seed for sowing which is to be sown, it is clean.
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	38	'Though if water is put on the seed and a part of their carcass falls on it, it is unclean to you.
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	39	'Also if one of the animals dies which you have for food, the one who touches its carcass becomes unclean until evening.
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	40	'He too, who eats some of its carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening, and the one who picks up its carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening.
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	41	'Now every swarming thing that swarms on the earth is detestable, not to be eaten.
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	42	'Whatever crawls on its belly, and whatever walks on all fours, whatever has many feet, in respect to every swarming thing that swarms on the earth, you shall not eat them, for they are detestable.
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	43	'Do not render yourselves detestable through any of the swarming things that swarm; and you shall not make yourselves unclean with them so that you become unclean.
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	44	'For I am the LORD your God. Consecrate yourselves therefore, and be holy, for I am holy. And you shall not make yourselves unclean with any of the swarming things that swarm on the earth.
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	45	'For I am the LORD who brought you up from the land of Egypt to be your God; thus you shall be holy, for I am holy.'"
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	46	This is the law regarding the animal and the bird, and every living thing that moves in the waters and everything that swarms on the earth,
Leviticus	Lev	3	11	47	to make a distinction between the unclean and the clean, and between the edible creature and the creature which is not to be eaten.
Leviticus	Lev	3	12	1	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus	Lev	3	12	2	"Speak to the sons of Israel, saying: 'When a woman gives birth and bears a male child, then she shall be unclean for seven days, as in the days of her menstruation she shall be unclean.
Leviticus	Lev	3	12	3	'On the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.
Leviticus	Lev	3	12	4	'Then she shall remain in the blood of her purification for thirty-three days; she shall not touch any consecrated thing, nor enter the sanctuary until the days of her purification are completed.
Leviticus	Lev	3	12	5	'But if she bears a female child, then she shall be unclean for two weeks, as in her menstruation; and she shall remain in the blood of her purification for sixty-six days.
Leviticus	Lev	3	12	6	'When the days of her purification are completed, for a son or for a daughter, she shall bring to the priest at the doorway of the tent of meeting a one year old lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering.
Leviticus	Lev	3	12	7	'Then he shall offer it before the LORD and make atonement for her, and she shall be cleansed from the flow of her blood. This is the law for her who bears a child, whether a male or a female.
Leviticus	Lev	3	12	8	'But if she cannot afford a lamb, then she shall take two turtledoves or two young pigeons, the one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering; and the priest shall make atonement for her, and she will be clean.'"
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	1	Then the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	2	"When a man has on the skin of his body a swelling or a scab or a bright spot, and it becomes an infection of leprosy on the skin of his body, then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons the priests.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	3	"The priest shall look at the mark on the skin of the body, and if the hair in the infection has turned white and the infection appears to be deeper than the skin of his body, it is an infection of leprosy; when the priest has looked at him, he shall pronounce him unclean.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	4	"But if the bright spot is white on the skin of his body, and it does not appear to be deeper than the skin, and the hair on it has not turned white, then the priest shall isolate him who has the infection for seven days.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	5	"The priest shall look at him on the seventh day, and if in his eyes the infection has not changed and the infection has not spread on the skin, then the priest shall isolate him for seven more days.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	6	"The priest shall look at him again on the seventh day, and if the infection has faded and the mark has not spread on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; it is only a scab. And he shall wash his clothes and be clean.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	7	"But if the scab spreads farther on the skin after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall appear again to the priest.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	8	"The priest shall look, and if the scab has spread on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is leprosy.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	9	"When the infection of leprosy is on a man, then he shall be brought to the priest.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	10	"The priest shall then look, and if there is a white swelling in the skin, and it has turned the hair white, and there is quick raw flesh in the swelling,
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	11	it is a chronic leprosy on the skin of his body, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; he shall not isolate him, for he is unclean.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	12	"If the leprosy breaks out farther on the skin, and the leprosy covers all the skin of him who has the infection from his head even to his feet, as far as the priest can see,
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	13	then the priest shall look, and behold, if the leprosy has covered all his body, he shall pronounce clean him who has the infection; it has all turned white and he is clean.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	14	"But whenever raw flesh appears on him, he shall be unclean.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	15	"The priest shall look at the raw flesh, and he shall pronounce him unclean; the raw flesh is unclean, it is leprosy.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	16	"Or if the raw flesh turns again and is changed to white, then he shall come to the priest,
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	17	and the priest shall look at him, and behold, if the infection has turned to white, then the priest shall pronounce clean him who has the infection; he is clean.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	18	"When the body has a boil on its skin and it is healed,
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	19	and in the place of the boil there is a white swelling or a reddish-white, bright spot, then it shall be shown to the priest;
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	20	and the priest shall look, and behold, if it appears to be lower than the skin, and the hair on it has turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is the infection of leprosy, it has broken out in the boil.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	21	"But if the priest looks at it, and behold, there are no white hairs in it and it is not lower than the skin and is faded, then the priest shall isolate him for seven days;
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	22	and if it spreads farther on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an infection.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	23	"But if the bright spot remains in its place and does not spread, it is only the scar of the boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	24	"Or if the body sustains in its skin a burn by fire, and the raw flesh of the burn becomes a bright spot, reddish-white, or white,
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	25	then the priest shall look at it. And if the hair in the bright spot has turned white and it appears to be deeper than the skin, it is leprosy; it has broken out in the burn. Therefore, the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an infection of leprosy.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	26	"But if the priest looks at it, and indeed, there is no white hair in the bright spot and it is no deeper than the skin, but is dim, then the priest shall isolate him for seven days;
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	27	and the priest shall look at him on the seventh day. If it spreads farther in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an infection of leprosy.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	28	"But if the bright spot remains in its place and has not spread in the skin, but is dim, it is the swelling from the burn; and the priest shall pronounce him clean, for it is only the scar of the burn.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	29	"Now if a man or woman has an infection on the head or on the beard,
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	30	then the priest shall look at the infection, and if it appears to be deeper than the skin and there is thin yellowish hair in it, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a scale, it is leprosy of the head or of the beard.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	31	"But if the priest looks at the infection of the scale, and indeed, it appears to be no deeper than the skin and there is no black hair in it, then the priest shall isolate the person with the scaly infection for seven days.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	32	"On the seventh day the priest shall look at the infection, and if the scale has not spread and no yellowish hair has grown in it, and the appearance of the scale is no deeper than the skin,
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	33	then he shall shave himself, but he shall not shave the scale; and the priest shall isolate the person with the scale seven more days.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	34	"Then on the seventh day the priest shall look at the scale, and if the scale has not spread in the skin and it appears to be no deeper than the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean; and he shall wash his clothes and be clean.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	35	"But if the scale spreads farther in the skin after his cleansing,
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	36	then the priest shall look at him, and if the scale has spread in the skin, the priest need not seek for the yellowish hair; he is unclean.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	37	"If in his sight the scale has remained, however, and black hair has grown in it, the scale has healed, he is clean; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	38	"When a man or a woman has bright spots on the skin of the body, even white bright spots,
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	39	then the priest shall look, and if the bright spots on the skin of their bodies are a faint white, it is eczema that has broken out on the skin; he is clean.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	40	"Now if a man loses the hair of his head, he is bald; he is clean.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	41	"If his head becomes bald at the front and sides, he is bald on the forehead; he is clean.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	42	"But if on the bald head or the bald forehead, there occurs a reddish-white infection, it is leprosy breaking out on his bald head or on his bald forehead.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	43	"Then the priest shall look at him; and if the swelling of the infection is reddish-white on his bald head or on his bald forehead, like the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the body,
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	44	he is a leprous man, he is unclean. The priest shall surely pronounce him unclean; his infection is on his head.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	45	"As for the leper who has the infection, his clothes shall be torn, and the hair of his head shall be uncovered, and he shall cover his mustache and cry, 'Unclean! Unclean!'
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	46	"He shall remain unclean all the days during which he has the infection; he is unclean. He shall live alone; his dwelling shall be outside the camp.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	47	"When a garment has a mark of leprosy in it, whether it is a wool garment or a linen garment,
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	48	whether in warp or woof, of linen or of wool, whether in leather or in any article made of leather,
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	49	if the mark is greenish or reddish in the garment or in the leather, or in the warp or in the woof, or in any article of leather, it is a leprous mark and shall be shown to the priest.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	50	"Then the priest shall look at the mark and shall quarantine the article with the mark for seven days.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	51	"He shall then look at the mark on the seventh day; if the mark has spread in the garment, whether in the warp or in the woof, or in the leather, whatever the purpose for which the leather is used, the mark is a leprous malignancy, it is unclean.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	52	"So he shall burn the garment, whether the warp or the woof, in wool or in linen, or any article of leather in which the mark occurs, for it is a leprous malignancy; it shall be burned in the fire.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	53	"But if the priest shall look, and indeed the mark has not spread in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof, or in any article of leather,
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	54	then the priest shall order them to wash the thing in which the mark occurs and he shall quarantine it for seven more days.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	55	"After the article with the mark has been washed, the priest shall again look, and if the mark has not changed its appearance, even though the mark has not spread, it is unclean; you shall burn it in the fire, whether an eating away has produced bareness on the top or on the front of it.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	56	"Then if the priest looks, and if the mark has faded after it has been washed, then he shall tear it out of the garment or out of the leather, whether from the warp or from the woof;
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	57	and if it appears again in the garment, whether in the warp or in the woof, or in any article of leather, it is an outbreak; the article with the mark shall be burned in the fire.
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	58	"The garment, whether the warp or the woof, or any article of leather from which the mark has departed when you washed it, it shall then be washed a second time and will be clean."
Leviticus	Lev	3	13	59	This is the law for the mark of leprosy in a garment of wool or linen, whether in the warp or in the woof, or in any article of leather, for pronouncing it clean or unclean.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	1	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	2	"This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing. Now he shall be brought to the priest,
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	3	and the priest shall go out to the outside of the camp. Thus the priest shall look, and if the infection of leprosy has been healed in the leper,
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	4	then the priest shall give orders to take two live clean birds and cedar wood and a scarlet string and hyssop for the one who is to be cleansed.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	5	"The priest shall also give orders to slay the one bird in an earthenware vessel over running water.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	6	"As for the live bird, he shall take it together with the cedar wood and the scarlet string and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the live bird in the blood of the bird that was slain over the running water.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	7	"He shall then sprinkle seven times the one who is to be cleansed from the leprosy and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the live bird go free over the open field.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	8	"The one to be cleansed shall then wash his clothes and shave off all his hair and bathe in water and be clean. Now afterward, he may enter the camp, but he shall stay outside his tent for seven days.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	9	"It will be on the seventh day that he shall shave off all his hair: he shall shave his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair. He shall then wash his clothes and bathe his body in water and be clean.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	10	"Now on the eighth day he is to take two male lambs without defect, and a yearling ewe lamb without defect, and three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, and one log of oil;
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	11	and the priest who pronounces him clean shall present the man to be cleansed and the aforesaid before the LORD at the doorway of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	12	"Then the priest shall take the one male lamb and bring it for a guilt offering, with the log of oil, and present them as a wave offering before the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	13	"Next he shall slaughter the male lamb in the place where they slaughter the sin offering and the burnt offering, at the place of the sanctuary--for the guilt offering, like the sin offering, belongs to the priest; it is most holy.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	14	"The priest shall then take some of the blood of the guilt offering, and the priest shall put it on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	15	"The priest shall also take some of the log of oil, and pour it into his left palm;
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	16	the priest shall then dip his right-hand finger into the oil that is in his left palm, and with his finger sprinkle some of the oil seven times before the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	17	"Of the remaining oil which is in his palm, the priest shall put some on the right ear lobe of the one to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot, on the blood of the guilt offering;
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	18	while the rest of the oil that is in the priest's palm, he shall put on the head of the one to be cleansed. So the priest shall make atonement on his behalf before the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	19	"The priest shall next offer the sin offering and make atonement for the one to be cleansed from his uncleanness. Then afterward, he shall slaughter the burnt offering.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	20	"The priest shall offer up the burnt offering and the grain offering on the altar. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him, and he will be clean.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	21	"But if he is poor and his means are insufficient, then he is to take one male lamb for a guilt offering as a wave offering to make atonement for him, and one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, and a log of oil,
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	22	and two turtledoves or two young pigeons which are within his means, the one shall be a sin offering and the other a burnt offering.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	23	"Then the eighth day he shall bring them for his cleansing to the priest, at the doorway of the tent of meeting, before the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	24	"The priest shall take the lamb of the guilt offering and the log of oil, and the priest shall offer them for a wave offering before the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	25	"Next he shall slaughter the lamb of the guilt offering; and the priest is to take some of the blood of the guilt offering and put it on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	26	"The priest shall also pour some of the oil into his left palm;
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	27	and with his right-hand finger the priest shall sprinkle some of the oil that is in his left palm seven times before the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	28	"The priest shall then put some of the oil that is in his palm on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot, on the place of the blood of the guilt offering.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	29	"Moreover, the rest of the oil that is in the priest's palm he shall put on the head of the one to be cleansed, to make atonement on his behalf before the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	30	"He shall then offer one of the turtledoves or young pigeons, which are within his means.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	31	"He shall offer what he can afford, the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering, together with the grain offering. So the priest shall make atonement before the LORD on behalf of the one to be cleansed.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	32	"This is the law for him in whom there is an infection of leprosy, whose means are limited for his cleansing."
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	33	The LORD further spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying:
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	34	"When you enter the land of Canaan, which I give you for a possession, and I put a mark of leprosy on a house in the land of your possession,
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	35	then the one who owns the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, 'Something like a mark of leprosy has become visible to me in the house.'
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	36	"The priest shall then command that they empty the house before the priest goes in to look at the mark, so that everything in the house need not become unclean; and afterward the priest shall go in to look at the house.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	37	"So he shall look at the mark, and if the mark on the walls of the house has greenish or reddish depressions and appears deeper than the surface,
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	38	then the priest shall come out of the house, to the doorway, and quarantine the house for seven days.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	39	"The priest shall return on the seventh day and make an inspection. If the mark has indeed spread in the walls of the house,
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	40	then the priest shall order them to tear out the stones with the mark in them and throw them away at an unclean place outside the city.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	41	"He shall have the house scraped all around inside, and they shall dump the plaster that they scrape off at an unclean place outside the city.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	42	"Then they shall take other stones and replace those stones, and he shall take other plaster and replaster the house.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	43	"If, however, the mark breaks out again in the house after he has torn out the stones and scraped the house, and after it has been replastered,
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	44	then the priest shall come in and make an inspection. If he sees that the mark has indeed spread in the house, it is a malignant mark in the house; it is unclean.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	45	"He shall therefore tear down the house, its stones, and its timbers, and all the plaster of the house, and he shall take them outside the city to an unclean place.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	46	"Moreover, whoever goes into the house during the time that he has quarantined it, becomes unclean until evening.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	47	"Likewise, whoever lies down in the house shall wash his clothes, and whoever eats in the house shall wash his clothes.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	48	"If, on the other hand, the priest comes in and makes an inspection and the mark has not indeed spread in the house after the house has been replastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean because the mark has not reappeared.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	49	"To cleanse the house then, he shall take two birds and cedar wood and a scarlet string and hyssop,
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	50	and he shall slaughter the one bird in an earthenware vessel over running water.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	51	"Then he shall take the cedar wood and the hyssop and the scarlet string, with the live bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird as well as in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	52	"He shall thus cleanse the house with the blood of the bird and with the running water, along with the live bird and with the cedar wood and with the hyssop and with the scarlet string.
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	53	"However, he shall let the live bird go free outside the city into the open field. So he shall make atonement for the house, and it will be clean."
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	54	This is the law for any mark of leprosy--even for a scale,
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	55	and for the leprous garment or house,
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	56	and for a swelling, and for a scab, and for a bright spot--
Leviticus	Lev	3	14	57	to teach when they are unclean and when they are clean. This is the law of leprosy.
Leviticus	Lev	3	15	1	The LORD also spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
Leviticus	Lev	3	15	2	"Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, 'When any man has a discharge from his body, his discharge is unclean.
Leviticus	Lev	3	15	3	'This, moreover, shall be his uncleanness in his discharge: it is his uncleanness whether his body allows its discharge to flow or whether his body obstructs its discharge.
Leviticus	Lev	3	15	4	'Every bed on which the person with the discharge lies becomes unclean, and everything on which he sits becomes unclean.
Leviticus	Lev	3	15	5	'Anyone, moreover, who touches his bed shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening;
Leviticus	Lev	3	15	6	and whoever sits on the thing on which the man with the discharge has been sitting, shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening.
Leviticus	Lev	3	15	7	'Also whoever touches the person with the discharge shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening.
Leviticus	Lev	3	15	8	'Or if the man with the discharge spits on one who is clean, he too shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening.
Leviticus	Lev	3	15	9	'Every saddle on which the person with the discharge rides becomes unclean.
Leviticus	Lev	3	15	10	'Whoever then touches any of the things which were under him shall be unclean until evening, and he who carries them shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening.
Leviticus	Lev	3	15	11	'Likewise, whomever the one with the discharge touches without having rinsed his hands in water shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening.
Leviticus	Lev	3	15	12	'However, an earthenware vessel which the person with the discharge touches shall be broken, and every wooden vessel shall be rinsed in water.
Leviticus	Lev	3	15	13	'Now when the man with the discharge becomes cleansed from his discharge, then he shall count off for himself seven days for his cleansing; he shall then wash his clothes and bathe his body in running water and will become clean.
Leviticus	Lev	3	15	14	'Then on the eighth day he shall take for himself two turtledoves or two young pigeons, and come before the LORD to the doorway of the tent of meeting and give them to the priest;
Leviticus	Lev	3	15	15	and the priest shall offer them, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering. So the priest shall make atonement on his behalf before the LORD because of his discharge.
Leviticus	Lev	3	15	16	'Now if a man has a seminal emission, he shall bathe all his body in water and be unclean until evening.
Leviticus	Lev	3	15	17	'As for any garment or any leather on which there is seminal emission, it shall be washed with water and be unclean until evening.
Leviticus	Lev	3	15	18	'If a man lies with a woman so that there is a seminal emission, they shall both bathe in water and be unclean until evening.
Leviticus	Lev	3	15	19	'When a woman has a discharge, if her discharge in her body is blood, she shall continue in her menstrual impurity for seven days; and whoever touches her shall be unclean until evening.
Leviticus	Lev	3	15	20	'Everything also on which she lies during her menstrual impurity shall be unclean, and everything on which she sits shall be unclean.
Leviticus	Lev	3	15	21	'Anyone who touches her bed shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening.
Leviticus	Lev	3	15	22	'Whoever touches any thing on which she sits shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening.
Leviticus	Lev	3	15	23	'Whether it be on the bed or on the thing on which she is sitting, when he touches it, he shall be unclean until evening.
Leviticus	Lev	3	15	24	'If a man actually lies with her so that her menstrual impurity is on him, he shall be unclean seven days, and every bed on which he lies shall be unclean.
Leviticus	Lev	3	15	25	'Now if a woman has a discharge of her blood many days, not at the period of her menstrual impurity, or if she has a discharge beyond that period, all the days of her impure discharge she shall continue as though in her menstrual impurity; she is unclean.
Leviticus	Lev	3	15	26	'Any bed on which she lies all the days of her discharge shall be to her like her bed at menstruation; and every thing on which she sits shall be unclean, like her uncleanness at that time.
Leviticus	Lev	3	15	27	'Likewise, whoever touches them shall be unclean and shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening.
Leviticus	Lev	3	15	28	'When she becomes clean from her discharge, she shall count off for herself seven days; and afterward she will be clean.
Leviticus	Lev	3	15	29	'Then on the eighth day she shall take for herself two turtledoves or two young pigeons and bring them in to the priest, to the doorway of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus	Lev	3	15	30	'The priest shall offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering. So the priest shall make atonement on her behalf before the LORD because of her impure discharge.'
Leviticus	Lev	3	15	31	"Thus you shall keep the sons of Israel separated from their uncleanness, so that they will not die in their uncleanness by their defiling My tabernacle that is among them."
Leviticus	Lev	3	15	32	This is the law for the one with a discharge, and for the man who has a seminal emission so that he is unclean by it,
Leviticus	Lev	3	15	33	and for the woman who is ill because of menstrual impurity, and for the one who has a discharge, whether a male or a female, or a man who lies with an unclean woman.
Leviticus	Lev	3	16	1	Now the LORD spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they had approached the presence of the LORD and died.
Leviticus	Lev	3	16	2	The LORD said to Moses: "Tell your brother Aaron that he shall not enter at any time into the holy place inside the veil, before the mercy seat which is on the ark, or he will die; for I will appear in the cloud over the mercy seat.
Leviticus	Lev	3	16	3	"Aaron shall enter the holy place with this: with a bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.
Leviticus	Lev	3	16	4	"He shall put on the holy linen tunic, and the linen undergarments shall be next to his body, and he shall be girded with the linen sash and attired with the linen turban (these are holy garments). Then he shall bathe his body in water and put them on.
Leviticus	Lev	3	16	5	"He shall take from the congregation of the sons of Israel two male goats for a sin offering and one ram for a burnt offering.
Leviticus	Lev	3	16	6	"Then Aaron shall offer the bull for the sin offering which is for himself, that he may make atonement for himself and for his household.
Leviticus	Lev	3	16	7	"He shall take the two goats and present them before the LORD at the doorway of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus	Lev	3	16	8	"Aaron shall cast lots for the two goats, one lot for the LORD and the other lot for the scapegoat.
Leviticus	Lev	3	16	9	"Then Aaron shall offer the goat on which the lot for the LORD fell, and make it a sin offering.
Leviticus	Lev	3	16	10	"But the goat on which the lot for the scapegoat fell shall be presented alive before the LORD, to make atonement upon it, to send it into the wilderness as the scapegoat.
Leviticus	Lev	3	16	11	"Then Aaron shall offer the bull of the sin offering which is for himself and make atonement for himself and for his household, and he shall slaughter the bull of the sin offering which is for himself.
Leviticus	Lev	3	16	12	"He shall take a firepan full of coals of fire from upon the altar before the LORD and two handfuls of finely ground sweet incense, and bring it inside the veil.
Leviticus	Lev	3	16	13	"He shall put the incense on the fire before the LORD, that the cloud of incense may cover the mercy seat that is on the ark of the testimony, otherwise he will die.
Leviticus	Lev	3	16	14	"Moreover, he shall take some of the blood of the bull and sprinkle it with his finger on the mercy seat on the east side; also in front of the mercy seat he shall sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times.
Leviticus	Lev	3	16	15	"Then he shall slaughter the goat of the sin offering which is for the people, and bring its blood inside the veil and do with its blood as he did with the blood of the bull, and sprinkle it on the mercy seat and in front of the mercy seat.
Leviticus	Lev	3	16	16	"He shall make atonement for the holy place, because of the impurities of the sons of Israel and because of their transgressions in regard to all their sins; and thus he shall do for the tent of meeting which abides with them in the midst of their impurities.
Leviticus	Lev	3	16	17	"When he goes in to make atonement in the holy place, no one shall be in the tent of meeting until he comes out, that he may make atonement for himself and for his household and for all the assembly of Israel.
Leviticus	Lev	3	16	18	"Then he shall go out to the altar that is before the LORD and make atonement for it, and shall take some of the blood of the bull and of the blood of the goat and put it on the horns of the altar on all sides.
Leviticus	Lev	3	16	19	"With his finger he shall sprinkle some of the blood on it seven times and cleanse it, and from the impurities of the sons of Israel consecrate it.
Leviticus	Lev	3	16	20	"When he finishes atoning for the holy place and the tent of meeting and the altar, he shall offer the live goat.
Leviticus	Lev	3	16	21	"Then Aaron shall lay both of his hands on the head of the live goat, and confess over it all the iniquities of the sons of Israel and all their transgressions in regard to all their sins; and he shall lay them on the head of the goat and send it away into the wilderness by the hand of a man who stands in readiness.
Leviticus	Lev	3	16	22	"The goat shall bear on itself all their iniquities to a solitary land; and he shall release the goat in the wilderness.
Leviticus	Lev	3	16	23	"Then Aaron shall come into the tent of meeting and take off the linen garments which he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there.
Leviticus	Lev	3	16	24	"He shall bathe his body with water in a holy place and put on his clothes, and come forth and offer his burnt offering and the burnt offering of the people and make atonement for himself and for the people.
Leviticus	Lev	3	16	25	"Then he shall offer up in smoke the fat of the sin offering on the altar.
Leviticus	Lev	3	16	26	"The one who released the goat as the scapegoat shall wash his clothes and bathe his body with water; then afterward he shall come into the camp.
Leviticus	Lev	3	16	27	"But the bull of the sin offering and the goat of the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall be taken outside the camp, and they shall burn their hides, their flesh, and their refuse in the fire.
Leviticus	Lev	3	16	28	"Then the one who burns them shall wash his clothes and bathe his body with water, then afterward he shall come into the camp.
Leviticus	Lev	3	16	29	"This shall be a permanent statute for you: in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you shall humble your souls and not do any work, whether the native, or the alien who sojourns among you;
Leviticus	Lev	3	16	30	for it is on this day that atonement shall be made for you to cleanse you; you will be clean from all your sins before the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	16	31	"It is to be a sabbath of solemn rest for you, that you may humble your souls; it is a permanent statute.
Leviticus	Lev	3	16	32	"So the priest who is anointed and ordained to serve as priest in his father's place shall make atonement: he shall thus put on the linen garments, the holy garments,
Leviticus	Lev	3	16	33	and make atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall make atonement for the tent of meeting and for the altar. He shall also make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly.
Leviticus	Lev	3	16	34	"Now you shall have this as a permanent statute, to make atonement for the sons of Israel for all their sins once every year." And just as the LORD had commanded Moses, so he did.
Leviticus	Lev	3	17	1	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus	Lev	3	17	2	"Speak to Aaron and to his sons and to all the sons of Israel and say to them, 'This is what the LORD has commanded, saying,
Leviticus	Lev	3	17	3	"Any man from the house of Israel who slaughters an ox or a lamb or a goat in the camp, or who slaughters it outside the camp,
Leviticus	Lev	3	17	4	and has not brought it to the doorway of the tent of meeting to present it as an offering to the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD, bloodguiltiness is to be reckoned to that man. He has shed blood and that man shall be cut off from among his people.
Leviticus	Lev	3	17	5	"The reason is so that the sons of Israel may bring their sacrifices which they were sacrificing in the open field, that they may bring them in to the LORD, at the doorway of the tent of meeting to the priest, and sacrifice them as sacrifices of peace offerings to the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	17	6	"The priest shall sprinkle the blood on the altar of the LORD at the doorway of the tent of meeting, and offer up the fat in smoke as a soothing aroma to the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	17	7	"They shall no longer sacrifice their sacrifices to the goat demons with which they play the harlot. This shall be a permanent statute to them throughout their generations."'
Leviticus	Lev	3	17	8	"Then you shall say to them, 'Any man from the house of Israel, or from the aliens who sojourn among them, who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice,
Leviticus	Lev	3	17	9	and does not bring it to the doorway of the tent of meeting to offer it to the LORD, that man also shall be cut off from his people.
Leviticus	Lev	3	17	10	'And any man from the house of Israel, or from the aliens who sojourn among them, who eats any blood, I will set My face against that person who eats blood and will cut him off from among his people.
Leviticus	Lev	3	17	11	'For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you on the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood by reason of the life that makes atonement.'
Leviticus	Lev	3	17	12	"Therefore I said to the sons of Israel, 'No person among you may eat blood, nor may any alien who sojourns among you eat blood.'
Leviticus	Lev	3	17	13	"So when any man from the sons of Israel, or from the aliens who sojourn among them, in hunting catches a beast or a bird which may be eaten, he shall pour out its blood and cover it with earth.
Leviticus	Lev	3	17	14	"For as for the life of all flesh, its blood is identified with its life. Therefore I said to the sons of Israel, 'You are not to eat the blood of any flesh, for the life of all flesh is its blood; whoever eats it shall be cut off.'
Leviticus	Lev	3	17	15	"When any person eats an animal which dies or is torn by beasts, whether he is a native or an alien, he shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and remain unclean until evening; then he will become clean.
Leviticus	Lev	3	17	16	"But if he does not wash them or bathe his body, then he shall bear his guilt."
Leviticus	Lev	3	18	1	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus	Lev	3	18	2	"Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'I am the LORD your God.
Leviticus	Lev	3	18	3	'You shall not do what is done in the land of Egypt where you lived, nor are you to do what is done in the land of Canaan where I am bringing you; you shall not walk in their statutes.
Leviticus	Lev	3	18	4	'You are to perform My judgments and keep My statutes, to live in accord with them; I am the LORD your God.
Leviticus	Lev	3	18	5	'So you shall keep My statutes and My judgments, by which a man may live if he does them; I am the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	18	6	'None of you shall approach any blood relative of his to uncover nakedness; I am the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	18	7	'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father, that is, the nakedness of your mother. She is your mother; you are not to uncover her nakedness.
Leviticus	Lev	3	18	8	'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's wife; it is your father's nakedness.
Leviticus	Lev	3	18	9	'The nakedness of your sister, either your father's daughter or your mother's daughter, whether born at home or born outside, their nakedness you shall not uncover.
Leviticus	Lev	3	18	10	'The nakedness of your son's daughter or your daughter's daughter, their nakedness you shall not uncover; for their nakedness is yours.
Leviticus	Lev	3	18	11	'The nakedness of your father's wife's daughter, born to your father, she is your sister, you shall not uncover her nakedness.
Leviticus	Lev	3	18	12	'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's sister; she is your father's blood relative.
Leviticus	Lev	3	18	13	'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother's sister, for she is your mother's blood relative.
Leviticus	Lev	3	18	14	'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's brother; you shall not approach his wife, she is your aunt.
Leviticus	Lev	3	18	15	'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law; she is your son's wife, you shall not uncover her nakedness.
Leviticus	Lev	3	18	16	'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother's wife; it is your brother's nakedness.
Leviticus	Lev	3	18	17	'You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and of her daughter, nor shall you take her son's daughter or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; they are blood relatives. It is lewdness.
Leviticus	Lev	3	18	18	'You shall not marry a woman in addition to her sister as a rival while she is alive, to uncover her nakedness.
Leviticus	Lev	3	18	19	'Also you shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness during her menstrual impurity.
Leviticus	Lev	3	18	20	'You shall not have intercourse with your neighbor's wife, to be defiled with her.
Leviticus	Lev	3	18	21	'You shall not give any of your offspring to offer them to Molech, nor shall you profane the name of your God; I am the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	18	22	'You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination.
Leviticus	Lev	3	18	23	'Also you shall not have intercourse with any animal to be defiled with it, nor shall any woman stand before an animal to mate with it; it is a perversion.
Leviticus	Lev	3	18	24	'Do not defile yourselves by any of these things; for by all these the nations which I am casting out before you have become defiled.
Leviticus	Lev	3	18	25	'For the land has become defiled, therefore I have brought its punishment upon it, so the land has spewed out its inhabitants.
Leviticus	Lev	3	18	26	'But as for you, you are to keep My statutes and My judgments and shall not do any of these abominations, neither the native, nor the alien who sojourns among you
Leviticus	Lev	3	18	27	(for the men of the land who have been before you have done all these abominations, and the land has become defiled);
Leviticus	Lev	3	18	28	so that the land will not spew you out, should you defile it, as it has spewed out the nation which has been before you.
Leviticus	Lev	3	18	29	'For whoever does any of these abominations, those persons who do so shall be cut off from among their people.
Leviticus	Lev	3	18	30	'Thus you are to keep My charge, that you do not practice any of the abominable customs which have been practiced before you, so as not to defile yourselves with them; I am the LORD your God.'"
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	1	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	2	"Speak to all the congregation of the sons of Israel and say to them, 'You shall be holy, for I the LORD your God am holy.
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	3	'Every one of you shall reverence his mother and his father, and you shall keep My sabbaths; I am the LORD your God.
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	4	'Do not turn to idols or make for yourselves molten gods; I am the LORD your God.
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	5	'Now when you offer a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD, you shall offer it so that you may be accepted.
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	6	'It shall be eaten the same day you offer it, and the next day; but what remains until the third day shall be burned with fire.
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	7	'So if it is eaten at all on the third day, it is an offense; it will not be accepted.
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	8	'Everyone who eats it will bear his iniquity, for he has profaned the holy thing of the LORD; and that person shall be cut off from his people.
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	9	'Now when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not reap to the very corners of your field, nor shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest.
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	10	'Nor shall you glean your vineyard, nor shall you gather the fallen fruit of your vineyard; you shall leave them for the needy and for the stranger. I am the LORD your God.
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	11	'You shall not steal, nor deal falsely, nor lie to one another.
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	12	'You shall not swear falsely by My name, so as to profane the name of your God; I am the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	13	'You shall not oppress your neighbor, nor rob him. The wages of a hired man are not to remain with you all night until morning.
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	14	'You shall not curse a deaf man, nor place a stumbling block before the blind, but you shall revere your God; I am the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	15	'You shall do no injustice in judgment; you shall not be partial to the poor nor defer to the great, but you are to judge your neighbor fairly.
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	16	'You shall not go about as a slanderer among your people, and you are not to act against the life of your neighbor; I am the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	17	'You shall not hate your fellow countryman in your heart; you may surely reprove your neighbor, but shall not incur sin because of him.
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	18	'You shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the sons of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself; I am the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	19	'You are to keep My statutes. You shall not breed together two kinds of your cattle; you shall not sow your field with two kinds of seed, nor wear a garment upon you of two kinds of material mixed together.
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	20	'Now if a man lies carnally with a woman who is a slave acquired for another man, but who has in no way been redeemed nor given her freedom, there shall be punishment; they shall not, however, be put to death, because she was not free.
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	21	'He shall bring his guilt offering to the LORD to the doorway of the tent of meeting, a ram for a guilt offering.
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	22	'The priest shall also make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering before the LORD for his sin which he has committed, and the sin which he has committed will be forgiven him.
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	23	'When you enter the land and plant all kinds of trees for food, then you shall count their fruit as forbidden. Three years it shall be forbidden to you; it shall not be eaten.
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	24	'But in the fourth year all its fruit shall be holy, an offering of praise to the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	25	'In the fifth year you are to eat of its fruit, that its yield may increase for you; I am the LORD your God.
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	26	'You shall not eat anything with the blood, nor practice divination or soothsaying.
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	27	'You shall not round off the side-growth of your heads nor harm the edges of your beard.
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	28	'You shall not make any cuts in your body for the dead nor make any tattoo marks on yourselves: I am the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	29	'Do not profane your daughter by making her a harlot, so that the land will not fall to harlotry and the land become full of lewdness.
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	30	'You shall keep My sabbaths and revere My sanctuary; I am the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	31	'Do not turn to mediums or spiritists; do not seek them out to be defiled by them. I am the LORD your God.
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	32	'You shall rise up before the grayheaded and honor the aged, and you shall revere your God; I am the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	33	'When a stranger resides with you in your land, you shall not do him wrong.
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	34	'The stranger who resides with you shall be to you as the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt; I am the LORD your God.
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	35	'You shall do no wrong in judgment, in measurement of weight, or capacity.
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	36	'You shall have just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin; I am the LORD your God, who brought you out from the land of Egypt.
Leviticus	Lev	3	19	37	'You shall thus observe all My statutes and all My ordinances and do them; I am the LORD.'"
Leviticus	Lev	3	20	1	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus	Lev	3	20	2	"You shall also say to the sons of Israel: 'Any man from the sons of Israel or from the aliens sojourning in Israel who gives any of his offspring to Molech, shall surely be put to death; the people of the land shall stone him with stones.
Leviticus	Lev	3	20	3	'I will also set My face against that man and will cut him off from among his people, because he has given some of his offspring to Molech, so as to defile My sanctuary and to profane My holy name.
Leviticus	Lev	3	20	4	'If the people of the land, however, should ever disregard that man when he gives any of his offspring to Molech, so as not to put him to death,
Leviticus	Lev	3	20	5	then I Myself will set My face against that man and against his family, and I will cut off from among their people both him and all those who play the harlot after him, by playing the harlot after Molech.
Leviticus	Lev	3	20	6	'As for the person who turns to mediums and to spiritists, to play the harlot after them, I will also set My face against that person and will cut him off from among his people.
Leviticus	Lev	3	20	7	'You shall consecrate yourselves therefore and be holy, for I am the LORD your God.
Leviticus	Lev	3	20	8	'You shall keep My statutes and practice them; I am the LORD who sanctifies you.
Leviticus	Lev	3	20	9	'If there is anyone who curses his father or his mother, he shall surely be put to death; he has cursed his father or his mother, his bloodguiltiness is upon him.
Leviticus	Lev	3	20	10	'If there is a man who commits adultery with another man's wife, one who commits adultery with his friend's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.
Leviticus	Lev	3	20	11	'If there is a man who lies with his father's wife, he has uncovered his father's nakedness; both of them shall surely be put to death, their bloodguiltiness is upon them.
Leviticus	Lev	3	20	12	'If there is a man who lies with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall surely be put to death; they have committed incest, their bloodguiltiness is upon them.
Leviticus	Lev	3	20	13	'If there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed a detestable act; they shall surely be put to death. Their bloodguiltiness is upon them.
Leviticus	Lev	3	20	14	'If there is a man who marries a woman and her mother, it is immorality; both he and they shall be burned with fire, so that there will be no immorality in your midst.
Leviticus	Lev	3	20	15	'If there is a man who lies with an animal, he shall surely be put to death; you shall also kill the animal.
Leviticus	Lev	3	20	16	'If there is a woman who approaches any animal to mate with it, you shall kill the woman and the animal; they shall surely be put to death. Their bloodguiltiness is upon them.
Leviticus	Lev	3	20	17	'If there is a man who takes his sister, his father's daughter or his mother's daughter, so that he sees her nakedness and she sees his nakedness, it is a disgrace; and they shall be cut off in the sight of the sons of their people. He has uncovered his sister's nakedness; he bears his guilt.
Leviticus	Lev	3	20	18	'If there is a man who lies with a menstruous woman and uncovers her nakedness, he has laid bare her flow, and she has exposed the flow of her blood; thus both of them shall be cut off from among their people.
Leviticus	Lev	3	20	19	'You shall also not uncover the nakedness of your mother's sister or of your father's sister, for such a one has made naked his blood relative; they will bear their guilt.
Leviticus	Lev	3	20	20	'If there is a man who lies with his uncle's wife he has uncovered his uncle's nakedness; they will bear their sin. They will die childless.
Leviticus	Lev	3	20	21	'If there is a man who takes his brother's wife, it is abhorrent; he has uncovered his brother's nakedness. They will be childless.
Leviticus	Lev	3	20	22	'You are therefore to keep all My statutes and all My ordinances and do them, so that the land to which I am bringing you to live will not spew you out.
Leviticus	Lev	3	20	23	'Moreover, you shall not follow the customs of the nation which I will drive out before you, for they did all these things, and therefore I have abhorred them.
Leviticus	Lev	3	20	24	'Hence I have said to you, "You are to possess their land, and I Myself will give it to you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey." I am the LORD your God, who has separated you from the peoples.
Leviticus	Lev	3	20	25	'You are therefore to make a distinction between the clean animal and the unclean, and between the unclean bird and the clean; and you shall not make yourselves detestable by animal or by bird or by anything that creeps on the ground, which I have separated for you as unclean.
Leviticus	Lev	3	20	26	'Thus you are to be holy to Me, for I the LORD am holy; and I have set you apart from the peoples to be Mine.
Leviticus	Lev	3	20	27	'Now a man or a woman who is a medium or a spiritist shall surely be put to death. They shall be stoned with stones, their bloodguiltiness is upon them.'"
Leviticus	Lev	3	21	1	Then the LORD said to Moses, "Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say to them: 'No one shall defile himself for a dead person among his people,
Leviticus	Lev	3	21	2	except for his relatives who are nearest to him, his mother and his father and his son and his daughter and his brother,
Leviticus	Lev	3	21	3	also for his virgin sister, who is near to him because she has had no husband; for her he may defile himself.
Leviticus	Lev	3	21	4	'He shall not defile himself as a relative by marriage among his people, and so profane himself.
Leviticus	Lev	3	21	5	'They shall not make any baldness on their heads, nor shave off the edges of their beards, nor make any cuts in their flesh.
Leviticus	Lev	3	21	6	'They shall be holy to their God and not profane the name of their God, for they present the offerings by fire to the LORD, the food of their God; so they shall be holy.
Leviticus	Lev	3	21	7	'They shall not take a woman who is profaned by harlotry, nor shall they take a woman divorced from her husband; for he is holy to his God.
Leviticus	Lev	3	21	8	'You shall consecrate him, therefore, for he offers the food of your God; he shall be holy to you; for I the LORD, who sanctifies you, am holy.
Leviticus	Lev	3	21	9	'Also the daughter of any priest, if she profanes herself by harlotry, she profanes her father; she shall be burned with fire.
Leviticus	Lev	3	21	10	'The priest who is the highest among his brothers, on whose head the anointing oil has been poured and who has been consecrated to wear the garments, shall not uncover his head nor tear his clothes;
Leviticus	Lev	3	21	11	nor shall he approach any dead person, nor defile himself even for his father or his mother;
Leviticus	Lev	3	21	12	nor shall he go out of the sanctuary nor profane the sanctuary of his God, for the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is on him; I am the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	21	13	'He shall take a wife in her virginity.
Leviticus	Lev	3	21	14	'A widow, or a divorced woman, or one who is profaned by harlotry, these he may not take; but rather he is to marry a virgin of his own people,
Leviticus	Lev	3	21	15	so that he will not profane his offspring among his people; for I am the LORD who sanctifies him.'"
Leviticus	Lev	3	21	16	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus	Lev	3	21	17	"Speak to Aaron, saying, 'No man of your offspring throughout their generations who has a defect shall approach to offer the food of his God.
Leviticus	Lev	3	21	18	'For no one who has a defect shall approach: a blind man, or a lame man, or he who has a disfigured face, or any deformed limb,
Leviticus	Lev	3	21	19	or a man who has a broken foot or broken hand,
Leviticus	Lev	3	21	20	or a hunchback or a dwarf, or one who has a defect in his eye or eczema or scabs or crushed testicles.
Leviticus	Lev	3	21	21	'No man among the descendants of Aaron the priest who has a defect is to come near to offer the LORD'S offerings by fire; since he has a defect, he shall not come near to offer the food of his God.
Leviticus	Lev	3	21	22	'He may eat the food of his God, both of the most holy and of the holy,
Leviticus	Lev	3	21	23	only he shall not go in to the veil or come near the altar because he has a defect, so that he will not profane My sanctuaries. For I am the LORD who sanctifies them.'"
Leviticus	Lev	3	21	24	So Moses spoke to Aaron and to his sons and to all the sons of Israel.
Leviticus	Lev	3	22	1	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus	Lev	3	22	2	"Tell Aaron and his sons to be careful with the holy gifts of the sons of Israel, which they dedicate to Me, so as not to profane My holy name; I am the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	22	3	"Say to them, 'If any man among all your descendants throughout your generations approaches the holy gifts which the sons of Israel dedicate to the LORD, while he has an uncleanness, that person shall be cut off from before Me; I am the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	22	4	'No man of the descendants of Aaron, who is a leper or who has a discharge, may eat of the holy gifts until he is clean. And if one touches anything made unclean by a corpse or if a man has a seminal emission,
Leviticus	Lev	3	22	5	or if a man touches any teeming things by which he is made unclean, or any man by whom he is made unclean, whatever his uncleanness;
Leviticus	Lev	3	22	6	a person who touches any such shall be unclean until evening, and shall not eat of the holy gifts unless he has bathed his body in water.
Leviticus	Lev	3	22	7	'But when the sun sets, he will be clean, and afterward he shall eat of the holy gifts, for it is his food.
Leviticus	Lev	3	22	8	'He shall not eat an animal which dies or is torn by beasts, becoming unclean by it; I am the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	22	9	'They shall therefore keep My charge, so that they will not bear sin because of it and die thereby because they profane it; I am the LORD who sanctifies them.
Leviticus	Lev	3	22	10	'No layman, however, is to eat the holy gift; a sojourner with the priest or a hired man shall not eat of the holy gift.
Leviticus	Lev	3	22	11	'But if a priest buys a slave as his property with his money, that one may eat of it, and those who are born in his house may eat of his food.
Leviticus	Lev	3	22	12	'If a priest's daughter is married to a layman, she shall not eat of the offering of the gifts.
Leviticus	Lev	3	22	13	'But if a priest's daughter becomes a widow or divorced, and has no child and returns to her father's house as in her youth, she shall eat of her father's food; but no layman shall eat of it.
Leviticus	Lev	3	22	14	'But if a man eats a holy gift unintentionally, then he shall add to it a fifth of it and shall give the holy gift to the priest.
Leviticus	Lev	3	22	15	'They shall not profane the holy gifts of the sons of Israel which they offer to the LORD,
Leviticus	Lev	3	22	16	and so cause them to bear punishment for guilt by eating their holy gifts; for I am the LORD who sanctifies them.'"
Leviticus	Lev	3	22	17	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus	Lev	3	22	18	"Speak to Aaron and to his sons and to all the sons of Israel and say to them, 'Any man of the house of Israel or of the aliens in Israel who presents his offering, whether it is any of their votive or any of their freewill offerings, which they present to the LORD for a burnt offering--
Leviticus	Lev	3	22	19	for you to be accepted--it must be a male without defect from the cattle, the sheep, or the goats.
Leviticus	Lev	3	22	20	'Whatever has a defect, you shall not offer, for it will not be accepted for you.
Leviticus	Lev	3	22	21	'When a man offers a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD to fulfill a special vow or for a freewill offering, of the herd or of the flock, it must be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no defect in it.
Leviticus	Lev	3	22	22	'Those that are blind or fractured or maimed or having a running sore or eczema or scabs, you shall not offer to the LORD, nor make of them an offering by fire on the altar to the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	22	23	'In respect to an ox or a lamb which has an overgrown or stunted member, you may present it for a freewill offering, but for a vow it will not be accepted.
Leviticus	Lev	3	22	24	'Also anything with its testicles bruised or crushed or torn or cut, you shall not offer to the LORD, or sacrifice in your land,
Leviticus	Lev	3	22	25	nor shall you accept any such from the hand of a foreigner for offering as the food of your God; for their corruption is in them, they have a defect, they shall not be accepted for you.'"
Leviticus	Lev	3	22	26	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus	Lev	3	22	27	"When an ox or a sheep or a goat is born, it shall remain seven days with its mother, and from the eighth day on it shall be accepted as a sacrifice of an offering by fire to the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	22	28	"But, whether it is an ox or a sheep, you shall not kill both it and its young in one day.
Leviticus	Lev	3	22	29	"When you sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the LORD, you shall sacrifice it so that you may be accepted.
Leviticus	Lev	3	22	30	"It shall be eaten on the same day, you shall leave none of it until morning; I am the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	22	31	"So you shall keep My commandments, and do them; I am the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	22	32	"You shall not profane My holy name, but I will be sanctified among the sons of Israel; I am the LORD who sanctifies you,
Leviticus	Lev	3	22	33	who brought you out from the land of Egypt, to be your God; I am the LORD."
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	1	The LORD spoke again to Moses, saying,
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	2	"Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'The LORD'S appointed times which you shall proclaim as holy convocations--My appointed times are these:
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	3	'For six days work may be done, but on the seventh day there is a sabbath of complete rest, a holy convocation. You shall not do any work; it is a sabbath to the LORD in all your dwellings.
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	4	'These are the appointed times of the LORD, holy convocations which you shall proclaim at the times appointed for them.
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	5	'In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at twilight is the LORD'S Passover.
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	6	'Then on the fifteenth day of the same month there is the Feast of Unleavened Bread to the LORD; for seven days you shall eat unleavened bread.
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	7	'On the first day you shall have a holy convocation; you shall not do any laborious work.
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	8	'But for seven days you shall present an offering by fire to the LORD. On the seventh day is a holy convocation; you shall not do any laborious work.'"
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	9	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	10	"Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'When you enter the land which I am going to give to you and reap its harvest, then you shall bring in the sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest.
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	11	'He shall wave the sheaf before the LORD for you to be accepted; on the day after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	12	'Now on the day when you wave the sheaf, you shall offer a male lamb one year old without defect for a burnt offering to the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	13	'Its grain offering shall then be two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, an offering by fire to the LORD for a soothing aroma, with its drink offering, a fourth of a hin of wine.
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	14	'Until this same day, until you have brought in the offering of your God, you shall eat neither bread nor roasted grain nor new growth. It is to be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwelling places.
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	15	'You shall also count for yourselves from the day after the sabbath, from the day when you brought in the sheaf of the wave offering; there shall be seven complete sabbaths.
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	16	'You shall count fifty days to the day after the seventh sabbath; then you shall present a new grain offering to the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	17	'You shall bring in from your dwelling places two loaves of bread for a wave offering, made of two-tenths of an ephah; they shall be of a fine flour, baked with leaven as first fruits to the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	18	'Along with the bread you shall present seven one year old male lambs without defect, and a bull of the herd and two rams; they are to be a burnt offering to the LORD, with their grain offering and their drink offerings, an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	19	'You shall also offer one male goat for a sin offering and two male lambs one year old for a sacrifice of peace offerings.
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	20	'The priest shall then wave them with the bread of the first fruits for a wave offering with two lambs before the LORD; they are to be holy to the LORD for the priest.
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	21	'On this same day you shall make a proclamation as well; you are to have a holy convocation. You shall do no laborious work. It is to be a perpetual statute in all your dwelling places throughout your generations.
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	22	'When you reap the harvest of your land, moreover, you shall not reap to the very corners of your field nor gather the gleaning of your harvest; you are to leave them for the needy and the alien. I am the LORD your God.'"
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	23	Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	24	"Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'In the seventh month on the first of the month you shall have a rest, a reminder by blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation.
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	25	'You shall not do any laborious work, but you shall present an offering by fire to the LORD.'"
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	26	The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	27	"On exactly the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement; it shall be a holy convocation for you, and you shall humble your souls and present an offering by fire to the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	28	"You shall not do any work on this same day, for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement on your behalf before the LORD your God.
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	29	"If there is any person who will not humble himself on this same day, he shall be cut off from his people.
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	30	"As for any person who does any work on this same day, that person I will destroy from among his people.
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	31	"You shall do no work at all. It is to be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwelling places.
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	32	"It is to be a sabbath of complete rest to you, and you shall humble your souls; on the ninth of the month at evening, from evening until evening you shall keep your sabbath."
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	33	Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	34	"Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'On the fifteenth of this seventh month is the Feast of Booths for seven days to the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	35	'On the first day is a holy convocation; you shall do no laborious work of any kind.
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	36	'For seven days you shall present an offering by fire to the LORD. On the eighth day you shall have a holy convocation and present an offering by fire to the LORD; it is an assembly. You shall do no laborious work.
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	37	'These are the appointed times of the LORD which you shall proclaim as holy convocations, to present offerings by fire to the LORD--burnt offerings and grain offerings, sacrifices and drink offerings, each day's matter on its own day--
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	38	besides those of the sabbaths of the LORD, and besides your gifts and besides all your votive and freewill offerings, which you give to the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	39	'On exactly the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the crops of the land, you shall celebrate the feast of the LORD for seven days, with a rest on the first day and a rest on the eighth day.
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	40	'Now on the first day you shall take for yourselves the foliage of beautiful trees, palm branches and boughs of leafy trees and willows of the brook, and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God for seven days.
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	41	'You shall thus celebrate it as a feast to the LORD for seven days in the year. It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations; you shall celebrate it in the seventh month.
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	42	'You shall live in booths for seven days; all the native-born in Israel shall live in booths,
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	43	so that your generations may know that I had the sons of Israel live in booths when I brought them out from the land of Egypt. I am the LORD your God.'"
Leviticus	Lev	3	23	44	So Moses declared to the sons of Israel the appointed times of the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	24	1	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus	Lev	3	24	2	"Command the sons of Israel that they bring to you clear oil from beaten olives for the light, to make a lamp burn continually.
Leviticus	Lev	3	24	3	"Outside the veil of testimony in the tent of meeting, Aaron shall keep it in order from evening to morning before the LORD continually; it shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations.
Leviticus	Lev	3	24	4	"He shall keep the lamps in order on the pure gold lampstand before the LORD continually.
Leviticus	Lev	3	24	5	"Then you shall take fine flour and bake twelve cakes with it; two-tenths of an ephah shall be in each cake.
Leviticus	Lev	3	24	6	"You shall set them in two rows, six to a row, on the pure gold table before the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	24	7	"You shall put pure frankincense on each row that it may be a memorial portion for the bread, even an offering by fire to the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	24	8	"Every sabbath day he shall set it in order before the LORD continually; it is an everlasting covenant for the sons of Israel.
Leviticus	Lev	3	24	9	"It shall be for Aaron and his sons, and they shall eat it in a holy place; for it is most holy to him from the LORD'S offerings by fire, his portion forever."
Leviticus	Lev	3	24	10	Now the son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the sons of Israel; and the Israelite woman's son and a man of Israel struggled with each other in the camp.
Leviticus	Lev	3	24	11	The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name and cursed. So they brought him to Moses. (Now his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.)
Leviticus	Lev	3	24	12	They put him in custody so that the command of the LORD might be made clear to them.
Leviticus	Lev	3	24	13	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus	Lev	3	24	14	"Bring the one who has cursed outside the camp, and let all who heard him lay their hands on his head; then let all the congregation stone him.
Leviticus	Lev	3	24	15	"You shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'If anyone curses his God, then he will bear his sin.
Leviticus	Lev	3	24	16	'Moreover, the one who blasphemes the name of the LORD shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall certainly stone him. The alien as well as the native, when he blasphemes the Name, shall be put to death.
Leviticus	Lev	3	24	17	'If a man takes the life of any human being, he shall surely be put to death.
Leviticus	Lev	3	24	18	'The one who takes the life of an animal shall make it good, life for life.
Leviticus	Lev	3	24	19	'If a man injures his neighbor, just as he has done, so it shall be done to him:
Leviticus	Lev	3	24	20	fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; just as he has injured a man, so it shall be inflicted on him.
Leviticus	Lev	3	24	21	'Thus the one who kills an animal shall make it good, but the one who kills a man shall be put to death.
Leviticus	Lev	3	24	22	'There shall be one standard for you; it shall be for the stranger as well as the native, for I am the LORD your God.'"
Leviticus	Lev	3	24	23	Then Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, and they brought the one who had cursed outside the camp and stoned him with stones. Thus the sons of Israel did, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	1	The LORD then spoke to Moses at Mount Sinai, saying,
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	2	"Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'When you come into the land which I shall give you, then the land shall have a sabbath to the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	3	'Six years you shall sow your field, and six years you shall prune your vineyard and gather in its crop,
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	4	but during the seventh year the land shall have a sabbath rest, a sabbath to the LORD; you shall not sow your field nor prune your vineyard.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	5	'Your harvest's aftergrowth you shall not reap, and your grapes of untrimmed vines you shall not gather; the land shall have a sabbatical year.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	6	'All of you shall have the sabbath products of the land for food; yourself, and your male and female slaves, and your hired man and your foreign resident, those who live as aliens with you.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	7	'Even your cattle and the animals that are in your land shall have all its crops to eat.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	8	'You are also to count off seven sabbaths of years for yourself, seven times seven years, so that you have the time of the seven sabbaths of years, namely, forty-nine years.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	9	'You shall then sound a ram's horn abroad on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the day of atonement you shall sound a horn all through your land.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	10	'You shall thus consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim a release through the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you, and each of you shall return to his own property, and each of you shall return to his family.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	11	'You shall have the fiftieth year as a jubilee; you shall not sow, nor reap its aftergrowth, nor gather in from its untrimmed vines.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	12	'For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you. You shall eat its crops out of the field.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	13	'On this year of jubilee each of you shall return to his own property.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	14	'If you make a sale, moreover, to your friend or buy from your friend's hand, you shall not wrong one another.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	15	'Corresponding to the number of years after the jubilee, you shall buy from your friend; he is to sell to you according to the number of years of crops.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	16	'In proportion to the extent of the years you shall increase its price, and in proportion to the fewness of the years you shall diminish its price, for it is a number of crops he is selling to you.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	17	'So you shall not wrong one another, but you shall fear your God; for I am the LORD your God.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	18	'You shall thus observe My statutes and keep My judgments, so as to carry them out, that you may live securely on the land.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	19	'Then the land will yield its produce, so that you can eat your fill and live securely on it.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	20	'But if you say, "What are we going to eat on the seventh year if we do not sow or gather in our crops?"
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	21	then I will so order My blessing for you in the sixth year that it will bring forth the crop for three years.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	22	'When you are sowing the eighth year, you can still eat old things from the crop, eating the old until the ninth year when its crop comes in.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	23	'The land, moreover, shall not be sold permanently, for the land is Mine; for you are but aliens and sojourners with Me.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	24	'Thus for every piece of your property, you are to provide for the redemption of the land.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	25	'If a fellow countryman of yours becomes so poor he has to sell part of his property, then his nearest kinsman is to come and buy back what his relative has sold.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	26	'Or in case a man has no kinsman, but so recovers his means as to find sufficient for its redemption,
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	27	then he shall calculate the years since its sale and refund the balance to the man to whom he sold it, and so return to his property.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	28	'But if he has not found sufficient means to get it back for himself, then what he has sold shall remain in the hands of its purchaser until the year of jubilee; but at the jubilee it shall revert, that he may return to his property.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	29	'Likewise, if a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, then his redemption right remains valid until a full year from its sale; his right of redemption lasts a full year.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	30	'But if it is not bought back for him within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city passes permanently to its purchaser throughout his generations; it does not revert in the jubilee.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	31	'The houses of the villages, however, which have no surrounding wall shall be considered as open fields; they have redemption rights and revert in the jubilee.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	32	'As for cities of the Levites, the Levites have a permanent right of redemption for the houses of the cities which are their possession.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	33	'What, therefore, belongs to the Levites may be redeemed and a house sale in the city of this possession reverts in the jubilee, for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the sons of Israel.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	34	'But pasture fields of their cities shall not be sold, for that is their perpetual possession.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	35	'Now in case a countryman of yours becomes poor and his means with regard to you falter, then you are to sustain him, like a stranger or a sojourner, that he may live with you.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	36	'Do not take usurious interest from him, but revere your God, that your countryman may live with you.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	37	'You shall not give him your silver at interest, nor your food for gain.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	38	'I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	39	'If a countryman of yours becomes so poor with regard to you that he sells himself to you, you shall not subject him to a slave's service.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	40	'He shall be with you as a hired man, as if he were a sojourner; he shall serve with you until the year of jubilee.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	41	'He shall then go out from you, he and his sons with him, and shall go back to his family, that he may return to the property of his forefathers.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	42	'For they are My servants whom I brought out from the land of Egypt; they are not to be sold in a slave sale.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	43	'You shall not rule over him with severity, but are to revere your God.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	44	'As for your male and female slaves whom you may have--you may acquire male and female slaves from the pagan nations that are around you.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	45	'Then, too, it is out of the sons of the sojourners who live as aliens among you that you may gain acquisition, and out of their families who are with you, whom they will have produced in your land; they also may become your possession.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	46	'You may even bequeath them to your sons after you, to receive as a possession; you can use them as permanent slaves. But in respect to your countrymen, the sons of Israel, you shall not rule with severity over one another.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	47	'Now if the means of a stranger or of a sojourner with you becomes sufficient, and a countryman of yours becomes so poor with regard to him as to sell himself to a stranger who is sojourning with you, or to the descendants of a stranger's family,
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	48	then he shall have redemption right after he has been sold. One of his brothers may redeem him,
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	49	or his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or one of his blood relatives from his family may redeem him; or if he prospers, he may redeem himself.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	50	'He then with his purchaser shall calculate from the year when he sold himself to him up to the year of jubilee; and the price of his sale shall correspond to the number of years. It is like the days of a hired man that he shall be with him.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	51	'If there are still many years, he shall refund part of his purchase price in proportion to them for his own redemption;
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	52	and if few years remain until the year of jubilee, he shall so calculate with him. In proportion to his years he is to refund the amount for his redemption.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	53	'Like a man hired year by year he shall be with him; he shall not rule over him with severity in your sight.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	54	'Even if he is not redeemed by these means, he shall still go out in the year of jubilee, he and his sons with him.
Leviticus	Lev	3	25	55	'For the sons of Israel are My servants; they are My servants whom I brought out from the land of Egypt. I am the LORD your God.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	1	'You shall not make for yourselves idols, nor shall you set up for yourselves an image or a sacred pillar, nor shall you place a figured stone in your land to bow down to it; for I am the LORD your God.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	2	'You shall keep My sabbaths and reverence My sanctuary; I am the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	3	'If you walk in My statutes and keep My commandments so as to carry them out,
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	4	then I shall give you rains in their season, so that the land will yield its produce and the trees of the field will bear their fruit.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	5	'Indeed, your threshing will last for you until grape gathering, and grape gathering will last until sowing time. You will thus eat your food to the full and live securely in your land.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	6	'I shall also grant peace in the land, so that you may lie down with no one making you tremble. I shall also eliminate harmful beasts from the land, and no sword will pass through your land.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	7	'But you will chase your enemies and they will fall before you by the sword;
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	8	five of you will chase a hundred, and a hundred of you will chase ten thousand, and your enemies will fall before you by the sword.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	9	'So I will turn toward you and make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will confirm My covenant with you.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	10	'You will eat the old supply and clear out the old because of the new.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	11	'Moreover, I will make My dwelling among you, and My soul will not reject you.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	12	'I will also walk among you and be your God, and you shall be My people.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	13	'I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt so that you would not be their slaves, and I broke the bars of your yoke and made you walk erect.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	14	'But if you do not obey Me and do not carry out all these commandments,
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	15	if, instead, you reject My statutes, and if your soul abhors My ordinances so as not to carry out all My commandments, and so break My covenant,
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	16	I, in turn, will do this to you: I will appoint over you a sudden terror, consumption and fever that will waste away the eyes and cause the soul to pine away; also, you will sow your seed uselessly, for your enemies will eat it up.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	17	'I will set My face against you so that you will be struck down before your enemies; and those who hate you will rule over you, and you will flee when no one is pursuing you.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	18	'If also after these things you do not obey Me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	19	'I will also break down your pride of power; I will also make your sky like iron and your earth like bronze.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	20	'Your strength will be spent uselessly, for your land will not yield its produce and the trees of the land will not yield their fruit.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	21	'If then, you act with hostility against Me and are unwilling to obey Me, I will increase the plague on you seven times according to your sins.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	22	'I will let loose among you the beasts of the field, which will bereave you of your children and destroy your cattle and reduce your number so that your roads lie deserted.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	23	'And if by these things you are not turned to Me, but act with hostility against Me,
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	24	then I will act with hostility against you; and I, even I, will strike you seven times for your sins.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	25	'I will also bring upon you a sword which will execute vengeance for the covenant; and when you gather together into your cities, I will send pestilence among you, so that you shall be delivered into enemy hands.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	26	'When I break your staff of bread, ten women will bake your bread in one oven, and they will bring back your bread in rationed amounts, so that you will eat and not be satisfied.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	27	'Yet if in spite of this you do not obey Me, but act with hostility against Me,
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	28	then I will act with wrathful hostility against you, and I, even I, will punish you seven times for your sins.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	29	'Further, you will eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters you will eat.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	30	'I then will destroy your high places, and cut down your incense altars, and heap your remains on the remains of your idols, for My soul shall abhor you.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	31	'I will lay waste your cities as well and will make your sanctuaries desolate, and I will not smell your soothing aromas.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	32	'I will make the land desolate so that your enemies who settle in it will be appalled over it.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	33	'You, however, I will scatter among the nations and will draw out a sword after you, as your land becomes desolate and your cities become waste.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	34	'Then the land will enjoy its sabbaths all the days of the desolation, while you are in your enemies' land; then the land will rest and enjoy its sabbaths.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	35	'All the days of its desolation it will observe the rest which it did not observe on your sabbaths, while you were living on it.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	36	'As for those of you who may be left, I will also bring weakness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies. And the sound of a driven leaf will chase them, and even when no one is pursuing they will flee as though from the sword, and they will fall.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	37	'They will therefore stumble over each other as if running from the sword, although no one is pursuing; and you will have no strength to stand up before your enemies.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	38	'But you will perish among the nations, and your enemies' land will consume you.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	39	'So those of you who may be left will rot away because of their iniquity in the lands of your enemies; and also because of the iniquities of their forefathers they will rot away with them.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	40	'If they confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their forefathers, in their unfaithfulness which they committed against Me, and also in their acting with hostility against Me--
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	41	I also was acting with hostility against them, to bring them into the land of their enemies--or if their uncircumcised heart becomes humbled so that they then make amends for their iniquity,
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	42	then I will remember My covenant with Jacob, and I will remember also My covenant with Isaac, and My covenant with Abraham as well, and I will remember the land.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	43	'For the land will be abandoned by them, and will make up for its sabbaths while it is made desolate without them. They, meanwhile, will be making amends for their iniquity, because they rejected My ordinances and their soul abhorred My statutes.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	44	'Yet in spite of this, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, nor will I so abhor them as to destroy them, breaking My covenant with them; for I am the LORD their God.
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	45	'But I will remember for them the covenant with their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God. I am the LORD.'"
Leviticus	Lev	3	26	46	These are the statutes and ordinances and laws which the LORD established between Himself and the sons of Israel through Moses at Mount Sinai.
Leviticus	Lev	3	27	1	Again, the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus	Lev	3	27	2	"Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'When a man makes a difficult vow, he shall be valued according to your valuation of persons belonging to the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	27	3	'If your valuation is of the male from twenty years even to sixty years old, then your valuation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.
Leviticus	Lev	3	27	4	'Or if it is a female, then your valuation shall be thirty shekels.
Leviticus	Lev	3	27	5	'If it be from five years even to twenty years old then your valuation for the male shall be twenty shekels and for the female ten shekels.
Leviticus	Lev	3	27	6	'But if they are from a month even up to five years old, then your valuation shall be five shekels of silver for the male, and for the female your valuation shall be three shekels of silver.
Leviticus	Lev	3	27	7	'If they are from sixty years old and upward, if it is a male, then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
Leviticus	Lev	3	27	8	'But if he is poorer than your valuation, then he shall be placed before the priest and the priest shall value him; according to the means of the one who vowed, the priest shall value him.
Leviticus	Lev	3	27	9	'Now if it is an animal of the kind which men can present as an offering to the LORD, any such that one gives to the LORD shall be holy.
Leviticus	Lev	3	27	10	'He shall not replace it or exchange it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; or if he does exchange animal for animal, then both it and its substitute shall become holy.
Leviticus	Lev	3	27	11	'If, however, it is any unclean animal of the kind which men do not present as an offering to the LORD, then he shall place the animal before the priest.
Leviticus	Lev	3	27	12	'The priest shall value it as either good or bad; as you, the priest, value it, so it shall be.
Leviticus	Lev	3	27	13	'But if he should ever wish to redeem it, then he shall add one-fifth of it to your valuation.
Leviticus	Lev	3	27	14	'Now if a man consecrates his house as holy to the LORD, then the priest shall value it as either good or bad; as the priest values it, so it shall stand.
Leviticus	Lev	3	27	15	'Yet if the one who consecrates it should wish to redeem his house, then he shall add one-fifth of your valuation price to it, so that it may be his.
Leviticus	Lev	3	27	16	'Again, if a man consecrates to the LORD part of the fields of his own property, then your valuation shall be proportionate to the seed needed for it: a homer of barley seed at fifty shekels of silver.
Leviticus	Lev	3	27	17	'If he consecrates his field as of the year of jubilee, according to your valuation it shall stand.
Leviticus	Lev	3	27	18	'If he consecrates his field after the jubilee, however, then the priest shall calculate the price for him proportionate to the years that are left until the year of jubilee; and it shall be deducted from your valuation.
Leviticus	Lev	3	27	19	'If the one who consecrates it should ever wish to redeem the field, then he shall add one-fifth of your valuation price to it, so that it may pass to him.
Leviticus	Lev	3	27	20	'Yet if he will not redeem the field, but has sold the field to another man, it may no longer be redeemed;
Leviticus	Lev	3	27	21	and when it reverts in the jubilee, the field shall be holy to the LORD, like a field set apart; it shall be for the priest as his property.
Leviticus	Lev	3	27	22	'Or if he consecrates to the LORD a field which he has bought, which is not a part of the field of his own property,
Leviticus	Lev	3	27	23	then the priest shall calculate for him the amount of your valuation up to the year of jubilee; and he shall on that day give your valuation as holy to the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	27	24	'In the year of jubilee the field shall return to the one from whom he bought it, to whom the possession of the land belongs.
Leviticus	Lev	3	27	25	'Every valuation of yours, moreover, shall be after the shekel of the sanctuary. The shekel shall be twenty gerahs.
Leviticus	Lev	3	27	26	'However, a firstborn among animals, which as a firstborn belongs to the LORD, no man may consecrate it; whether ox or sheep, it is the LORD'S.
Leviticus	Lev	3	27	27	'But if it is among the unclean animals, then he shall redeem it according to your valuation and add to it one-fifth of it; and if it is not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your valuation.
Leviticus	Lev	3	27	28	'Nevertheless, anything which a man sets apart to the LORD out of all that he has, of man or animal or of the fields of his own property, shall not be sold or redeemed. Anything devoted to destruction is most holy to the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	27	29	'No one who may have been set apart among men shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death.
Leviticus	Lev	3	27	30	'Thus all the tithe of the land, of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD'S; it is holy to the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	27	31	'If, therefore, a man wishes to redeem part of his tithe, he shall add to it one-fifth of it.
Leviticus	Lev	3	27	32	'For every tenth part of herd or flock, whatever passes under the rod, the tenth one shall be holy to the LORD.
Leviticus	Lev	3	27	33	'He is not to be concerned whether it is good or bad, nor shall he exchange it; or if he does exchange it, then both it and its substitute shall become holy. It shall not be redeemed.'"
Leviticus	Lev	3	27	34	These are the commandments which the LORD commanded Moses for the sons of Israel at Mount Sinai.
Numbers	Num	4	1	1	Then the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tent of meeting, on the first of the second month, in the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	1	2	"Take a census of all the congregation of the sons of Israel, by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, every male, head by head
Numbers	Num	4	1	3	from twenty years old and upward, whoever is able to go out to war in Israel, you and Aaron shall number them by their armies.
Numbers	Num	4	1	4	"With you, moreover, there shall be a man of each tribe, each one head of his father's household.
Numbers	Num	4	1	5	"These then are the names of the men who shall stand with you: of Reuben, Elizur the son of Shedeur;
Numbers	Num	4	1	6	of Simeon, Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai;

Numbers	Num	4	1	16	"These are they who were called of the congregation, the leaders of their fathers' tribes; they were the heads of divisions of Israel."
Numbers	Num	4	1	17	So Moses and Aaron took these men who had been designated by name,
Numbers	Num	4	1	18	and they assembled all the congregation together on the first of the second month. Then they registered by ancestry in their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, head by head,
Numbers	Num	4	1	19	just as the LORD had commanded Moses. So he numbered them in the wilderness of Sinai.
Numbers	Num	4	1	20	Now the sons of Reuben, Israel's firstborn, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, head by head, every male from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war,

Numbers	Num	4	1	37	their numbered men of the tribe of Benjamin were 35,400.
Numbers	Num	4	1	38	Of the sons of Dan, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war,
Numbers	Num	4	1	39	their numbered men of the tribe of Dan were 62,700.
Numbers	Num	4	1	40	Of the sons of Asher, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war,
Numbers	Num	4	1	41	their numbered men of the tribe of Asher were 41,500.
Numbers	Num	4	1	42	Of the sons of Naphtali, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war,
Numbers	Num	4	1	43	their numbered men of the tribe of Naphtali were 53,400.
Numbers	Num	4	1	44	These are the ones who were numbered, whom Moses and Aaron numbered, with the leaders of Israel, twelve men, each of whom was of his father's household.
Numbers	Num	4	1	45	So all the numbered men of the sons of Israel by their fathers' households, from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war in Israel,
Numbers	Num	4	1	46	even all the numbered men were 603,550.
Numbers	Num	4	1	47	The Levites, however, were not numbered among them by their fathers' tribe.
Numbers	Num	4	1	48	For the LORD had spoken to Moses, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	1	49	"Only the tribe of Levi you shall not number, nor shall you take their census among the sons of Israel.
Numbers	Num	4	1	50	"But you shall appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony, and over all its furnishings and over all that belongs to it. They shall carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings, and they shall take care of it; they shall also camp around the tabernacle.
Numbers	Num	4	1	51	"So when the tabernacle is to set out, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle encamps, the Levites shall set it up. But the layman who comes near shall be put to death.
Numbers	Num	4	1	52	"The sons of Israel shall camp, each man by his own camp, and each man by his own standard, according to their armies.
Numbers	Num	4	1	53	"But the Levites shall camp around the tabernacle of the testimony, so that there will be no wrath on the congregation of the sons of Israel. So the Levites shall keep charge of the tabernacle of the testimony."
Numbers	Num	4	1	54	Thus the sons of Israel did; according to all which the LORD had commanded Moses, so they did.
Numbers	Num	4	2	1	Now the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	2	2	"The sons of Israel shall camp, each by his own standard, with the banners of their fathers' households; they shall camp around the tent of meeting at a distance.
Numbers	Num	4	2	3	"Now those who camp on the east side toward the sunrise shall be of the standard of the camp of Judah, by their armies, and the leader of the sons of Judah: Nahshon the son of Amminadab,
Numbers	Num	4	2	4	and his army, even their numbered men, 74,600.
Numbers	Num	4	2	5	"Those who camp next to him shall be the tribe of Issachar, and the leader of the sons of Issachar: Nethanel the son of Zuar,
Numbers	Num	4	2	6	and his army, even their numbered men, 54,400.
Numbers	Num	4	2	7	"Then comes the tribe of Zebulun, and the leader of the sons of Zebulun: Eliab the son of Helon,
Numbers	Num	4	2	8	and his army, even his numbered men, 57,400.
Numbers	Num	4	2	9	"The total of the numbered men of the camp of Judah: 186,400, by their armies. They shall set out first.
Numbers	Num	4	2	10	"On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben by their armies, and the leader of the sons of Reuben: Elizur the son of Shedeur,
Numbers	Num	4	2	11	and his army, even their numbered men, 46,500.
Numbers	Num	4	2	12	"Those who camp next to him shall be the tribe of Simeon, and the leader of the sons of Simeon: Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai,
Numbers	Num	4	2	13	and his army, even their numbered men, 59,300.
Numbers	Num	4	2	14	"Then comes the tribe of Gad, and the leader of the sons of Gad: Eliasaph the son of Deuel,
Numbers	Num	4	2	15	and his army, even their numbered men, 45,650.
Numbers	Num	4	2	16	"The total of the numbered men of the camp of Reuben: 151,by their armies. And they shall set out second.
Numbers	Num	4	2	17	"Then the tent of meeting shall set out with the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camps; just as they camp, so they shall set out, every man in his place by their standards.
Numbers	Num	4	2	18	"On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim by their armies, and the leader of the sons of Ephraim shall be Elishama the son of Ammihud,
Numbers	Num	4	2	19	and his army, even their numbered men, 40,500.
Numbers	Num	4	2	20	"Next to him shall be the tribe of Manasseh, and the leader of the sons of Manasseh: Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur,
Numbers	Num	4	2	21	and his army, even their numbered men, 32,200.
Numbers	Num	4	2	22	"Then comes the tribe of Benjamin, and the leader of the sons of Benjamin: Abidan the son of Gideoni,
Numbers	Num	4	2	23	and his army, even their numbered men, 35,400.
Numbers	Num	4	2	24	"The total of the numbered men of the camp of Ephraim: 108,100, by their armies. And they shall set out third.
Numbers	Num	4	2	25	"On the north side shall be the standard of the camp of Dan by their armies, and the leader of the sons of Dan: Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai,
Numbers	Num	4	2	26	and his army, even their numbered men, 62,700.
Numbers	Num	4	2	27	"Those who camp next to him shall be the tribe of Asher, and the leader of the sons of Asher: Pagiel the son of Ochran,
Numbers	Num	4	2	28	and his army, even their numbered men, 41,500.
Numbers	Num	4	2	29	"Then comes the tribe of Naphtali, and the leader of the sons of Naphtali: Ahira the son of Enan,
Numbers	Num	4	2	30	and his army, even their numbered men, 53,400.
Numbers	Num	4	2	31	"The total of the numbered men of the camp of Dan was 157,600. They shall set out last by their standards."
Numbers	Num	4	2	32	These are the numbered men of the sons of Israel by their fathers' households; the total of the numbered men of the camps by their armies, 603,550.
Numbers	Num	4	2	33	The Levites, however, were not numbered among the sons of Israel, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Numbers	Num	4	2	34	Thus the sons of Israel did; according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so they camped by their standards, and so they set out, every one by his family according to his father's household.
Numbers	Num	4	3	1	Now these are the records of the generations of Aaron and Moses at the time when the LORD spoke with Moses on Mount Sinai.
Numbers	Num	4	3	2	These then are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
Numbers	Num	4	3	3	These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the anointed priests, whom he ordained to serve as priests.
Numbers	Num	4	3	4	But Nadab and Abihu died before the LORD when they offered strange fire before the LORD in the wilderness of Sinai; and they had no children. So Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests in the lifetime of their father Aaron.
Numbers	Num	4	3	5	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	3	6	"Bring the tribe of Levi near and set them before Aaron the priest, that they may serve him.
Numbers	Num	4	3	7	"They shall perform the duties for him and for the whole congregation before the tent of meeting, to do the service of the tabernacle.
Numbers	Num	4	3	8	"They shall also keep all the furnishings of the tent of meeting, along with the duties of the sons of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle.
Numbers	Num	4	3	9	"You shall thus give the Levites to Aaron and to his sons; they are wholly given to him from among the sons of Israel.
Numbers	Num	4	3	10	"So you shall appoint Aaron and his sons that they may keep their priesthood, but the layman who comes near shall be put to death."
Numbers	Num	4	3	11	Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	3	12	"Now, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the sons of Israel instead of every firstborn, the first issue of the womb among the sons of Israel. So the Levites shall be Mine.
Numbers	Num	4	3	13	"For all the firstborn are Mine; on the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I sanctified to Myself all the firstborn in Israel, from man to beast. They shall be Mine; I am the LORD."
Numbers	Num	4	3	14	Then the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	3	15	"Number the sons of Levi by their fathers' households, by their families; every male from a month old and upward you shall number."
Numbers	Num	4	3	16	So Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD, just as he had been commanded.
Numbers	Num	4	3	17	These then are the sons of Levi by their names: Gershon and Kohath and Merari.
Numbers	Num	4	3	18	These are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families: Libni and Shimei;
Numbers	Num	4	3	19	and the sons of Kohath by their families: Amram and Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel;
Numbers	Num	4	3	20	and the sons of Merari by their families: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their fathers' households.
Numbers	Num	4	3	21	Of Gershon was the family of the Libnites and the family of the Shimeites; these were the families of the Gershonites.
Numbers	Num	4	3	22	Their numbered men, in the numbering of every male from a month old and upward, even their numbered men were 7,500.
Numbers	Num	4	3	23	The families of the Gershonites were to camp behind the tabernacle westward,
Numbers	Num	4	3	24	and the leader of the fathers' households of the Gershonites was Eliasaph the son of Lael.
Numbers	Num	4	3	25	Now the duties of the sons of Gershon in the tent of meeting involved the tabernacle and the tent, its covering, and the screen for the doorway of the tent of meeting,
Numbers	Num	4	3	26	and the hangings of the court, and the screen for the doorway of the court which is around the tabernacle and the altar, and its cords, according to all the service concerning them.
Numbers	Num	4	3	27	Of Kohath was the family of the Amramites and the family of the Izharites and the family of the Hebronites and the family of the Uzzielites; these were the families of the Kohathites.
Numbers	Num	4	3	28	In the numbering of every male from a month old and upward, there were 8,600, performing the duties of the sanctuary.
Numbers	Num	4	3	29	The families of the sons of Kohath were to camp on the southward side of the tabernacle,
Numbers	Num	4	3	30	and the leader of the fathers' households of the Kohathite families was Elizaphan the son of Uzziel.
Numbers	Num	4	3	31	Now their duties involved the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, and the utensils of the sanctuary with which they minister, and the screen, and all the service concerning them;
Numbers	Num	4	3	32	and Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest was the chief of the leaders of Levi, and had the oversight of those who perform the duties of the sanctuary.
Numbers	Num	4	3	33	Of Merari was the family of the Mahlites and the family of the Mushites; these were the families of Merari.
Numbers	Num	4	3	34	Their numbered men in the numbering of every male from a month old and upward, were 6,200.
Numbers	Num	4	3	35	The leader of the fathers' households of the families of Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail. They were to camp on the northward side of the tabernacle.
Numbers	Num	4	3	36	Now the appointed duties of the sons of Merari involved the frames of the tabernacle, its bars, its pillars, its sockets, all its equipment, and the service concerning them,
Numbers	Num	4	3	37	and the pillars around the court with their sockets and their pegs and their cords.
Numbers	Num	4	3	38	Now those who were to camp before the tabernacle eastward, before the tent of meeting toward the sunrise, are Moses and Aaron and his sons, performing the duties of the sanctuary for the obligation of the sons of Israel; but the layman coming near was to be put to death.
Numbers	Num	4	3	39	All the numbered men of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron numbered at the command of the LORD by their families, every male from a month old and upward, were 22,000.
Numbers	Num	4	3	40	Then the LORD said to Moses, "Number every firstborn male of the sons of Israel from a month old and upward, and make a list of their names.
Numbers	Num	4	3	41	"You shall take the Levites for Me, I am the LORD, instead of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the cattle of the sons of Israel."
Numbers	Num	4	3	42	So Moses numbered all the firstborn among the sons of Israel, just as the LORD had commanded him;
Numbers	Num	4	3	43	and all the firstborn males by the number of names from a month old and upward, for their numbered men were 22,273.
Numbers	Num	4	3	44	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	3	45	"Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel and the cattle of the Levites. And the Levites shall be Mine; I am the LORD.
Numbers	Num	4	3	46	"For the ransom of the of the firstborn of the sons of Israel who are in excess beyond the Levites,
Numbers	Num	4	3	47	you shall take five shekels apiece, per head; you shall take them in terms of the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel is twenty gerahs),
Numbers	Num	4	3	48	and give the money, the ransom of those who are in excess among them, to Aaron and to his sons."
Numbers	Num	4	3	49	So Moses took the ransom money from those who were in excess, beyond those ransomed by the Levites;
Numbers	Num	4	3	50	from the firstborn of the sons of Israel he took the money in terms of the shekel of the sanctuary, 1,365.
Numbers	Num	4	3	51	Then Moses gave the ransom money to Aaron and to his sons, at the command of the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Numbers	Num	4	4	1	Then the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	4	2	"Take a census of the descendants of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, by their families, by their fathers' households,
Numbers	Num	4	4	3	from thirty years and upward, even to fifty years old, all who enter the service to do the work in the tent of meeting.
Numbers	Num	4	4	4	"This is the work of the descendants of Kohath in the tent of meeting, concerning the most holy things.
Numbers	Num	4	4	5	"When the camp sets out, Aaron and his sons shall go in and they shall take down the veil of the screen and cover the ark of the testimony with it;
Numbers	Num	4	4	6	and they shall lay a covering of porpoise skin on it, and shall spread over it a cloth of pure blue, and shall insert its poles.
Numbers	Num	4	4	7	"Over the table of the bread of the Presence they shall also spread a cloth of blue and put on it the dishes and the pans and the sacrificial bowls and the jars for the drink offering, and the continual bread shall be on it.
Numbers	Num	4	4	8	"They shall spread over them a cloth of scarlet material, and cover the same with a covering of porpoise skin, and they shall insert its poles.
Numbers	Num	4	4	9	"Then they shall take a blue cloth and cover the lampstand for the light, along with its lamps and its snuffers, and its trays and all its oil vessels, by which they serve it;
Numbers	Num	4	4	10	and they shall put it and all its utensils in a covering of porpoise skin, and shall put it on the carrying bars.
Numbers	Num	4	4	11	"Over the golden altar they shall spread a blue cloth and cover it with a covering of porpoise skin, and shall insert its poles;
Numbers	Num	4	4	12	and they shall take all the utensils of service, with which they serve in the sanctuary, and put them in a blue cloth and cover them with a covering of porpoise skin, and put them on the carrying bars.
Numbers	Num	4	4	13	"Then they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread a purple cloth over it.
Numbers	Num	4	4	14	"They shall also put on it all its utensils by which they serve in connection with it: the firepans, the forks and shovels and the basins, all the utensils of the altar; and they shall spread a cover of porpoise skin over it and insert its poles.
Numbers	Num	4	4	15	"When Aaron and his sons have finished covering the holy objects and all the furnishings of the sanctuary, when the camp is to set out, after that the sons of Kohath shall come to carry them, so that they will not touch the holy objects and die. These are the things in the tent of meeting which the sons of Kohath are to carry.
Numbers	Num	4	4	16	"The responsibility of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest is the oil for the light and the fragrant incense and the continual grain offering and the anointing oil--the responsibility of all the tabernacle and of all that is in it, with the sanctuary and its furnishings."
Numbers	Num	4	4	17	Then the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	4	18	"Do not let the tribe of the families of the Kohathites be cut off from among the Levites.
Numbers	Num	4	4	19	"But do this to them that they may live and not die when they approach the most holy objects: Aaron and his sons shall go in and assign each of them to his work and to his load;
Numbers	Num	4	4	20	but they shall not go in to see the holy objects even for a moment, or they will die."
Numbers	Num	4	4	21	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	4	22	"Take a census of the sons of Gershon also, by their fathers' households, by their families;
Numbers	Num	4	4	23	from thirty years and upward to fifty years old, you shall number them; all who enter to perform the service to do the work in the tent of meeting.
Numbers	Num	4	4	24	"This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, in serving and in carrying:
Numbers	Num	4	4	25	they shall carry the curtains of the tabernacle and the tent of meeting with its covering and the covering of porpoise skin that is on top of it, and the screen for the doorway of the tent of meeting,
Numbers	Num	4	4	26	and the hangings of the court, and the screen for the doorway of the gate of the court which is around the tabernacle and the altar, and their cords and all the equipment for their service; and all that is to be done, they shall perform.
Numbers	Num	4	4	27	"All the service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their loads and in all their work, shall be performed at the command of Aaron and his sons; and you shall assign to them as a duty all their loads.
Numbers	Num	4	4	28	"This is the service of the families of the sons of the Gershonites in the tent of meeting, and their duties shall be under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
Numbers	Num	4	4	29	"As for the sons of Merari, you shall number them by their families, by their fathers' households;
Numbers	Num	4	4	30	from thirty years and upward even to fifty years old, you shall number them, everyone who enters the service to do the work of the tent of meeting.
Numbers	Num	4	4	31	"Now this is the duty of their loads, for all their service in the tent of meeting: the boards of the tabernacle and its bars and its pillars and its sockets,
Numbers	Num	4	4	32	and the pillars around the court and their sockets and their pegs and their cords, with all their equipment and with all their service; and you shall assign each man by name the items he is to carry.
Numbers	Num	4	4	33	"This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari, according to all their service in the tent of meeting, under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest."
Numbers	Num	4	4	34	So Moses and Aaron and the leaders of the congregation numbered the sons of the Kohathites by their families and by their fathers' households,
Numbers	Num	4	4	35	from thirty years and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who entered the service for work in the tent of meeting.
Numbers	Num	4	4	36	Their numbered men by their families were 2,750.
Numbers	Num	4	4	37	These are the numbered men of the Kohathite families, everyone who was serving in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of the LORD through Moses.
Numbers	Num	4	4	38	The numbered men of the sons of Gershon by their families and by their fathers' households,
Numbers	Num	4	4	39	from thirty years and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who entered the service for work in the tent of meeting.
Numbers	Num	4	4	40	Their numbered men by their families, by their fathers' households, were 2,630.
Numbers	Num	4	4	41	These are the numbered men of the families of the sons of Gershon, everyone who was serving in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of the LORD.
Numbers	Num	4	4	42	The numbered men of the families of the sons of Merari by their families, by their fathers' households,
Numbers	Num	4	4	43	from thirty years and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who entered the service for work in the tent of meeting.
Numbers	Num	4	4	44	Their numbered men by their families were 3,200.
Numbers	Num	4	4	45	These are the numbered men of the families of the sons of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of the LORD through Moses.
Numbers	Num	4	4	46	All the numbered men of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron and the leaders of Israel numbered, by their families and by their fathers' households,
Numbers	Num	4	4	47	from thirty years and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who could enter to do the work of service and the work of carrying in the tent of meeting.
Numbers	Num	4	4	48	Their numbered men were 8,580.
Numbers	Num	4	4	49	According to the commandment of the LORD through Moses, they were numbered, everyone by his serving or carrying; thus these were his numbered men, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Numbers	Num	4	5	1	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	5	2	"Command the sons of Israel that they send away from the camp every leper and everyone having a discharge and everyone who is unclean because of a dead person.
Numbers	Num	4	5	3	"You shall send away both male and female; you shall send them outside the camp so that they will not defile their camp where I dwell in their midst."
Numbers	Num	4	5	4	The sons of Israel did so and sent them outside the camp; just as the LORD had spoken to Moses, thus the sons of Israel did.
Numbers	Num	4	5	5	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	5	6	"Speak to the sons of Israel, 'When a man or woman commits any of the sins of mankind, acting unfaithfully against the LORD, and that person is guilty,
Numbers	Num	4	5	7	then he shall confess his sins which he has committed, and he shall make restitution in full for his wrong and add to it one-fifth of it, and give it to him whom he has wronged.
Numbers	Num	4	5	8	'But if the man has no relative to whom restitution may be made for the wrong, the restitution which is made for the wrong must go to the LORD for the priest, besides the ram of atonement, by which atonement is made for him.
Numbers	Num	4	5	9	'Also every contribution pertaining to all the holy gifts of the sons of Israel, which they offer to the priest, shall be his.
Numbers	Num	4	5	10	'So every man's holy gifts shall be his; whatever any man gives to the priest, it becomes his.'"
Numbers	Num	4	5	11	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	5	12	"Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'If any man's wife goes astray and is unfaithful to him,
Numbers	Num	4	5	13	and a man has intercourse with her and it is hidden from the eyes of her husband and she is undetected, although she has defiled herself, and there is no witness against her and she has not been caught in the act,
Numbers	Num	4	5	14	if a spirit of jealousy comes over him and he is jealous of his wife when she has defiled herself, or if a spirit of jealousy comes over him and he is jealous of his wife when she has not defiled herself,
Numbers	Num	4	5	15	the man shall then bring his wife to the priest, and shall bring as an offering for her one-tenth of an ephah of barley meal; he shall not pour oil on it nor put frankincense on it, for it is a grain offering of jealousy, a grain offering of memorial, a reminder of iniquity.
Numbers	Num	4	5	16	'Then the priest shall bring her near and have her stand before the LORD,
Numbers	Num	4	5	17	and the priest shall take holy water in an earthenware vessel; and he shall take some of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle and put it into the water.
Numbers	Num	4	5	18	'The priest shall then have the woman stand before the LORD and let the hair of the woman's head go loose, and place the grain offering of memorial in her hands, which is the grain offering of jealousy, and in the hand of the priest is to be the water of bitterness that brings a curse.
Numbers	Num	4	5	19	'The priest shall have her take an oath and shall say to the woman, "If no man has lain with you and if you have not gone astray into uncleanness, being under the authority of your husband, be immune to this water of bitterness that brings a curse;
Numbers	Num	4	5	20	if you, however, have gone astray, being under the authority of your husband, and if you have defiled yourself and a man other than your husband has had intercourse with you"
Numbers	Num	4	5	21	(then the priest shall have the woman swear with the oath of the curse, and the priest shall say to the woman), "the LORD make you a curse and an oath among your people by the LORD'S making your thigh waste away and your abdomen swell;
Numbers	Num	4	5	22	and this water that brings a curse shall go into your stomach, and make your abdomen swell and your thigh waste away." And the woman shall say, "Amen. Amen."
Numbers	Num	4	5	23	'The priest shall then write these curses on a scroll, and he shall wash them off into the water of bitterness.
Numbers	Num	4	5	24	'Then he shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that brings a curse, so that the water which brings a curse will go into her and cause bitterness.
Numbers	Num	4	5	25	'The priest shall take the grain offering of jealousy from the woman's hand, and he shall wave the grain offering before the LORD and bring it to the altar;
Numbers	Num	4	5	26	and the priest shall take a handful of the grain offering as its memorial offering and offer it up in smoke on the altar, and afterward he shall make the woman drink the water.
Numbers	Num	4	5	27	'When he has made her drink the water, then it shall come about, if she has defiled herself and has been unfaithful to her husband, that the water which brings a curse will go into her and cause bitterness, and her abdomen will swell and her thigh will waste away, and the woman will become a curse among her people.
Numbers	Num	4	5	28	'But if the woman has not defiled herself and is clean, she will then be free and conceive children.
Numbers	Num	4	5	29	'This is the law of jealousy: when a wife, being under the authority of her husband, goes astray and defiles herself,
Numbers	Num	4	5	30	or when a spirit of jealousy comes over a man and he is jealous of his wife, he shall then make the woman stand before the LORD, and the priest shall apply all this law to her.
Numbers	Num	4	5	31	'Moreover, the man will be free from guilt, but that woman shall bear her guilt.'"
Numbers	Num	4	6	1	Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	6	2	"Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'When a man or woman makes a special vow, the vow of a Nazirite, to dedicate himself to the LORD,
Numbers	Num	4	6	3	he shall abstain from wine and strong drink; he shall drink no vinegar, whether made from wine or strong drink, nor shall he drink any grape juice nor eat fresh or dried grapes.
Numbers	Num	4	6	4	'All the days of his separation he shall not eat anything that is produced by the grape vine, from the seeds even to the skin.
Numbers	Num	4	6	5	'All the days of his vow of separation no razor shall pass over his head. He shall be holy until the days are fulfilled for which he separated himself to the LORD; he shall let the locks of hair on his head grow long.
Numbers	Num	4	6	6	'All the days of his separation to the LORD he shall not go near to a dead person.
Numbers	Num	4	6	7	'He shall not make himself unclean for his father or for his mother, for his brother or for his sister, when they die, because his separation to God is on his head.
Numbers	Num	4	6	8	'All the days of his separation he is holy to the LORD.
Numbers	Num	4	6	9	'But if a man dies very suddenly beside him and he defiles his dedicated head of hair, then he shall shave his head on the day when he becomes clean; he shall shave it on the seventh day.
Numbers	Num	4	6	10	'Then on the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest, to the doorway of the tent of meeting.
Numbers	Num	4	6	11	'The priest shall offer one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering, and make atonement for him concerning his sin because of the dead person. And that same day he shall consecrate his head,
Numbers	Num	4	6	12	and shall dedicate to the LORD his days as a Nazirite, and shall bring a male lamb a year old for a guilt offering; but the former days will be void because his separation was defiled.
Numbers	Num	4	6	13	'Now this is the law of the Nazirite when the days of his separation are fulfilled, he shall bring the offering to the doorway of the tent of meeting.
Numbers	Num	4	6	14	'He shall present his offering to the LORD: one male lamb a year old without defect for a burnt offering and one ewe-lamb a year old without defect for a sin offering and one ram without defect for a peace offering,
Numbers	Num	4	6	15	and a basket of unleavened cakes of fine flour mixed with oil and unleavened wafers spread with oil, along with their grain offering and their drink offering.
Numbers	Num	4	6	16	'Then the priest shall present them before the LORD and shall offer his sin offering and his burnt offering.
Numbers	Num	4	6	17	'He shall also offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD, together with the basket of unleavened cakes; the priest shall likewise offer its grain offering and its drink offering.
Numbers	Num	4	6	18	'The Nazirite shall then shave his dedicated head of hair at the doorway of the tent of meeting, and take the dedicated hair of his head and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace offerings.
Numbers	Num	4	6	19	'The priest shall take the ram's shoulder when it has been boiled, and one unleavened cake out of the basket and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them on the hands of the Nazirite after he has shaved his dedicated hair.
Numbers	Num	4	6	20	'Then the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD. It is holy for the priest, together with the breast offered by waving and the thigh offered by lifting up; and afterward the Nazirite may drink wine.'
Numbers	Num	4	6	21	"This is the law of the Nazirite who vows his offering to the LORD according to his separation, in addition to what else he can afford; according to his vow which he takes, so he shall do according to the law of his separation."
Numbers	Num	4	6	22	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	6	23	"Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, 'Thus you shall bless the sons of Israel. You shall say to them:
Numbers	Num	4	6	24	The LORD bless you, and keep you;
Numbers	Num	4	6	25	The LORD make His face shine on you, And be gracious to you;
Numbers	Num	4	6	26	The LORD lift up His countenance on you, And give you peace.'
Numbers	Num	4	6	27	"So they shall invoke My name on the sons of Israel, and I then will bless them."
Numbers	Num	4	7	1	Now on the day that Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle, he anointed it and consecrated it with all its furnishings and the altar and all its utensils; he anointed them and consecrated them also.
Numbers	Num	4	7	2	Then the leaders of Israel, the heads of their fathers' households, made an offering (they were the leaders of the tribes; they were the ones who were over the numbered men).
Numbers	Num	4	7	3	When they brought their offering before the LORD, six covered carts and twelve oxen, a cart for every two of the leaders and an ox for each one, then they presented them before the tabernacle.
Numbers	Num	4	7	4	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	7	5	"Accept these things from them, that they may be used in the service of the tent of meeting, and you shall give them to the Levites, to each man according to his service."
Numbers	Num	4	7	6	So Moses took the carts and the oxen and gave them to the Levites.
Numbers	Num	4	7	7	Two carts and four oxen he gave to the sons of Gershon, according to their service,
Numbers	Num	4	7	8	and four carts and eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merari, according to their service, under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
Numbers	Num	4	7	9	But he did not give any to the sons of Kohath because theirs was the service of the holy objects, which they carried on the shoulder.
Numbers	Num	4	7	10	The leaders offered the dedication offering for the altar when it was anointed, so the leaders offered their offering before the altar.
Numbers	Num	4	7	11	Then the LORD said to Moses, "Let them present their offering, one leader each day, for the dedication of the altar."
Numbers	Num	4	7	12	Now the one who presented his offering on the first day was Nahshon the son of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah;
Numbers	Num	4	7	13	and his offering was one silver dish whose weight was one hundred and thirty shekels, one silver bowl of seventy shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering;

Numbers	Num	4	7	89	Now when Moses went into the tent of meeting to speak with Him, he heard the voice speaking to him from above the mercy seat that was on the ark of the testimony, from between the two cherubim, so He spoke to him.
Numbers	Num	4	8	1	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	8	2	"Speak to Aaron and say to him, 'When you mount the lamps, the seven lamps will give light in the front of the lampstand.'"
Numbers	Num	4	8	3	Aaron therefore did so; he mounted its lamps at the front of the lampstand, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Numbers	Num	4	8	4	Now this was the workmanship of the lampstand, hammered work of gold; from its base to its flowers it was hammered work; according to the pattern which the LORD had shown Moses, so he made the lampstand.
Numbers	Num	4	8	5	Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	8	6	"Take the Levites from among the sons of Israel and cleanse them.
Numbers	Num	4	8	7	"Thus you shall do to them, for their cleansing: sprinkle purifying water on them, and let them use a razor over their whole body and wash their clothes, and they will be clean.
Numbers	Num	4	8	8	"Then let them take a bull with its grain offering, fine flour mixed with oil; and a second bull you shall take for a sin offering.
Numbers	Num	4	8	9	"So you shall present the Levites before the tent of meeting. You shall also assemble the whole congregation of the sons of Israel,
Numbers	Num	4	8	10	and present the Levites before the LORD; and the sons of Israel shall lay their hands on the Levites.
Numbers	Num	4	8	11	"Aaron then shall present the Levites before the LORD as a wave offering from the sons of Israel, that they may qualify to perform the service of the LORD.
Numbers	Num	4	8	12	"Now the Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls; then offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering to the LORD, to make atonement for the Levites.
Numbers	Num	4	8	13	"You shall have the Levites stand before Aaron and before his sons so as to present them as a wave offering to the LORD.
Numbers	Num	4	8	14	"Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the sons of Israel, and the Levites shall be Mine.
Numbers	Num	4	8	15	"Then after that the Levites may go in to serve the tent of meeting. But you shall cleanse them and present them as a wave offering;
Numbers	Num	4	8	16	for they are wholly given to Me from among the sons of Israel. I have taken them for Myself instead of every first issue of the womb, the firstborn of all the sons of Israel.
Numbers	Num	4	8	17	"For every firstborn among the sons of Israel is Mine, among the men and among the animals; on the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for Myself.
Numbers	Num	4	8	18	"But I have taken the Levites instead of every firstborn among the sons of Israel.
Numbers	Num	4	8	19	"I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the sons of Israel, to perform the service of the sons of Israel at the tent of meeting and to make atonement on behalf of the sons of Israel, so that there will be no plague among the sons of Israel by their coming near to the sanctuary."
Numbers	Num	4	8	20	Thus did Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the sons of Israel to the Levites; according to all that the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so the sons of Israel did to them.
Numbers	Num	4	8	21	The Levites, too, purified themselves from sin and washed their clothes; and Aaron presented them as a wave offering before the LORD. Aaron also made atonement for them to cleanse them.
Numbers	Num	4	8	22	Then after that the Levites went in to perform their service in the tent of meeting before Aaron and before his sons; just as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so they did to them.
Numbers	Num	4	8	23	Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	8	24	"This is what applies to the Levites: from twenty-five years old and upward they shall enter to perform service in the work of the tent of meeting.
Numbers	Num	4	8	25	"But at the age of fifty years they shall retire from service in the work and not work any more.
Numbers	Num	4	8	26	"They may, however, assist their brothers in the tent of meeting, to keep an obligation, but they themselves shall do no work. Thus you shall deal with the Levites concerning their obligations."
Numbers	Num	4	9	1	Thus the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	9	2	"Now, let the sons of Israel observe the Passover at its appointed time.
Numbers	Num	4	9	3	"On the fourteenth day of this month, at twilight, you shall observe it at its appointed time; you shall observe it according to all its statutes and according to all its ordinances."
Numbers	Num	4	9	4	So Moses told the sons of Israel to observe the Passover.
Numbers	Num	4	9	5	They observed the Passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at twilight, in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that the LORD had commanded Moses, so the sons of Israel did.
Numbers	Num	4	9	6	But there were some men who were unclean because of the dead person, so that they could not observe Passover on that day; so they came before Moses and Aaron on that day.
Numbers	Num	4	9	7	Those men said to him, "Though we are unclean because of the dead person, why are we restrained from presenting the offering of the LORD at its appointed time among the sons of Israel?"
Numbers	Num	4	9	8	Moses therefore said to them, "Wait, and I will listen to what the LORD will command concerning you."
Numbers	Num	4	9	9	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	9	10	"Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'If any one of you or of your generations becomes unclean because of a dead person, or is on a distant journey, he may, however, observe the Passover to the LORD.
Numbers	Num	4	9	11	'In the second month on the fourteenth day at twilight, they shall observe it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
Numbers	Num	4	9	12	'They shall leave none of it until morning, nor break a bone of it; according to all the statute of the Passover they shall observe it.
Numbers	Num	4	9	13	'But the man who is clean and is not on a journey, and yet neglects to observe the Passover, that person shall then be cut off from his people, for he did not present the offering of the LORD at its appointed time. That man will bear his sin.
Numbers	Num	4	9	14	'If an alien sojourns among you and observes the Passover to the LORD, according to the statute of the Passover and according to its ordinance, so he shall do; you shall have one statute, both for the alien and for the native of the land.'"
Numbers	Num	4	9	15	Now on the day that the tabernacle was erected the cloud covered the tabernacle, the tent of the testimony, and in the evening it was like the appearance of fire over the tabernacle, until morning.
Numbers	Num	4	9	16	So it was continuously; the cloud would cover it by day, and the appearance of fire by night.
Numbers	Num	4	9	17	Whenever the cloud was lifted from over the tent, afterward the sons of Israel would then set out; and in the place where the cloud settled down, there the sons of Israel would camp.
Numbers	Num	4	9	18	At the command of the LORD the sons of Israel would set out, and at the command of the LORD they would camp; as long as the cloud settled over the tabernacle, they remained camped.
Numbers	Num	4	9	19	Even when the cloud lingered over the tabernacle for many days, the sons of Israel would keep the LORD'S charge and not set out.
Numbers	Num	4	9	20	If sometimes the cloud remained a few days over the tabernacle, according to the command of the LORD they remained camped. Then according to the command of the LORD they set out.
Numbers	Num	4	9	21	If sometimes the cloud remained from evening until morning, when the cloud was lifted in the morning, they would move out; or if it remained in the daytime and at night, whenever the cloud was lifted, they would set out.
Numbers	Num	4	9	22	Whether it was two days or a month or a year that the cloud lingered over the tabernacle, staying above it, the sons of Israel remained camped and did not set out; but when it was lifted, they did set out.
Numbers	Num	4	9	23	At the command of the LORD they camped, and at the command of the LORD they set out; they kept the LORD'S charge, according to the command of the LORD through Moses.
Numbers	Num	4	10	1	The LORD spoke further to Moses, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	10	2	"Make yourself two trumpets of silver, of hammered work you shall make them; and you shall use them for summoning the congregation and for having the camps set out.
Numbers	Num	4	10	3	"When both are blown, all the congregation shall gather themselves to you at the doorway of the tent of meeting.
Numbers	Num	4	10	4	"Yet if only one is blown, then the leaders, the heads of the divisions of Israel, shall assemble before you.
Numbers	Num	4	10	5	"But when you blow an alarm, the camps that are pitched on the east side shall set out.
Numbers	Num	4	10	6	"When you blow an alarm the second time, the camps that are pitched on the south side shall set out; an alarm is to be blown for them to set out.
Numbers	Num	4	10	7	"When convening the assembly, however, you shall blow without sounding an alarm.
Numbers	Num	4	10	8	"The priestly sons of Aaron, moreover, shall blow the trumpets; and this shall be for you a perpetual statute throughout your generations.
Numbers	Num	4	10	9	"When you go to war in your land against the adversary who attacks you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets, that you may be remembered before the LORD your God, and be saved from your enemies.
Numbers	Num	4	10	10	"Also in the day of your gladness and in your appointed feasts, and on the first days of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; and they shall be as a reminder of you before your God. I am the LORD your God."
Numbers	Num	4	10	11	Now in the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth of the month, the cloud was lifted from over the tabernacle of the testimony;
Numbers	Num	4	10	12	and the sons of Israel set out on their journeys from the wilderness of Sinai. Then the cloud settled down in the wilderness of Paran.
Numbers	Num	4	10	13	So they moved out for the first time according to the commandment of the LORD through Moses.
Numbers	Num	4	10	14	The standard of the camp of the sons of Judah, according to their armies, set out first, with Nahshon the son of Amminadab, over its army,
Numbers	Num	4	10	15	and Nethanel the son of Zuar, over the tribal army of the sons of Issachar;
Numbers	Num	4	10	16	and Eliab the son of Helon over the tribal army of the sons of Zebulun.
Numbers	Num	4	10	17	Then the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who were carrying the tabernacle, set out.
Numbers	Num	4	10	18	Next the standard of the camp of Reuben, according to their armies, set out with Elizur the son of Shedeur, over its army,
Numbers	Num	4	10	19	and Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai over the tribal army of the sons of Simeon,
Numbers	Num	4	10	20	and Eliasaph the son of Deuel was over the tribal army of the sons of Gad.
Numbers	Num	4	10	21	Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the holy objects; and the tabernacle was set up before their arrival.
Numbers	Num	4	10	22	Next the standard of the camp of the sons of Ephraim, according to their armies, was set out, with Elishama the son of Ammihud over its army,
Numbers	Num	4	10	23	and Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur over the tribal army of the sons of Manasseh;
Numbers	Num	4	10	24	and Abidan the son of Gideoni over the tribal army of the sons of Benjamin.
Numbers	Num	4	10	25	Then the standard of the camp of the sons of Dan, according to their armies, which formed the rear guard for all the camps, set out, with Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai over its army,
Numbers	Num	4	10	26	and Pagiel the son of Ochran over the tribal army of the sons of Asher;
Numbers	Num	4	10	27	and Ahira the son of Enan over the tribal army of the sons of Naphtali.
Numbers	Num	4	10	28	This was the order of march of the sons of Israel by their armies as they set out.
Numbers	Num	4	10	29	Then Moses said to Hobab the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law, "We are setting out to the place of which the LORD said, 'I will give it to you'; come with us and we will do you good, for the LORD has promised good concerning Israel."
Numbers	Num	4	10	30	But he said to him, "I will not come, but rather will go to my own land and relatives."
Numbers	Num	4	10	31	Then he said, "Please do not leave us, inasmuch as you know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you will be as eyes for us.
Numbers	Num	4	10	32	"So it will be, if you go with us, that whatever good the LORD does for us, we will do for you."
Numbers	Num	4	10	33	Thus they set out from the mount of the LORD three days' journey, with the ark of the covenant of the LORD journeying in front of them for the three days, to seek out a resting place for them.
Numbers	Num	4	10	34	The cloud of the LORD was over them by day when they set out from the camp.
Numbers	Num	4	10	35	Then it came about when the ark set out that Moses said, "Rise up, O LORD! And let Your enemies be scattered, And let those who hate You flee before You."
Numbers	Num	4	10	36	When it came to rest, he said, "Return, O LORD, To the myriad thousands of Israel."
Numbers	Num	4	11	1	Now the people became like those who complain of adversity in the hearing of the LORD; and when the LORD heard it, His anger was kindled, and the fire of the LORD burned among them and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp.
Numbers	Num	4	11	2	The people therefore cried out to Moses, and Moses prayed to the LORD and the fire died out.
Numbers	Num	4	11	3	So the name of that place was called Taberah, because the fire of the LORD burned among them.
Numbers	Num	4	11	4	The rabble who were among them had greedy desires; and also the sons of Israel wept again and said, "Who will give us meat to eat?
Numbers	Num	4	11	5	"We remember the fish which we used to eat free in Egypt, the cucumbers and the melons and the leeks and the onions and the garlic,
Numbers	Num	4	11	6	but now our appetite is gone. There is nothing at all to look at except this manna."
Numbers	Num	4	11	7	Now the manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like that of bdellium.
Numbers	Num	4	11	8	The people would go about and gather it and grind it between two millstones or beat it in the mortar, and boil it in the pot and make cakes with it; and its taste was as the taste of cakes baked with oil.
Numbers	Num	4	11	9	When the dew fell on the camp at night, the manna would fall with it.
Numbers	Num	4	11	10	Now Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, each man at the doorway of his tent; and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly, and Moses was displeased.
Numbers	Num	4	11	11	So Moses said to the LORD, "Why have You been so hard on Your servant? And why have I not found favor in Your sight, that You have laid the burden of all this people on me?
Numbers	Num	4	11	12	"Was it I who conceived all this people? Was it I who brought them forth, that You should say to me, 'Carry them in your bosom as a nurse carries a nursing infant, to the land which You swore to their fathers'?
Numbers	Num	4	11	13	"Where am I to get meat to give to all this people? For they weep before me, saying, 'Give us meat that we may eat!'
Numbers	Num	4	11	14	"I alone am not able to carry all this people, because it is too burdensome for me.
Numbers	Num	4	11	15	"So if You are going to deal thus with me, please kill me at once, if I have found favor in Your sight, and do not let me see my wretchedness."
Numbers	Num	4	11	16	The LORD therefore said to Moses, "Gather for Me seventy men from the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people and their officers and bring them to the tent of meeting, and let them take their stand there with you.
Numbers	Num	4	11	17	"Then I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take of the Spirit who is upon you, and will put Him upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, so that you will not bear it all alone.
Numbers	Num	4	11	18	"Say to the people, 'Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat; for you have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, "Oh that someone would give us meat to eat! For we were well-off in Egypt." Therefore the LORD will give you meat and you shall eat.
Numbers	Num	4	11	19	'You shall eat, not one day, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days,
Numbers	Num	4	11	20	but a whole month, until it comes out of your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you; because you have rejected the LORD who is among you and have wept before Him, saying, "Why did we ever leave Egypt?"'"
Numbers	Num	4	11	21	But Moses said, "The people, among whom I am, are 600,on foot; yet You have said, 'I will give them meat, so that they may eat for a whole month.'
Numbers	Num	4	11	22	"Should flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, to be sufficient for them? Or should all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to be sufficient for them?"
Numbers	Num	4	11	23	The LORD said to Moses, "Is the LORD'S power limited? Now you shall see whether My word will come true for you or not."
Numbers	Num	4	11	24	So Moses went out and told the people the words of the LORD. Also, he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and stationed them around the tent.
Numbers	Num	4	11	25	Then the LORD came down in the cloud and spoke to him; and He took of the Spirit who was upon him and placed Him upon the seventy elders. And when the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied. But they did not do it again.
Numbers	Num	4	11	26	But two men had remained in the camp; the name of one was Eldad and the name of the other Medad. And the Spirit rested upon them (now they were among those who had been registered, but had not gone out to the tent), and they prophesied in the camp.
Numbers	Num	4	11	27	So a young man ran and told Moses and said, "Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp."
Numbers	Num	4	11	28	Then Joshua the son of Nun, the attendant of Moses from his youth, said, "Moses, my lord, restrain them."
Numbers	Num	4	11	29	But Moses said to him, "Are you jealous for my sake? Would that all the LORD'S people were prophets, that the LORD would put His Spirit upon them!"
Numbers	Num	4	11	30	Then Moses returned to the camp, both he and the elders of Israel.
Numbers	Num	4	11	31	Now there went forth a wind from the LORD and it brought quail from the sea, and let them fall beside the camp, about a day's journey on this side and a day's journey on the other side, all around the camp and about two cubits deep on the surface of the ground.
Numbers	Num	4	11	32	The people spent all day and all night and all the next day, and gathered the quail (he who gathered least gathered ten homers) and they spread them out for themselves all around the camp.
Numbers	Num	4	11	33	While the meat was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, the anger of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD struck the people with a very severe plague.
Numbers	Num	4	11	34	So the name of that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had been greedy.
Numbers	Num	4	11	35	From Kibroth-hattaavah the people set out for Hazeroth, and they remained at Hazeroth.
Numbers	Num	4	12	1	Then Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married (for he had married a Cushite woman);
Numbers	Num	4	12	2	and they said, "Has the LORD indeed spoken only through Moses? Has He not spoken through us as well?" And the LORD heard it.
Numbers	Num	4	12	3	(Now the man Moses was very humble, more than any man who was on the face of the earth.)
Numbers	Num	4	12	4	Suddenly the LORD said to Moses and Aaron and to Miriam, "You three come out to the tent of meeting." So the three of them came out.
Numbers	Num	4	12	5	Then the LORD came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the doorway of the tent, and He called Aaron and Miriam. When they had both come forward,
Numbers	Num	4	12	6	He said, "Hear now My words: If there is a prophet among you, I, the LORD, shall make Myself known to him in a vision. I shall speak with him in a dream.
Numbers	Num	4	12	7	"Not so, with My servant Moses, He is faithful in all My household;
Numbers	Num	4	12	8	With him I speak mouth to mouth, Even openly, and not in dark sayings, And he beholds the form of the LORD. Why then were you not afraid To speak against My servant, against Moses?"
Numbers	Num	4	12	9	So the anger of the LORD burned against them and He departed.
Numbers	Num	4	12	10	But when the cloud had withdrawn from over the tent, behold, Miriam was leprous, as white as snow. As Aaron turned toward Miriam, behold, she was leprous.
Numbers	Num	4	12	11	Then Aaron said to Moses, "Oh, my lord, I beg you, do not account this sin to us, in which we have acted foolishly and in which we have sinned.
Numbers	Num	4	12	12	"Oh, do not let her be like one dead, whose flesh is half eaten away when he comes from his mother's womb!"
Numbers	Num	4	12	13	Moses cried out to the LORD, saying, "O God, heal her, I pray!"
Numbers	Num	4	12	14	But the LORD said to Moses, "If her father had but spit in her face, would she not bear her shame for seven days? Let her be shut up for seven days outside the camp, and afterward she may be received again."
Numbers	Num	4	12	15	So Miriam was shut up outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not move on until Miriam was received again.
Numbers	Num	4	12	16	Afterward, however, the people moved out from Hazeroth and camped in the wilderness of Paran.
Numbers	Num	4	13	1	Then the LORD spoke to Moses saying,
Numbers	Num	4	13	2	"Send out for yourself men so that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I am going to give to the sons of Israel; you shall send a man from each of their fathers' tribes, every one a leader among them."
Numbers	Num	4	13	3	So Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran at the command of the LORD, all of them men who were heads of the sons of Israel.
Numbers	Num	4	13	4	These then were their names: from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur;
Numbers	Num	4	13	5	from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori;
Numbers	Num	4	13	6	from the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh;
Numbers	Num	4	13	7	from the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph;
Numbers	Num	4	13	8	from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun;
Numbers	Num	4	13	9	from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu;
Numbers	Num	4	13	10	from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi;
Numbers	Num	4	13	11	from the tribe of Joseph, from the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi;
Numbers	Num	4	13	12	from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli;
Numbers	Num	4	13	13	from the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael;
Numbers	Num	4	13	14	from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi;
Numbers	Num	4	13	15	from the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.
Numbers	Num	4	13	16	These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land; but Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun, Joshua.
Numbers	Num	4	13	17	When Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, he said to them, "Go up there into the Negev; then go up into the hill country.
Numbers	Num	4	13	18	"See what the land is like, and whether the people who live in it are strong or weak, whether they are few or many.
Numbers	Num	4	13	19	"How is the land in which they live, is it good or bad? And how are the cities in which they live, are they like open camps or with fortifications?
Numbers	Num	4	13	20	"How is the land, is it fat or lean? Are there trees in it or not? Make an effort then to get some of the fruit of the land." Now the time was the time of the first ripe grapes.
Numbers	Num	4	13	21	So they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin as far as Rehob, at Lebo-hamath.
Numbers	Num	4	13	22	When they had gone up into the Negev, they came to Hebron where Ahiman, Sheshai and Talmai, the descendants of Anak were. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
Numbers	Num	4	13	23	Then they came to the valley of Eshcol and from there cut down a branch with a single cluster of grapes; and they carried it on a pole between two men, with some of the pomegranates and the figs.
Numbers	Num	4	13	24	That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the sons of Israel cut down from there.
Numbers	Num	4	13	25	When they returned from spying out the land, at the end of forty days,
Numbers	Num	4	13	26	they proceeded to come to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation of the sons of Israel in the wilderness of Paran, at Kadesh; and they brought back word to them and to all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land.
Numbers	Num	4	13	27	Thus they told him, and said, "We went in to the land where you sent us; and it certainly does flow with milk and honey, and this is its fruit.
Numbers	Num	4	13	28	"Nevertheless, the people who live in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large; and moreover, we saw the descendants of Anak there.
Numbers	Num	4	13	29	"Amalek is living in the land of the Negev and the Hittites and the Jebusites and the Amorites are living in the hill country, and the Canaanites are living by the sea and by the side of the Jordan."
Numbers	Num	4	13	30	Then Caleb quieted the people before Moses and said, "We should by all means go up and take possession of it, for we will surely overcome it."
Numbers	Num	4	13	31	But the men who had gone up with him said, "We are not able to go up against the people, for they are too strong for us."
Numbers	Num	4	13	32	So they gave out to the sons of Israel a bad report of the land which they had spied out, saying, "The land through which we have gone, in spying it out, is a land that devours its inhabitants; and all the people whom we saw in it are men of great size.
Numbers	Num	4	13	33	"There also we saw the Nephilim (the sons of Anak are part of the Nephilim); and we became like grasshoppers in our own sight, and so we were in their sight."
Numbers	Num	4	14	1	Then all the congregation lifted up their voices and cried, and the people wept that night.
Numbers	Num	4	14	2	All the sons of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron; and the whole congregation said to them, "Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! Or would that we had died in this wilderness!
Numbers	Num	4	14	3	"Why is the LORD bringing us into this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will become plunder; would it not be better for us to return to Egypt?"
Numbers	Num	4	14	4	So they said to one another, "Let us appoint a leader and return to Egypt."
Numbers	Num	4	14	5	Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces in the presence of all the assembly of the congregation of the sons of Israel.
Numbers	Num	4	14	6	Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, of those who had spied out the land, tore their clothes;
Numbers	Num	4	14	7	and they spoke to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, saying, "The land which we passed through to spy out is an exceedingly good land.
Numbers	Num	4	14	8	"If the LORD is pleased with us, then He will bring us into this land and give it to us--a land which flows with milk and honey.
Numbers	Num	4	14	9	"Only do not rebel against the LORD; and do not fear the people of the land, for they will be our prey. Their protection has been removed from them, and the LORD is with us; do not fear them."
Numbers	Num	4	14	10	But all the congregation said to stone them with stones. Then the glory of the LORD appeared in the tent of meeting to all the sons of Israel.
Numbers	Num	4	14	11	The LORD said to Moses, "How long will this people spurn Me? And how long will they not believe in Me, despite all the signs which I have performed in their midst?
Numbers	Num	4	14	12	"I will smite them with pestilence and dispossess them, and I will make you into a nation greater and mightier than they."
Numbers	Num	4	14	13	But Moses said to the LORD, "Then the Egyptians will hear of it, for by Your strength You brought up this people from their midst,
Numbers	Num	4	14	14	and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that You, O LORD, are in the midst of this people, for You, O LORD, are seen eye to eye, while Your cloud stands over them; and You go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night.
Numbers	Num	4	14	15	"Now if You slay this people as one man, then the nations who have heard of Your fame will say,
Numbers	Num	4	14	16	'Because the LORD could not bring this people into the land which He promised them by oath, therefore He slaughtered them in the wilderness.'
Numbers	Num	4	14	17	"But now, I pray, let the power of the Lord be great, just as You have declared,
Numbers	Num	4	14	18	'The LORD is slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness, forgiving iniquity and transgression; but He will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generations.'
Numbers	Num	4	14	19	"Pardon, I pray, the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of Your lovingkindness, just as You also have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now."
Numbers	Num	4	14	20	So the LORD said, "I have pardoned them according to your word;
Numbers	Num	4	14	21	but indeed, as I live, all the earth will be filled with the glory of the LORD.
Numbers	Num	4	14	22	"Surely all the men who have seen My glory and My signs which I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have put Me to the test these ten times and have not listened to My voice,
Numbers	Num	4	14	23	shall by no means see the land which I swore to their fathers, nor shall any of those who spurned Me see it.
Numbers	Num	4	14	24	"But My servant Caleb, because he has had a different spirit and has followed Me fully, I will bring into the land which he entered, and his descendants shall take possession of it.
Numbers	Num	4	14	25	"Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites live in the valleys; turn tomorrow and set out to the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea."
Numbers	Num	4	14	26	The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	14	27	"How long shall I bear with this evil congregation who are grumbling against Me? I have heard the complaints of the sons of Israel, which they are making against Me.
Numbers	Num	4	14	28	"Say to them, 'As I live,' says the LORD, 'just as you have spoken in My hearing, so I will surely do to you;
Numbers	Num	4	14	29	your corpses will fall in this wilderness, even all your numbered men, according to your complete number from twenty years old and upward, who have grumbled against Me.
Numbers	Num	4	14	30	'Surely you shall not come into the land in which I swore to settle you, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun.
Numbers	Num	4	14	31	'Your children, however, whom you said would become a prey--I will bring them in, and they will know the land which you have rejected.
Numbers	Num	4	14	32	'But as for you, your corpses will fall in this wilderness.
Numbers	Num	4	14	33	'Your sons shall be shepherds for forty years in the wilderness, and they will suffer for your unfaithfulness, until your corpses lie in the wilderness.
Numbers	Num	4	14	34	'According to the number of days which you spied out the land, forty days, for every day you shall bear your guilt a year, even forty years, and you will know My opposition.
Numbers	Num	4	14	35	'I, the LORD, have spoken, surely this I will do to all this evil congregation who are gathered together against Me. In this wilderness they shall be destroyed, and there they will die.'"
Numbers	Num	4	14	36	As for the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land and who returned and made all the congregation grumble against him by bringing out a bad report concerning the land,
Numbers	Num	4	14	37	even those men who brought out the very bad report of the land died by a plague before the LORD.
Numbers	Num	4	14	38	But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh remained alive out of those men who went to spy out the land.
Numbers	Num	4	14	39	When Moses spoke these words to all the sons of Israel, the people mourned greatly.
Numbers	Num	4	14	40	In the morning, however, they rose up early and went up to the ridge of the hill country, saying, "Here we are; we have indeed sinned, but we will go up to the place which the LORD has promised."
Numbers	Num	4	14	41	But Moses said, "Why then are you transgressing the commandment of the LORD, when it will not succeed?
Numbers	Num	4	14	42	"Do not go up, or you will be struck down before your enemies, for the LORD is not among you.
Numbers	Num	4	14	43	"For the Amalekites and the Canaanites will be there in front of you, and you will fall by the sword, inasmuch as you have turned back from following the LORD. And the LORD will not be with you."
Numbers	Num	4	14	44	But they went up heedlessly to the ridge of the hill country; neither the ark of the covenant of the LORD nor Moses left the camp.
Numbers	Num	4	14	45	Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in that hill country came down, and struck them and beat them down as far as Hormah.
Numbers	Num	4	15	1	Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	15	2	"Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'When you enter the land where you are to live, which I am giving you,
Numbers	Num	4	15	3	then make an offering by fire to the LORD, a burnt offering or a sacrifice to fulfill a special vow, or as a freewill offering or in your appointed times, to make a soothing aroma to the LORD, from the herd or from the flock.
Numbers	Num	4	15	4	'The one who presents his offering shall present to the LORD a grain offering of one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with one-fourth of a hin of oil,
Numbers	Num	4	15	5	and you shall prepare wine for the drink offering, one-fourth of a hin, with the burnt offering or for the sacrifice, for each lamb.
Numbers	Num	4	15	6	'Or for a ram you shall prepare as a grain offering two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with one-third of a hin of oil;
Numbers	Num	4	15	7	and for the drink offering you shall offer one-third of a hin of wine as a soothing aroma to the LORD.
Numbers	Num	4	15	8	'When you prepare a bull as a burnt offering or a sacrifice, to fulfill a special vow, or for peace offerings to the LORD,
Numbers	Num	4	15	9	then you shall offer with the bull a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with one-half a hin of oil;
Numbers	Num	4	15	10	and you shall offer as the drink offering one-half a hin of wine as an offering by fire, as a soothing aroma to the LORD.
Numbers	Num	4	15	11	'Thus it shall be done for each ox, or for each ram, or for each of the male lambs, or of the goats.
Numbers	Num	4	15	12	'According to the number that you prepare, so you shall do for everyone according to their number.
Numbers	Num	4	15	13	'All who are native shall do these things in this manner, in presenting an offering by fire, as a soothing aroma to the LORD.
Numbers	Num	4	15	14	'If an alien sojourns with you, or one who may be among you throughout your generations, and he wishes to make an offering by fire, as a soothing aroma to the LORD, just as you do so he shall do.
Numbers	Num	4	15	15	'As for the assembly, there shall be one statute for you and for the alien who sojourns with you, a perpetual statute throughout your generations; as you are, so shall the alien be before the LORD.
Numbers	Num	4	15	16	'There is to be one law and one ordinance for you and for the alien who sojourns with you.'"
Numbers	Num	4	15	17	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	15	18	"Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'When you enter the land where I bring you,
Numbers	Num	4	15	19	then it shall be, that when you eat of the food of the land, you shall lift up an offering to the LORD.
Numbers	Num	4	15	20	'Of the first of your dough you shall lift up a cake as an offering; as the offering of the threshing floor, so you shall lift it up.
Numbers	Num	4	15	21	'From the first of your dough you shall give to the LORD an offering throughout your generations.
Numbers	Num	4	15	22	'But when you unwittingly fail and do not observe all these commandments, which the LORD has spoken to Moses,
Numbers	Num	4	15	23	even all that the LORD has commanded you through Moses, from the day when the LORD gave commandment and onward throughout your generations,
Numbers	Num	4	15	24	then it shall be, if it is done unintentionally, without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one bull for a burnt offering, as a soothing aroma to the LORD, with its grain offering and its drink offering, according to the ordinance, and one male goat for a sin offering.
Numbers	Num	4	15	25	'Then the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the sons of Israel, and they will be forgiven; for it was an error, and they have brought their offering, an offering by fire to the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their error.
Numbers	Num	4	15	26	'So all the congregation of the sons of Israel will be forgiven, with the alien who sojourns among them, for it happened to all the people through error.
Numbers	Num	4	15	27	'Also if one person sins unintentionally, then he shall offer a one year old female goat for a sin offering.
Numbers	Num	4	15	28	'The priest shall make atonement before the LORD for the person who goes astray when he sins unintentionally, making atonement for him that he may be forgiven.
Numbers	Num	4	15	29	'You shall have one law for him who does anything unintentionally, for him who is native among the sons of Israel and for the alien who sojourns among them.
Numbers	Num	4	15	30	'But the person who does anything defiantly, whether he is native or an alien, that one is blaspheming the LORD; and that person shall be cut off from among his people.
Numbers	Num	4	15	31	'Because he has despised the word of the LORD and has broken His commandment, that person shall be completely cut off; his guilt will be on him.'"
Numbers	Num	4	15	32	Now while the sons of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering wood on the sabbath day.
Numbers	Num	4	15	33	Those who found him gathering wood brought him to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation;
Numbers	Num	4	15	34	and they put him in custody because it had not been declared what should be done to him.
Numbers	Num	4	15	35	Then the LORD said to Moses, "The man shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall stone him with stones outside the camp."
Numbers	Num	4	15	36	So all the congregation brought him outside the camp and stoned him to death with stones, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Numbers	Num	4	15	37	The LORD also spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	15	38	"Speak to the sons of Israel, and tell them that they shall make for themselves tassels on the corners of their garments throughout their generations, and that they shall put on the tassel of each corner a cord of blue.
Numbers	Num	4	15	39	"It shall be a tassel for you to look at and remember all the commandments of the LORD, so as to do them and not follow after your own heart and your own eyes, after which you played the harlot,
Numbers	Num	4	15	40	so that you may remember to do all My commandments and be holy to your God.
Numbers	Num	4	15	41	"I am the LORD your God who brought you out from the land of Egypt to be your God; I am the LORD your God."
Numbers	Num	4	16	1	Now Korah the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took action,
Numbers	Num	4	16	2	and they rose up before Moses, together with some of the sons of Israel, two hundred and fifty leaders of the congregation, chosen in the assembly, men of renown.
Numbers	Num	4	16	3	They assembled together against Moses and Aaron, and said to them, "You have gone far enough, for all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is in their midst; so why do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of the LORD?"
Numbers	Num	4	16	4	When Moses heard this, he fell on his face;
Numbers	Num	4	16	5	and he spoke to Korah and all his company, saying, "Tomorrow morning the LORD will show who is His, and who is holy, and will bring him near to Himself; even the one whom He will choose, He will bring near to Himself.
Numbers	Num	4	16	6	"Do this: take censers for yourselves, Korah and all your company,
Numbers	Num	4	16	7	and put fire in them, and lay incense upon them in the presence of the LORD tomorrow; and the man whom the LORD chooses shall be the one who is holy. You have gone far enough, you sons of Levi!"
Numbers	Num	4	16	8	Then Moses said to Korah, "Hear now, you sons of Levi,
Numbers	Num	4	16	9	is it not enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the rest of the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to Himself, to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them;
Numbers	Num	4	16	10	and that He has brought you near, Korah, and all your brothers, sons of Levi, with you? And are you seeking for the priesthood also?
Numbers	Num	4	16	11	"Therefore you and all your company are gathered together against the LORD; but as for Aaron, who is he that you grumble against him?"
Numbers	Num	4	16	12	Then Moses sent a summons to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; but they said, "We will not come up.
Numbers	Num	4	16	13	"Is it not enough that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to have us die in the wilderness, but you would also lord it over us?
Numbers	Num	4	16	14	"Indeed, you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor have you given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Would you put out the eyes of these men? We will not come up!"
Numbers	Num	4	16	15	Then Moses became very angry and said to the LORD, "Do not regard their offering! I have not taken a single donkey from them, nor have I done harm to any of them."
Numbers	Num	4	16	16	Moses said to Korah, "You and all your company be present before the LORD tomorrow, both you and they along with Aaron.
Numbers	Num	4	16	17	"Each of you take his firepan and put incense on it, and each of you bring his censer before the LORD, two hundred and fifty firepans; also you and Aaron shall each bring his firepan."
Numbers	Num	4	16	18	So they each took his own censer and put fire on it, and laid incense on it; and they stood at the doorway of the tent of meeting, with Moses and Aaron.
Numbers	Num	4	16	19	Thus Korah assembled all the congregation against them at the doorway of the tent of meeting. And the glory of the LORD appeared to all the congregation.
Numbers	Num	4	16	20	Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	16	21	"Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them instantly."
Numbers	Num	4	16	22	But they fell on their faces and said, "O God, God of the spirits of all flesh, when one man sins, will You be angry with the entire congregation?"
Numbers	Num	4	16	23	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	16	24	"Speak to the congregation, saying, 'Get back from around the dwellings of Korah, Dathan and Abiram.'"
Numbers	Num	4	16	25	Then Moses arose and went to Dathan and Abiram, with the elders of Israel following him,
Numbers	Num	4	16	26	and he spoke to the congregation, saying, "Depart now from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing that belongs to them, or you will be swept away in all their sin."
Numbers	Num	4	16	27	So they got back from around the dwellings of Korah, Dathan and Abiram; and Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the doorway of their tents, along with their wives and their sons and their little ones.
Numbers	Num	4	16	28	Moses said, "By this you shall know that the LORD has sent me to do all these deeds; for this is not my doing.
Numbers	Num	4	16	29	"If these men die the death of all men or if they suffer the fate of all men, then the LORD has not sent me.
Numbers	Num	4	16	30	"But if the LORD brings about an entirely new thing and the ground opens its mouth and swallows them up with all that is theirs, and they descend alive into Sheol, then you will understand that these men have spurned the LORD."
Numbers	Num	4	16	31	As he finished speaking all these words, the ground that was under them split open;
Numbers	Num	4	16	32	and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, and their households, and all the men who belonged to Korah with their possessions.
Numbers	Num	4	16	33	So they and all that belonged to them went down alive to Sheol; and the earth closed over them, and they perished from the midst of the assembly.
Numbers	Num	4	16	34	All Israel who were around them fled at their outcry, for they said, "The earth may swallow us up!"
Numbers	Num	4	16	35	Fire also came forth from the LORD and consumed the two hundred and fifty men who were offering the incense.
Numbers	Num	4	16	36	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	16	37	"Say to Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, that he shall take up the censers out of the midst of the blaze, for they are holy; and you scatter the burning coals abroad.
Numbers	Num	4	16	38	"As for the censers of these men who have sinned at the cost of their lives, let them be made into hammered sheets for a plating of the altar, since they did present them before the LORD and they are holy; and they shall be for a sign to the sons of Israel."
Numbers	Num	4	16	39	So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers which the men who were burned had offered, and they hammered them out as a plating for the altar,
Numbers	Num	4	16	40	as a reminder to the sons of Israel that no layman who is not of the descendants of Aaron should come near to burn incense before the LORD; so that he will not become like Korah and his company--just as the LORD had spoken to him through Moses.
Numbers	Num	4	16	41	But on the next day all the congregation of the sons of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron, saying, "You are the ones who have caused the death of the LORD'S people."
Numbers	Num	4	16	42	It came about, however, when the congregation had assembled against Moses and Aaron, that they turned toward the tent of meeting, and behold, the cloud covered it and the glory of the LORD appeared.
Numbers	Num	4	16	43	Then Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting,
Numbers	Num	4	16	44	and the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	16	45	"Get away from among this congregation, that I may consume them instantly." Then they fell on their faces.
Numbers	Num	4	16	46	Moses said to Aaron, "Take your censer and put in it fire from the altar, and lay incense on it; then bring it quickly to the congregation and make atonement for them, for wrath has gone forth from the LORD, the plague has begun!"
Numbers	Num	4	16	47	Then Aaron took it as Moses had spoken, and ran into the midst of the assembly, for behold, the plague had begun among the people. So he put on the incense and made atonement for the people.
Numbers	Num	4	16	48	He took his stand between the dead and the living, so that the plague was checked.
Numbers	Num	4	16	49	But those who died by the plague were 14,700, besides those who died on account of Korah.
Numbers	Num	4	16	50	Then Aaron returned to Moses at the doorway of the tent of meeting, for the plague had been checked.
Numbers	Num	4	17	1	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	17	2	"Speak to the sons of Israel, and get from them a rod for each father's household: twelve rods, from all their leaders according to their fathers' households. You shall write each name on his rod,
Numbers	Num	4	17	3	and write Aaron's name on the rod of Levi; for there is one rod for the head of each of their fathers' households.
Numbers	Num	4	17	4	"You shall then deposit them in the tent of meeting in front of the testimony, where I meet with you.
Numbers	Num	4	17	5	"It will come about that the rod of the man whom I choose will sprout. Thus I will lessen from upon Myself the grumblings of the sons of Israel, who are grumbling against you."
Numbers	Num	4	17	6	Moses therefore spoke to the sons of Israel, and all their leaders gave him a rod apiece, for each leader according to their fathers' households, twelve rods, with the rod of Aaron among their rods.
Numbers	Num	4	17	7	So Moses deposited the rods before the LORD in the tent of the testimony.
Numbers	Num	4	17	8	Now on the next day Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi had sprouted and put forth buds and produced blossoms, and it bore ripe almonds.
Numbers	Num	4	17	9	Moses then brought out all the rods from the presence of the LORD to all the sons of Israel; and they looked, and each man took his rod.
Numbers	Num	4	17	10	But the LORD said to Moses, "Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony to be kept as a sign against the rebels, that you may put an end to their grumblings against Me, so that they will not die."
Numbers	Num	4	17	11	Thus Moses did; just as the LORD had commanded him, so he did.
Numbers	Num	4	17	12	Then the sons of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, "Behold, we perish, we are dying, we are all dying!
Numbers	Num	4	17	13	"Everyone who comes near, who comes near to the tabernacle of the LORD, must die. Are we to perish completely?"
Numbers	Num	4	18	1	So the LORD said to Aaron, "You and your sons and your father's household with you shall bear the guilt in connection with the sanctuary, and you and your sons with you shall bear the guilt in connection with your priesthood.
Numbers	Num	4	18	2	"But bring with you also your brothers, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, that they may be joined with you and serve you, while you and your sons with you are before the tent of the testimony.
Numbers	Num	4	18	3	"And they shall thus attend to your obligation and the obligation of all the tent, but they shall not come near to the furnishings of the sanctuary and the altar, or both they and you will die.
Numbers	Num	4	18	4	"They shall be joined with you and attend to the obligations of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the tent; but an outsider may not come near you.
Numbers	Num	4	18	5	"So you shall attend to the obligations of the sanctuary and the obligations of the altar, so that there will no longer be wrath on the sons of Israel.
Numbers	Num	4	18	6	"Behold, I Myself have taken your fellow Levites from among the sons of Israel; they are a gift to you, dedicated to the LORD, to perform the service for the tent of meeting.
Numbers	Num	4	18	7	"But you and your sons with you shall attend to your priesthood for everything concerning the altar and inside the veil, and you are to perform service. I am giving you the priesthood as a bestowed service, but the outsider who comes near shall be put to death."
Numbers	Num	4	18	8	Then the LORD spoke to Aaron, "Now behold, I Myself have given you charge of My offerings, even all the holy gifts of the sons of Israel I have given them to you as a portion and to your sons as a perpetual allotment.
Numbers	Num	4	18	9	"This shall be yours from the most holy gifts reserved from the fire; every offering of theirs, even every grain offering and every sin offering and every guilt offering, which they shall render to Me, shall be most holy for you and for your sons.
Numbers	Num	4	18	10	"As the most holy gifts you shall eat it; every male shall eat it. It shall be holy to you.
Numbers	Num	4	18	11	"This also is yours, the offering of their gift, even all the wave offerings of the sons of Israel; I have given them to you and to your sons and daughters with you as a perpetual allotment. Everyone of your household who is clean may eat it.
Numbers	Num	4	18	12	"All the best of the fresh oil and all the best of the fresh wine and of the grain, the first fruits of those which they give to the LORD, I give them to you.
Numbers	Num	4	18	13	"The first ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring to the LORD, shall be yours; everyone of your household who is clean may eat it.
Numbers	Num	4	18	14	"Every devoted thing in Israel shall be yours.
Numbers	Num	4	18	15	"Every first issue of the womb of all flesh, whether man or animal, which they offer to the LORD, shall be yours; nevertheless the firstborn of man you shall surely redeem, and the firstborn of unclean animals you shall redeem.
Numbers	Num	4	18	16	"As to their redemption price, from a month old you shall redeem them, by your valuation, five shekels in silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.
Numbers	Num	4	18	17	"But the firstborn of an ox or the firstborn of a sheep or the firstborn of a goat, you shall not redeem; they are holy. You shall sprinkle their blood on the altar and shall offer up their fat in smoke as an offering by fire, for a soothing aroma to the LORD.
Numbers	Num	4	18	18	"Their meat shall be yours; it shall be yours like the breast of a wave offering and like the right thigh.
Numbers	Num	4	18	19	"All the offerings of the holy gifts, which the sons of Israel offer to the LORD, I have given to you and your sons and your daughters with you, as a perpetual allotment. It is an everlasting covenant of salt before the LORD to you and your descendants with you."
Numbers	Num	4	18	20	Then the LORD said to Aaron, "You shall have no inheritance in their land nor own any portion among them; I am your portion and your inheritance among the sons of Israel.
Numbers	Num	4	18	21	"To the sons of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they perform, the service of the tent of meeting.
Numbers	Num	4	18	22	"The sons of Israel shall not come near the tent of meeting again, or they will bear sin and die.
Numbers	Num	4	18	23	"Only the Levites shall perform the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity; it shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations, and among the sons of Israel they shall have no inheritance.
Numbers	Num	4	18	24	"For the tithe of the sons of Israel, which they offer as an offering to the LORD, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance; therefore I have said concerning them, 'They shall have no inheritance among the sons of Israel.'"
Numbers	Num	4	18	25	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	18	26	"Moreover, you shall speak to the Levites and say to them, 'When you take from the sons of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then you shall present an offering from it to the LORD, a tithe of the tithe.
Numbers	Num	4	18	27	'Your offering shall be reckoned to you as the grain from the threshing floor or the full produce from the wine vat.
Numbers	Num	4	18	28	'So you shall also present an offering to the LORD from your tithes, which you receive from the sons of Israel; and from it you shall give the LORD'S offering to Aaron the priest.
Numbers	Num	4	18	29	'Out of all your gifts you shall present every offering due to the LORD, from all the best of them, the sacred part from them.'
Numbers	Num	4	18	30	"You shall say to them, 'When you have offered from it the best of it, then the rest shall be reckoned to the Levites as the product of the threshing floor, and as the product of the wine vat.
Numbers	Num	4	18	31	'You may eat it anywhere, you and your households, for it is your compensation in return for your service in the tent of meeting.
Numbers	Num	4	18	32	'You will bear no sin by reason of it when you have offered the best of it. But you shall not profane the sacred gifts of the sons of Israel, or you will die.'"
Numbers	Num	4	19	1	Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	19	2	"This is the statute of the law which the LORD has commanded, saying, 'Speak to the sons of Israel that they bring you an unblemished red heifer in which is no defect and on which a yoke has never been placed.
Numbers	Num	4	19	3	'You shall give it to Eleazar the priest, and it shall be brought outside the camp and be slaughtered in his presence.
Numbers	Num	4	19	4	'Next Eleazar the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger and sprinkle some of its blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven times.
Numbers	Num	4	19	5	'Then the heifer shall be burned in his sight; its hide and its flesh and its blood, with its refuse, shall be burned.
Numbers	Num	4	19	6	'The priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet material and cast it into the midst of the burning heifer.
Numbers	Num	4	19	7	'The priest shall then wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterward come into the camp, but the priest shall be unclean until evening.
Numbers	Num	4	19	8	'The one who burns it shall also wash his clothes in water and bathe his body in water, and shall be unclean until evening.
Numbers	Num	4	19	9	'Now a man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and deposit them outside the camp in a clean place, and the congregation of the sons of Israel shall keep it as water to remove impurity; it is purification from sin.
Numbers	Num	4	19	10	'The one who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening; and it shall be a perpetual statute to the sons of Israel and to the alien who sojourns among them.
Numbers	Num	4	19	11	'The one who touches the corpse of any person shall be unclean for seven days.
Numbers	Num	4	19	12	'That one shall purify himself from uncleanness with the water on the third day and on the seventh day, and then he will be clean; but if he does not purify himself on the third day and on the seventh day, he will not be clean.
Numbers	Num	4	19	13	'Anyone who touches a corpse, the body of a man who has died, and does not purify himself, defiles the tabernacle of the LORD; and that person shall be cut off from Israel. Because the water for impurity was not sprinkled on him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is still on him.
Numbers	Num	4	19	14	'This is the law when a man dies in a tent: everyone who comes into the tent and everyone who is in the tent shall be unclean for seven days.
Numbers	Num	4	19	15	'Every open vessel, which has no covering tied down on it, shall be unclean.
Numbers	Num	4	19	16	'Also, anyone who in the open field touches one who has been slain with a sword or who has died naturally, or a human bone or a grave, shall be unclean for seven days.
Numbers	Num	4	19	17	'Then for the unclean person they shall take some of the ashes of the burnt purification from sin and flowing water shall be added to them in a vessel.
Numbers	Num	4	19	18	'A clean person shall take hyssop and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it on the tent and on all the furnishings and on the persons who were there, and on the one who touched the bone or the one slain or the one dying naturally or the grave.
Numbers	Num	4	19	19	'Then the clean person shall sprinkle on the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day; and on the seventh day he shall purify him from uncleanness, and he shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and shall be clean by evening.
Numbers	Num	4	19	20	'But the man who is unclean and does not purify himself from uncleanness, that person shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly, because he has defiled the sanctuary of the LORD; the water for impurity has not been sprinkled on him, he is unclean.
Numbers	Num	4	19	21	'So it shall be a perpetual statute for them. And he who sprinkles the water for impurity shall wash his clothes, and he who touches the water for impurity shall be unclean until evening.
Numbers	Num	4	19	22	'Furthermore, anything that the unclean person touches shall be unclean; and the person who touches it shall be unclean until evening.'"
Numbers	Num	4	20	1	Then the sons of Israel, the whole congregation, came to the wilderness of Zin in the first month; and the people stayed at Kadesh. Now Miriam died there and was buried there.
Numbers	Num	4	20	2	There was no water for the congregation, and they assembled themselves against Moses and Aaron.
Numbers	Num	4	20	3	The people thus contended with Moses and spoke, saying, "If only we had perished when our brothers perished before the LORD!
Numbers	Num	4	20	4	"Why then have you brought the LORD'S assembly into this wilderness, for us and our beasts to die here?
Numbers	Num	4	20	5	"Why have you made us come up from Egypt, to bring us in to this wretched place? It is not a place of grain or figs or vines or pomegranates, nor is there water to drink."
Numbers	Num	4	20	6	Then Moses and Aaron came in from the presence of the assembly to the doorway of the tent of meeting and fell on their faces. Then the glory of the LORD appeared to them;
Numbers	Num	4	20	7	and the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	20	8	"Take the rod; and you and your brother Aaron assemble the congregation and speak to the rock before their eyes, that it may yield its water. You shall thus bring forth water for them out of the rock and let the congregation and their beasts drink."
Numbers	Num	4	20	9	So Moses took the rod from before the LORD, just as He had commanded him;
Numbers	Num	4	20	10	and Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly before the rock. And he said to them, "Listen now, you rebels; shall we bring forth water for you out of this rock?"
Numbers	Num	4	20	11	Then Moses lifted up his hand and struck the rock twice with his rod; and water came forth abundantly, and the congregation and their beasts drank.
Numbers	Num	4	20	12	But the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "Because you have not believed Me, to treat Me as holy in the sight of the sons of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them."
Numbers	Num	4	20	13	Those were the waters of Meribah, because the sons of Israel contended with the LORD, and He proved Himself holy among them.
Numbers	Num	4	20	14	From Kadesh Moses then sent messengers to the king of Edom: "Thus your brother Israel has said, 'You know all the hardship that has befallen us;
Numbers	Num	4	20	15	that our fathers went down to Egypt, and we stayed in Egypt a long time, and the Egyptians treated us and our fathers badly.
Numbers	Num	4	20	16	'But when we cried out to the LORD, He heard our voice and sent an angel and brought us out from Egypt; now behold, we are at Kadesh, a town on the edge of your territory.
Numbers	Num	4	20	17	'Please let us pass through your land. We will not pass through field or through vineyard; we will not even drink water from a well. We will go along the king's highway, not turning to the right or left, until we pass through your territory.'"
Numbers	Num	4	20	18	Edom, however, said to him, "You shall not pass through us, or I will come out with the sword against you."
Numbers	Num	4	20	19	Again, the sons of Israel said to him, "We will go up by the highway, and if I and my livestock do drink any of your water, then I will pay its price. Let me only pass through on my feet, nothing else."
Numbers	Num	4	20	20	But he said, "You shall not pass through." And Edom came out against him with a heavy force and with a strong hand.
Numbers	Num	4	20	21	Thus Edom refused to allow Israel to pass through his territory; so Israel turned away from him.
Numbers	Num	4	20	22	Now when they set out from Kadesh, the sons of Israel, the whole congregation, came to Mount Hor.
Numbers	Num	4	20	23	Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron at Mount Hor by the border of the land of Edom, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	20	24	"Aaron will be gathered to his people; for he shall not enter the land which I have given to the sons of Israel, because you rebelled against My command at the waters of Meribah.
Numbers	Num	4	20	25	"Take Aaron and his son Eleazar and bring them up to Mount Hor;
Numbers	Num	4	20	26	and strip Aaron of his garments and put them on his son Eleazar. So Aaron will be gathered to his people, and will die there."
Numbers	Num	4	20	27	So Moses did just as the LORD had commanded, and they went up to Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.
Numbers	Num	4	20	28	After Moses had stripped Aaron of his garments and put them on his son Eleazar, Aaron died there on the mountain top. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.
Numbers	Num	4	20	29	When all the congregation saw that Aaron had died, all the house of Israel wept for Aaron thirty days.
Numbers	Num	4	21	1	When the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming by the way of Atharim, then he fought against Israel and took some of them captive.
Numbers	Num	4	21	2	So Israel made a vow to the LORD and said, "If You will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities."
Numbers	Num	4	21	3	The LORD heard the voice of Israel and delivered up the Canaanites; then they utterly destroyed them and their cities. Thus the name of the place was called Hormah.
Numbers	Num	4	21	4	Then they set out from Mount Hor by the way of the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom; and the people became impatient because of the journey.
Numbers	Num	4	21	5	The people spoke against God and Moses, "Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and we loathe this miserable food."
Numbers	Num	4	21	6	The LORD sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people, so that many people of Israel died.
Numbers	Num	4	21	7	So the people came to Moses and said, "We have sinned, because we have spoken against the LORD and you; intercede with the LORD, that He may remove the serpents from us." And Moses interceded for the people.
Numbers	Num	4	21	8	Then the LORD said to Moses, "Make a fiery serpent, and set it on a standard; and it shall come about, that everyone who is bitten, when he looks at it, he will live."
Numbers	Num	4	21	9	And Moses made a bronze serpent and set it on the standard; and it came about, that if a serpent bit any man, when he looked to the bronze serpent, he lived.
Numbers	Num	4	21	10	Now the sons of Israel moved out and camped in Oboth.
Numbers	Num	4	21	11	They journeyed from Oboth and camped at Iyeabarim, in the wilderness which is opposite Moab, to the east.
Numbers	Num	4	21	12	From there they set out and camped in Wadi Zered.
Numbers	Num	4	21	13	From there they journeyed and camped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that comes out of the border of the Amorites, for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.
Numbers	Num	4	21	14	Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of the LORD, "Waheb in Suphah, And the wadis of the Arnon,
Numbers	Num	4	21	15	And the slope of the wadis That extends to the site of Ar, And leans to the border of Moab."
Numbers	Num	4	21	16	From there they continued to Beer, that is the well where the LORD said to Moses, "Assemble the people, that I may give them water."
Numbers	Num	4	21	17	Then Israel sang this song: "Spring up, O well! Sing to it!
Numbers	Num	4	21	18	"The well, which the leaders sank, Which the nobles of the people dug, With the scepter and with their staffs." And from the wilderness they continued to Mattanah,
Numbers	Num	4	21	19	and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth,
Numbers	Num	4	21	20	and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the land of Moab, at the top of Pisgah which overlooks the wasteland.
Numbers	Num	4	21	21	Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon, king of the Amorites, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	21	22	"Let me pass through your land. We will not turn off into field or vineyard; we will not drink water from wells. We will go by the king's highway until we have passed through your border."
Numbers	Num	4	21	23	But Sihon would not permit Israel to pass through his border. So Sihon gathered all his people and went out against Israel in the wilderness, and came to Jahaz and fought against Israel.
Numbers	Num	4	21	24	Then Israel struck him with the edge of the sword, and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as the sons of Ammon; for the border of the sons of Ammon was Jazer.
Numbers	Num	4	21	25	Israel took all these cities and Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all her villages.
Numbers	Num	4	21	26	For Heshbon was the city of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken all his land out of his hand, as far as the Arnon.
Numbers	Num	4	21	27	Therefore those who use proverbs say, "Come to Heshbon! Let it be built! So let the city of Sihon be established.
Numbers	Num	4	21	28	"For a fire went forth from Heshbon, A flame from the town of Sihon; It devoured Ar of Moab, The dominant heights of the Arnon.
Numbers	Num	4	21	29	"Woe to you, O Moab! You are ruined, O people of Chemosh! He has given his sons as fugitives, And his daughters into captivity, To an Amorite king, Sihon.
Numbers	Num	4	21	30	"But we have cast them down, Heshbon is ruined as far as Dibon, Then we have laid waste even to Nophah, Which reaches to Medeba."
Numbers	Num	4	21	31	Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites.
Numbers	Num	4	21	32	Moses sent to spy out Jazer, and they captured its villages and dispossessed the Amorites who were there.
Numbers	Num	4	21	33	Then they turned and went up by the way of Bashan, and Og the king of Bashan went out with all his people, for battle at Edrei.
Numbers	Num	4	21	34	But the LORD said to Moses, "Do not fear him, for I have given him into your hand, and all his people and his land; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon, king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon."
Numbers	Num	4	21	35	So they killed him and his sons and all his people, until there was no remnant left him; and they possessed his land.
Numbers	Num	4	22	1	Then the sons of Israel journeyed, and camped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan opposite Jericho.
Numbers	Num	4	22	2	Now Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
Numbers	Num	4	22	3	So Moab was in great fear because of the people, for they were numerous; and Moab was in dread of the sons of Israel.
Numbers	Num	4	22	4	Moab said to the elders of Midian, "Now this horde will lick up all that is around us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field." And Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.
Numbers	Num	4	22	5	So he sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, at Pethor, which is near the River, in the land of the sons of his people, to call him, saying, "Behold, a people came out of Egypt; behold, they cover the surface of the land, and they are living opposite me.
Numbers	Num	4	22	6	"Now, therefore, please come, curse this people for me since they are too mighty for me; perhaps I may be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land. For I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed."
Numbers	Num	4	22	7	So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the fees for divination in their hand; and they came to Balaam and repeated Balak's words to him.
Numbers	Num	4	22	8	He said to them, "Spend the night here, and I will bring word back to you as the LORD may speak to me." And the leaders of Moab stayed with Balaam.
Numbers	Num	4	22	9	Then God came to Balaam and said, "Who are these men with you?"
Numbers	Num	4	22	10	Balaam said to God, "Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent word to me,
Numbers	Num	4	22	11	'Behold, there is a people who came out of Egypt and they cover the surface of the land; now come, curse them for me; perhaps I may be able to fight against them and drive them out.'"
Numbers	Num	4	22	12	God said to Balaam, "Do not go with them; you shall not curse the people, for they are blessed."
Numbers	Num	4	22	13	So Balaam arose in the morning and said to Balak's leaders, "Go back to your land, for the LORD has refused to let me go with you."
Numbers	Num	4	22	14	The leaders of Moab arose and went to Balak and said, "Balaam refused to come with us."
Numbers	Num	4	22	15	Then Balak again sent leaders, more numerous and more distinguished than the former.
Numbers	Num	4	22	16	They came to Balaam and said to him, "Thus says Balak the son of Zippor, 'Let nothing, I beg you, hinder you from coming to me;
Numbers	Num	4	22	17	for I will indeed honor you richly, and I will do whatever you say to me. Please come then, curse this people for me.'"
Numbers	Num	4	22	18	Balaam replied to the servants of Balak, "Though Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not do anything, either small or great, contrary to the command of the LORD my God.
Numbers	Num	4	22	19	"Now please, you also stay here tonight, and I will find out what else the LORD will speak to me."
Numbers	Num	4	22	20	God came to Balaam at night and said to him, "If the men have come to call you, rise up and go with them; but only the word which I speak to you shall you do."
Numbers	Num	4	22	21	So Balaam arose in the morning, and saddled his donkey and went with the leaders of Moab.
Numbers	Num	4	22	22	But God was angry because he was going, and the angel of the LORD took his stand in the way as an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his donkey and his two servants were with him.
Numbers	Num	4	22	23	When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way with his drawn sword in his hand, the donkey turned off from the way and went into the field; but Balaam struck the donkey to turn her back into the way.
Numbers	Num	4	22	24	Then the angel of the LORD stood in a narrow path of the vineyards, with a wall on this side and a wall on that side.
Numbers	Num	4	22	25	When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she pressed herself to the wall and pressed Balaam's foot against the wall, so he struck her again.
Numbers	Num	4	22	26	The angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place where there was no way to turn to the right hand or the left.
Numbers	Num	4	22	27	When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she lay down under Balaam; so Balaam was angry and struck the donkey with his stick.
Numbers	Num	4	22	28	And the LORD opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, "What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?"
Numbers	Num	4	22	29	Then Balaam said to the donkey, "Because you have made a mockery of me! If there had been a sword in my hand, I would have killed you by now."
Numbers	Num	4	22	30	The donkey said to Balaam, "Am I not your donkey on which you have ridden all your life to this day? Have I ever been accustomed to do so to you?" And he said, "No."
Numbers	Num	4	22	31	Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way with his drawn sword in his hand; and he bowed all the way to the ground.
Numbers	Num	4	22	32	The angel of the LORD said to him, "Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out as an adversary, because your way was contrary to me.
Numbers	Num	4	22	33	"But the donkey saw me and turned aside from me these three times. If she had not turned aside from me, I would surely have killed you just now, and let her live."
Numbers	Num	4	22	34	Balaam said to the angel of the LORD, "I have sinned, for I did not know that you were standing in the way against me. Now then, if it is displeasing to you, I will turn back."
Numbers	Num	4	22	35	But the angel of the LORD said to Balaam, "Go with the men, but you shall speak only the word which I tell you." So Balaam went along with the leaders of Balak.
Numbers	Num	4	22	36	When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the city of Moab, which is on the Arnon border, at the extreme end of the border.
Numbers	Num	4	22	37	Then Balak said to Balaam, "Did I not urgently send to you to call you? Why did you not come to me? Am I really unable to honor you?"
Numbers	Num	4	22	38	So Balaam said to Balak, "Behold, I have come now to you! Am I able to speak anything at all? The word that God puts in my mouth, that I shall speak."
Numbers	Num	4	22	39	And Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath-huzoth.
Numbers	Num	4	22	40	Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent some to Balaam and the leaders who were with him.
Numbers	Num	4	22	41	Then it came about in the morning that Balak took Balaam and brought him up to the high places of Baal, and he saw from there a portion of the people.
Numbers	Num	4	23	1	Then Balaam said to Balak, "Build seven altars for me here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me here."
Numbers	Num	4	23	2	Balak did just as Balaam had spoken, and Balak and Balaam offered up a bull and a ram on each altar.
Numbers	Num	4	23	3	Then Balaam said to Balak, "Stand beside your burnt offering, and I will go; perhaps the LORD will come to meet me, and whatever He shows me I will tell you." So he went to a bare hill.
Numbers	Num	4	23	4	Now God met Balaam, and he said to Him, "I have set up the seven altars, and I have offered up a bull and a ram on each altar."
Numbers	Num	4	23	5	Then the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth and said, "Return to Balak, and you shall speak thus."
Numbers	Num	4	23	6	So he returned to him, and behold, he was standing beside his burnt offering, he and all the leaders of Moab.
Numbers	Num	4	23	7	He took up his discourse and said, "From Aram Balak has brought me, Moab's king from the mountains of the East, 'Come curse Jacob for me, And come, denounce Israel!'
Numbers	Num	4	23	8	"How shall I curse whom God has not cursed? And how can I denounce whom the LORD has not denounced?
Numbers	Num	4	23	9	"As I see him from the top of the rocks, And I look at him from the hills; Behold, a people who dwells apart, And will not be reckoned among the nations.
Numbers	Num	4	23	10	"Who can count the dust of Jacob, Or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the upright, And let my end be like his!"
Numbers	Num	4	23	11	Then Balak said to Balaam, "What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, but behold, you have actually blessed them!"
Numbers	Num	4	23	12	He replied, "Must I not be careful to speak what the LORD puts in my mouth?"
Numbers	Num	4	23	13	Then Balak said to him, "Please come with me to another place from where you may see them, although you will only see the extreme end of them and will not see all of them; and curse them for me from there."
Numbers	Num	4	23	14	So he took him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
Numbers	Num	4	23	15	And he said to Balak, "Stand here beside your burnt offering while I myself meet the LORD over there."
Numbers	Num	4	23	16	Then the LORD met Balaam and put a word in his mouth and said, "Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak."
Numbers	Num	4	23	17	He came to him, and behold, he was standing beside his burnt offering, and the leaders of Moab with him. And Balak said to him, "What has the LORD spoken?"
Numbers	Num	4	23	18	Then he took up his discourse and said, "Arise, O Balak, and hear; Give ear to me, O son of Zippor!
Numbers	Num	4	23	19	"God is not a man, that He should lie, Nor a son of man, that He should repent; Has He said, and will He not do it? Or has He spoken, and will He not make it good?
Numbers	Num	4	23	20	"Behold, I have received a command to bless; When He has blessed, then I cannot revoke it.
Numbers	Num	4	23	21	"He has not observed misfortune in Jacob; Nor has He seen trouble in Israel; The LORD his God is with him, And the shout of a king is among them.
Numbers	Num	4	23	22	"God brings them out of Egypt, He is for them like the horns of the wild ox.
Numbers	Num	4	23	23	"For there is no omen against Jacob, Nor is there any divination against Israel; At the proper time it shall be said to Jacob And to Israel, what God has done!
Numbers	Num	4	23	24	"Behold, a people rises like a lioness, And as a lion it lifts itself; It will not lie down until it devours the prey, And drinks the blood of the slain."
Numbers	Num	4	23	25	Then Balak said to Balaam, "Do not curse them at all nor bless them at all!"
Numbers	Num	4	23	26	But Balaam replied to Balak, "Did I not tell you, 'Whatever the LORD speaks, that I must do'?"
Numbers	Num	4	23	27	Then Balak said to Balaam, "Please come, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will be agreeable with God that you curse them for me from there."
Numbers	Num	4	23	28	So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor which overlooks the wasteland.
Numbers	Num	4	23	29	Balaam said to Balak, "Build seven altars for me here and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me here."
Numbers	Num	4	23	30	Balak did just as Balaam had said, and offered up a bull and a ram on each altar.
Numbers	Num	4	24	1	When Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he did not go as at other times to seek omens but he set his face toward the wilderness.
Numbers	Num	4	24	2	And Balaam lifted up his eyes and saw Israel camping tribe by tribe; and the Spirit of God came upon him.
Numbers	Num	4	24	3	He took up his discourse and said, "The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor, And the oracle of the man whose eye is opened;
Numbers	Num	4	24	4	The oracle of him who hears the words of God, Who sees the vision of the Almighty, Falling down, yet having his eyes uncovered,
Numbers	Num	4	24	5	How fair are your tents, O Jacob, Your dwellings, O Israel!
Numbers	Num	4	24	6	"Like valleys that stretch out, Like gardens beside the river, Like aloes planted by the LORD, Like cedars beside the waters.
Numbers	Num	4	24	7	"Water will flow from his buckets, And his seed will be by many waters, And his king shall be higher than Agag, And his kingdom shall be exalted.
Numbers	Num	4	24	8	"God brings him out of Egypt, He is for him like the horns of the wild ox. He will devour the nations who are his adversaries, And will crush their bones in pieces, And shatter them with his arrows.
Numbers	Num	4	24	9	"He couches, he lies down as a lion, And as a lion, who dares rouse him? Blessed is everyone who blesses you, And cursed is everyone who curses you."
Numbers	Num	4	24	10	Then Balak's anger burned against Balaam, and he struck his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, "I called you to curse my enemies, but behold, you have persisted in blessing them these three times!
Numbers	Num	4	24	11	"Therefore, flee to your place now. I said I would honor you greatly, but behold, the LORD has held you back from honor."
Numbers	Num	4	24	12	Balaam said to Balak, "Did I not tell your messengers whom you had sent to me, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	24	13	'Though Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not do anything contrary to the command of the LORD, either good or bad, of my own accord. What the LORD speaks, that I will speak'?
Numbers	Num	4	24	14	"And now, behold, I am going to my people; come, and I will advise you what this people will do to your people in the days to come."
Numbers	Num	4	24	15	He took up his discourse and said, "The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor, And the oracle of the man whose eye is opened,
Numbers	Num	4	24	16	The oracle of him who hears the words of God, And knows the knowledge of the Most High, Who sees the vision of the Almighty, Falling down, yet having his eyes uncovered.
Numbers	Num	4	24	17	"I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near; A star shall come forth from Jacob, A scepter shall rise from Israel, And shall crush through the forehead of Moab, And tear down all the sons of Sheth.
Numbers	Num	4	24	18	"Edom shall be a possession, Seir, its enemies, also will be a possession, While Israel performs valiantly.
Numbers	Num	4	24	19	"One from Jacob shall have dominion, And will destroy the remnant from the city."
Numbers	Num	4	24	20	And he looked at Amalek and took up his discourse and said, "Amalek was the first of the nations, But his end shall be destruction."
Numbers	Num	4	24	21	And he looked at the Kenite, and took up his discourse and said, "Your dwelling place is enduring, And your nest is set in the cliff.
Numbers	Num	4	24	22	"Nevertheless Kain will be consumed; How long will Asshur keep you captive?"
Numbers	Num	4	24	23	Then he took up his discourse and said, "Alas, who can live except God has ordained it?
Numbers	Num	4	24	24	"But ships shall come from the coast of Kittim, And they shall afflict Asshur and will afflict Eber; So they also will come to destruction."
Numbers	Num	4	24	25	Then Balaam arose and departed and returned to his place, and Balak also went his way.
Numbers	Num	4	25	1	While Israel remained at Shittim, the people began to play the harlot with the daughters of Moab.
Numbers	Num	4	25	2	For they invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate and bowed down to their gods.
Numbers	Num	4	25	3	So Israel joined themselves to Baal of Peor, and the LORD was angry against Israel.
Numbers	Num	4	25	4	The LORD said to Moses, "Take all the leaders of the people and execute them in broad daylight before the LORD, so that the fierce anger of the LORD may turn away from Israel."
Numbers	Num	4	25	5	So Moses said to the judges of Israel, "Each of you slay his men who have joined themselves to Baal of Peor."
Numbers	Num	4	25	6	Then behold, one of the sons of Israel came and brought to his relatives a Midianite woman, in the sight of Moses and in the sight of all the congregation of the sons of Israel, while they were weeping at the doorway of the tent of meeting.
Numbers	Num	4	25	7	When Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he arose from the midst of the congregation and took a spear in his hand,
Numbers	Num	4	25	8	and he went after the man of Israel into the tent and pierced both of them through, the man of Israel and the woman, through the body. So the plague on the sons of Israel was checked.
Numbers	Num	4	25	9	Those who died by the plague were 24,000.
Numbers	Num	4	25	10	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	25	11	"Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned away My wrath from the sons of Israel in that he was jealous with My jealousy among them, so that I did not destroy the sons of Israel in My jealousy.
Numbers	Num	4	25	12	"Therefore say, 'Behold, I give him My covenant of peace;
Numbers	Num	4	25	13	and it shall be for him and his descendants after him, a covenant of a perpetual priesthood, because he was jealous for his God and made atonement for the sons of Israel.'"
Numbers	Num	4	25	14	Now the name of the slain man of Israel who was slain with the Midianite woman, was Zimri the son of Salu, a leader of a father's household among the Simeonites.
Numbers	Num	4	25	15	The name of the Midianite woman who was slain was Cozbi the daughter of Zur, who was head of the people of a father's household in Midian.
Numbers	Num	4	25	16	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	25	17	"Be hostile to the Midianites and strike them;
Numbers	Num	4	25	18	for they have been hostile to you with their tricks, with which they have deceived you in the affair of Peor and in the affair of Cozbi, the daughter of the leader of Midian, their sister who was slain on the day of the plague because of Peor."
Numbers	Num	4	26	1	Then it came about after the plague, that the LORD spoke to Moses and to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	26	2	"Take a census of all the congregation of the sons of Israel from twenty years old and upward, by their fathers' households, whoever is able to go out to war in Israel."
Numbers	Num	4	26	3	So Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	26	4	"Take a census of the people from twenty years old and upward, as the LORD has commanded Moses." Now the sons of Israel who came out of the land of Egypt were:
Numbers	Num	4	26	5	Reuben, Israel's firstborn, the sons of Reuben: of Hanoch, the family of the Hanochites; of Pallu, the family of the Palluites;
Numbers	Num	4	26	6	of Hezron, the family of the Hezronites; of Carmi, the family of the Carmites.
Numbers	Num	4	26	7	These are the families of the Reubenites, and those who were numbered of them were 43,730.
Numbers	Num	4	26	8	The son of Pallu: Eliab.
Numbers	Num	4	26	9	The sons of Eliab: Nemuel and Dathan and Abiram. These are the Dathan and Abiram who were called by the congregation, who contended against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah, when they contended against the LORD,
Numbers	Num	4	26	10	and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up along with Korah, when that company died, when the fire devoured men, so that they became a warning.
Numbers	Num	4	26	11	The sons of Korah, however, did not die.
Numbers	Num	4	26	12	The sons of Simeon according to their families: of Nemuel, the family of the Nemuelites; of Jamin, the family of the Jaminites; of Jachin, the family of the Jachinites;

Numbers	Num	4	26	30	These are the sons of Gilead: of Iezer, the family of the Iezerites; of Helek, the family of the Helekites;

Numbers	Num	4	26	52	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	26	53	"Among these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according to the number of names.
Numbers	Num	4	26	54	"To the larger group you shall increase their inheritance, and to the smaller group you shall diminish their inheritance; each shall be given their inheritance according to those who were numbered of them.
Numbers	Num	4	26	55	"But the land shall be divided by lot. They shall receive their inheritance according to the names of the tribes of their fathers.
Numbers	Num	4	26	56	"According to the selection by lot, their inheritance shall be divided between the larger and the smaller groups."
Numbers	Num	4	26	57	These are those who were numbered of the Levites according to their families: of Gershon, the family of the Gershonites; of Kohath, the family of the Kohathites; of Merari, the family of the Merarites.

Numbers	Num	4	26	60	To Aaron were born Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
Numbers	Num	4	26	61	But Nadab and Abihu died when they offered strange fire before the LORD.
Numbers	Num	4	26	62	Those who were numbered of them were 23,000, every male from a month old and upward, for they were not numbered among the sons of Israel since no inheritance was given to them among the sons of Israel.
Numbers	Num	4	26	63	These are those who were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the sons of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
Numbers	Num	4	26	64	But among these there was not a man of those who were numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest, who numbered the sons of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.
Numbers	Num	4	26	65	For the LORD had said of them, "They shall surely die in the wilderness." And not a man was left of them, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun.
Numbers	Num	4	27	1	Then the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph, came near; and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah and Hoglah and Milcah and Tirzah.
Numbers	Num	4	27	2	They stood before Moses and before Eleazar the priest and before the leaders and all the congregation, at the doorway of the tent of meeting, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	27	3	"Our father died in the wilderness, yet he was not among the company of those who gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah; but he died in his own sin, and he had no sons.
Numbers	Num	4	27	4	"Why should the name of our father be withdrawn from among his family because he had no son? Give us a possession among our father's brothers."
Numbers	Num	4	27	5	So Moses brought their case before the LORD.
Numbers	Num	4	27	6	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	27	7	"The daughters of Zelophehad are right in their statements. You shall surely give them a hereditary possession among their father's brothers, and you shall transfer the inheritance of their father to them.
Numbers	Num	4	27	8	"Further, you shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'If a man dies and has no son, then you shall transfer his inheritance to his daughter.
Numbers	Num	4	27	9	'If he has no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers.
Numbers	Num	4	27	10	'If he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father's brothers.
Numbers	Num	4	27	11	'If his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his nearest relative in his own family, and he shall possess it; and it shall be a statutory ordinance to the sons of Israel, just as the LORD commanded Moses.'"
Numbers	Num	4	27	12	Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go up to this mountain of Abarim, and see the land which I have given to the sons of Israel.
Numbers	Num	4	27	13	"When you have seen it, you too will be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother was;
Numbers	Num	4	27	14	for in the wilderness of Zin, during the strife of the congregation, you rebelled against My command to treat Me as holy before their eyes at the water." (These are the waters of Meribah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.)
Numbers	Num	4	27	15	Then Moses spoke to the LORD, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	27	16	"May the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation,
Numbers	Num	4	27	17	who will go out and come in before them, and who will lead them out and bring them in, so that the congregation of the LORD will not be like sheep which have no shepherd."
Numbers	Num	4	27	18	So the LORD said to Moses, "Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and lay your hand on him;
Numbers	Num	4	27	19	and have him stand before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation, and commission him in their sight.
Numbers	Num	4	27	20	"You shall put some of your authority on him, in order that all the congregation of the sons of Israel may obey him.
Numbers	Num	4	27	21	"Moreover, he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire for him by the judgment of the Urim before the LORD. At his command they shall go out and at his command they shall come in, both he and the sons of Israel with him, even all the congregation."
Numbers	Num	4	27	22	Moses did just as the LORD commanded him; and he took Joshua and set him before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation.
Numbers	Num	4	27	23	Then he laid his hands on him and commissioned him, just as the LORD had spoken through Moses.
Numbers	Num	4	28	1	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	28	2	"Command the sons of Israel and say to them, 'You shall be careful to present My offering, My food for My offerings by fire, of a soothing aroma to Me, at their appointed time.'
Numbers	Num	4	28	3	"You shall say to them, 'This is the offering by fire which you shall offer to the LORD: two male lambs one year old without defect as a continual burnt offering every day.
Numbers	Num	4	28	4	'You shall offer the one lamb in the morning and the other lamb you shall offer at twilight;
Numbers	Num	4	28	5	also a tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a grain offering, mixed with a fourth of a hin of beaten oil.
Numbers	Num	4	28	6	'It is a continual burnt offering which was ordained in Mount Sinai as a soothing aroma, an offering by fire to the LORD.
Numbers	Num	4	28	7	'Then the drink offering with it shall be a fourth of a hin for each lamb, in the holy place you shall pour out a drink offering of strong drink to the LORD.
Numbers	Num	4	28	8	'The other lamb you shall offer at twilight; as the grain offering of the morning and as its drink offering, you shall offer it, an offering by fire, a soothing aroma to the LORD.
Numbers	Num	4	28	9	'Then on the sabbath day two male lambs one year old without defect, and two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, and its drink offering:
Numbers	Num	4	28	10	'This is the burnt offering of every sabbath in addition to the continual burnt offering and its drink offering.
Numbers	Num	4	28	11	'Then at the beginning of each of your months you shall present a burnt offering to the LORD: two bulls and one ram, seven male lambs one year old without defect;
Numbers	Num	4	28	12	and three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, for each bull; and two-tenths of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, for the one ram;
Numbers	Num	4	28	13	and a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering for each lamb, for a burnt offering of a soothing aroma, an offering by fire to the LORD.
Numbers	Num	4	28	14	'Their drink offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bull and a third of a hin for the ram and a fourth of a hin for a lamb; this is the burnt offering of each month throughout the months of the year.
Numbers	Num	4	28	15	'And one male goat for a sin offering to the LORD; it shall be offered with its drink offering in addition to the continual burnt offering.
Numbers	Num	4	28	16	'Then on the fourteenth day of the first month shall be the LORD'S Passover.
Numbers	Num	4	28	17	'On the fifteenth day of this month shall be a feast, unleavened bread shall be eaten for seven days.
Numbers	Num	4	28	18	'On the first day shall be a holy convocation; you shall do no laborious work.

Numbers	Num	4	28	20	'For their grain offering, you shall offer fine flour mixed with oil: three-tenths of an ephah for a bull and two-tenths for the ram.
Numbers	Num	4	28	21	'A tenth of an ephah you shall offer for each of the seven lambs;
Numbers	Num	4	28	22	and one male goat for a sin offering to make atonement for you.
Numbers	Num	4	28	23	'You shall present these besides the burnt offering of the morning, which is for a continual burnt offering.
Numbers	Num	4	28	24	'After this manner you shall present daily, for seven days, the food of the offering by fire, of a soothing aroma to the LORD; it shall be presented with its drink offering in addition to the continual burnt offering.
Numbers	Num	4	28	25	'On the seventh day you shall have a holy convocation; you shall do no laborious work.
Numbers	Num	4	28	26	'Also on the day of the first fruits, when you present a new grain offering to the LORD in your Feast of Weeks, you shall have a holy convocation; you shall do no laborious work.
Numbers	Num	4	28	27	'You shall offer a burnt offering for a soothing aroma to the LORD: two young bulls, one ram, seven male lambs one year old;
Numbers	Num	4	28	28	and their grain offering, fine flour mixed with oil: three-tenths of an ephah for each bull, two-tenths for the one ram,
Numbers	Num	4	28	29	a tenth for each of the seven lambs;
Numbers	Num	4	28	30	also one male goat to make atonement for you.
Numbers	Num	4	28	31	'Besides the continual burnt offering and its grain offering, you shall present them with their drink offerings. They shall be without defect.
Numbers	Num	4	29	1	'Now in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall also have a holy convocation; you shall do no laborious work. It will be to you a day for blowing trumpets.
Numbers	Num	4	29	2	'You shall offer a burnt offering as a soothing aroma to the LORD: one bull, one ram, and seven male lambs one year old without defect;
Numbers	Num	4	29	3	also their grain offering, fine flour mixed with oil: three-tenths of an ephah for the bull, two-tenths for the ram,
Numbers	Num	4	29	4	and one-tenth for each of the seven lambs.
Numbers	Num	4	29	5	'Offer one male goat for a sin offering, to make atonement for you,
Numbers	Num	4	29	6	besides the burnt offering of the new moon and its grain offering, and the continual burnt offering and its grain offering, and their drink offerings, according to their ordinance, for a soothing aroma, an offering by fire to the LORD.
Numbers	Num	4	29	7	'Then on the tenth day of this seventh month you shall have a holy convocation, and you shall humble yourselves; you shall not do any work.
Numbers	Num	4	29	8	'You shall present a burnt offering to the LORD as a soothing aroma: one bull, one ram, seven male lambs one year old, having them without defect;

Numbers	Num	4	29	40	Moses spoke to the sons of Israel in accordance with all that the LORD had commanded Moses.
Numbers	Num	4	30	1	Then Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the sons of Israel, saying, "This is the word which the LORD has commanded.
Numbers	Num	4	30	2	"If a man makes a vow to the LORD, or takes an oath to bind himself with a binding obligation, he shall not violate his word; he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.
Numbers	Num	4	30	3	"Also if a woman makes a vow to the LORD, and binds herself by an obligation in her father's house in her youth,
Numbers	Num	4	30	4	and her father hears her vow and her obligation by which she has bound herself, and her father says nothing to her, then all her vows shall stand and every obligation by which she has bound herself shall stand.
Numbers	Num	4	30	5	"But if her father should forbid her on the day he hears of it, none of her vows or her obligations by which she has bound herself shall stand; and the LORD will forgive her because her father had forbidden her.
Numbers	Num	4	30	6	"However, if she should marry while under her vows or the rash statement of her lips by which she has bound herself,
Numbers	Num	4	30	7	and her husband hears of it and says nothing to her on the day he hears it, then her vows shall stand and her obligations by which she has bound herself shall stand.
Numbers	Num	4	30	8	"But if on the day her husband hears of it, he forbids her, then he shall annul her vow which she is under and the rash statement of her lips by which she has bound herself; and the LORD will forgive her.
Numbers	Num	4	30	9	"But the vow of a widow or of a divorced woman, everything by which she has bound herself, shall stand against her.
Numbers	Num	4	30	10	"However, if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound herself by an obligation with an oath,
Numbers	Num	4	30	11	and her husband heard it, but said nothing to her and did not forbid her, then all her vows shall stand and every obligation by which she bound herself shall stand.
Numbers	Num	4	30	12	"But if her husband indeed annuls them on the day he hears them, then whatever proceeds out of her lips concerning her vows or concerning the obligation of herself shall not stand; her husband has annulled them, and the LORD will forgive her.
Numbers	Num	4	30	13	"Every vow and every binding oath to humble herself, her husband may confirm it or her husband may annul it.
Numbers	Num	4	30	14	"But if her husband indeed says nothing to her from day to day, then he confirms all her vows or all her obligations which are on her; he has confirmed them, because he said nothing to her on the day he heard them.
Numbers	Num	4	30	15	"But if he indeed annuls them after he has heard them, then he shall bear her guilt."
Numbers	Num	4	30	16	These are the statutes which the LORD commanded Moses, as between a man and his wife, and as between a father and his daughter, while she is in her youth in her father's house.
Numbers	Num	4	31	1	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	31	2	"Take full vengeance for the sons of Israel on the Midianites; afterward you will be gathered to your people."
Numbers	Num	4	31	3	Moses spoke to the people, saying, "Arm men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian to execute the LORD'S vengeance on Midian.
Numbers	Num	4	31	4	"A thousand from each tribe of all the tribes of Israel you shall send to the war."
Numbers	Num	4	31	5	So there were furnished from the thousands of Israel, a thousand from each tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.
Numbers	Num	4	31	6	Moses sent them, a thousand from each tribe, to the war, and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war with them, and the holy vessels and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand.
Numbers	Num	4	31	7	So they made war against Midian, just as the LORD had commanded Moses, and they killed every male.
Numbers	Num	4	31	8	They killed the kings of Midian along with the rest of their slain: Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba, the five kings of Midian; they also killed Balaam the son of Beor with the sword.
Numbers	Num	4	31	9	The sons of Israel captured the women of Midian and their little ones; and all their cattle and all their flocks and all their goods they plundered.
Numbers	Num	4	31	10	Then they burned all their cities where they lived and all their camps with fire.
Numbers	Num	4	31	11	They took all the spoil and all the prey, both of man and of beast.
Numbers	Num	4	31	12	They brought the captives and the prey and the spoil to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest and to the congregation of the sons of Israel, to the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by the Jordan opposite Jericho.
Numbers	Num	4	31	13	Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the leaders of the congregation went out to meet them outside the camp.
Numbers	Num	4	31	14	Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, who had come from service in the war.
Numbers	Num	4	31	15	And Moses said to them, "Have you spared all the women?
Numbers	Num	4	31	16	"Behold, these caused the sons of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, so the plague was among the congregation of the LORD.
Numbers	Num	4	31	17	"Now therefore, kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known man intimately.
Numbers	Num	4	31	18	"But all the girls who have not known man intimately, spare for yourselves.
Numbers	Num	4	31	19	"And you, camp outside the camp seven days; whoever has killed any person and whoever has touched any slain, purify yourselves, you and your captives, on the third day and on the seventh day.
Numbers	Num	4	31	20	"You shall purify for yourselves every garment and every article of leather and all the work of goats' hair, and all articles of wood."
Numbers	Num	4	31	21	Then Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who had gone to battle, "This is the statute of the law which the LORD has commanded Moses:
Numbers	Num	4	31	22	only the gold and the silver, the bronze, the iron, the tin and the lead,
Numbers	Num	4	31	23	everything that can stand the fire, you shall pass through the fire, and it shall be clean, but it shall be purified with water for impurity. But whatever cannot stand the fire you shall pass through the water.
Numbers	Num	4	31	24	"And you shall wash your clothes on the seventh day and be clean, and afterward you may enter the camp."
Numbers	Num	4	31	25	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	31	26	"You and Eleazar the priest and the heads of the fathers' households of the congregation take a count of the booty that was captured, both of man and of animal;
Numbers	Num	4	31	27	and divide the booty between the warriors who went out to battle and all the congregation.
Numbers	Num	4	31	28	"Levy a tax for the LORD from the men of war who went out to battle, one in five hundred of the persons and of the cattle and of the donkeys and of the sheep;
Numbers	Num	4	31	29	take it from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest, as an offering to the LORD.
Numbers	Num	4	31	30	"From the sons of Israel's half, you shall take one drawn out of every fifty of the persons, of the cattle, of the donkeys and of the sheep, from all the animals, and give them to the Levites who keep charge of the tabernacle of the LORD."
Numbers	Num	4	31	31	Moses and Eleazar the priest did just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Numbers	Num	4	31	32	Now the booty that remained from the spoil which the men of war had plundered was 675,sheep,
Numbers	Num	4	31	33	and 72,cattle,
Numbers	Num	4	31	34	and 61,donkeys,
Numbers	Num	4	31	35	and of human beings, of the women who had not known man intimately, all the persons were 32,000.
Numbers	Num	4	31	36	The half, the portion of those who went out to war, was as follows: the number of sheep was 337,500,
Numbers	Num	4	31	37	and the LORD'S levy of the sheep was 675;
Numbers	Num	4	31	38	and the cattle were 36,000, from which the LORD'S levy was 72;
Numbers	Num	4	31	39	and the donkeys were 30,500, from which the LORD'S levy was 61;
Numbers	Num	4	31	40	and the human beings were 16,000, from whom the LORD'S levy was persons.
Numbers	Num	4	31	41	Moses gave the levy which was the LORD'S offering to Eleazar the priest, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Numbers	Num	4	31	42	As for the sons of Israel's half, which Moses separated from the men who had gone to war--
Numbers	Num	4	31	43	now the congregation's half was 337,sheep,
Numbers	Num	4	31	44	and 36,cattle,
Numbers	Num	4	31	45	and 30,donkeys,
Numbers	Num	4	31	46	and the human beings were 16,000--
Numbers	Num	4	31	47	and from the sons of Israel's half, Moses took one drawn out of every fifty, both of man and of animals, and gave them to the Levites, who kept charge of the tabernacle of the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Numbers	Num	4	31	48	Then the officers who were over the thousands of the army, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, approached Moses,
Numbers	Num	4	31	49	and they said to Moses, "Your servants have taken a census of men of war who are in our charge, and no man of us is missing.
Numbers	Num	4	31	50	"So we have brought as an offering to the LORD what each man found, articles of gold, armlets and bracelets, signet rings, earrings and necklaces, to make atonement for ourselves before the LORD."
Numbers	Num	4	31	51	Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them, all kinds of wrought articles.
Numbers	Num	4	31	52	All the gold of the offering which they offered up to the LORD, from the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, was 16,shekels.
Numbers	Num	4	31	53	The men of war had taken booty, every man for himself.
Numbers	Num	4	31	54	So Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it to the tent of meeting as a memorial for the sons of Israel before the LORD.
Numbers	Num	4	32	1	Now the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad had an exceedingly large number of livestock. So when they saw the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead, that it was indeed a place suitable for livestock,
Numbers	Num	4	32	2	the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben came and spoke to Moses and to Eleazar the priest and to the leaders of the congregation, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	32	3	"Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo and Beon,
Numbers	Num	4	32	4	the land which the LORD conquered before the congregation of Israel, is a land for livestock, and your servants have livestock."
Numbers	Num	4	32	5	They said, "If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants as a possession; do not take us across the Jordan."
Numbers	Num	4	32	6	But Moses said to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben, "Shall your brothers go to war while you yourselves sit here?
Numbers	Num	4	32	7	"Now why are you discouraging the sons of Israel from crossing over into the land which the LORD has given them?
Numbers	Num	4	32	8	"This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.
Numbers	Num	4	32	9	"For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged the sons of Israel so that they did not go into the land which the LORD had given them.
Numbers	Num	4	32	10	"So the LORD'S anger burned in that day, and He swore, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	32	11	'None of the men who came up from Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob; for they did not follow Me fully,
Numbers	Num	4	32	12	except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua the son of Nun, for they have followed the LORD fully.'
Numbers	Num	4	32	13	"So the LORD'S anger burned against Israel, and He made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until the entire generation of those who had done evil in the sight of the LORD was destroyed.
Numbers	Num	4	32	14	"Now behold, you have risen up in your fathers' place, a brood of sinful men, to add still more to the burning anger of the LORD against Israel.
Numbers	Num	4	32	15	"For if you turn away from following Him, He will once more abandon them in the wilderness, and you will destroy all these people."
Numbers	Num	4	32	16	Then they came near to him and said, "We will build here sheepfolds for our livestock and cities for our little ones;
Numbers	Num	4	32	17	but we ourselves will be armed ready to go before the sons of Israel, until we have brought them to their place, while our little ones live in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.
Numbers	Num	4	32	18	"We will not return to our homes until every one of the sons of Israel has possessed his inheritance.
Numbers	Num	4	32	19	"For we will not have an inheritance with them on the other side of the Jordan and beyond, because our inheritance has fallen to us on this side of the Jordan toward the east."
Numbers	Num	4	32	20	So Moses said to them, "If you will do this, if you will arm yourselves before the LORD for the war,
Numbers	Num	4	32	21	and all of you armed men cross over the Jordan before the LORD until He has driven His enemies out from before Him,
Numbers	Num	4	32	22	and the land is subdued before the LORD, then afterward you shall return and be free of obligation toward the LORD and toward Israel, and this land shall be yours for a possession before the LORD.
Numbers	Num	4	32	23	"But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against the LORD, and be sure your sin will find you out.
Numbers	Num	4	32	24	"Build yourselves cities for your little ones, and sheepfolds for your sheep, and do what you have promised."
Numbers	Num	4	32	25	The sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, "Your servants will do just as my lord commands.
Numbers	Num	4	32	26	"Our little ones, our wives, our livestock and all our cattle shall remain there in the cities of Gilead;
Numbers	Num	4	32	27	while your servants, everyone who is armed for war, will cross over in the presence of the LORD to battle, just as my lord says."
Numbers	Num	4	32	28	So Moses gave command concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers' households of the tribes of the sons of Israel.
Numbers	Num	4	32	29	Moses said to them, "If the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben, everyone who is armed for battle, will cross with you over the Jordan in the presence of the LORD, and the land is subdued before you, then you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession;
Numbers	Num	4	32	30	but if they will not cross over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan."
Numbers	Num	4	32	31	The sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben answered, saying, "As the LORD has said to your servants, so we will do.
Numbers	Num	4	32	32	"We ourselves will cross over armed in the presence of the LORD into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us across the Jordan."
Numbers	Num	4	32	33	So Moses gave to them, to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben and to the half-tribe of Joseph's son Manasseh, the kingdom of Sihon, king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og, the king of Bashan, the land with its cities with their territories, the cities of the surrounding land.
Numbers	Num	4	32	34	The sons of Gad built Dibon and Ataroth and Aroer,
Numbers	Num	4	32	35	and Atroth-shophan and Jazer and Jogbehah,
Numbers	Num	4	32	36	and Beth-nimrah and Beth-haran as fortified cities, and sheepfolds for sheep.
Numbers	Num	4	32	37	The sons of Reuben built Heshbon and Elealeh and Kiriathaim,
Numbers	Num	4	32	38	and Nebo and Baal-meon--their names being changed--and Sibmah, and they gave other names to the cities which they built.
Numbers	Num	4	32	39	The sons of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead and took it, and dispossessed the Amorites who were in it.
Numbers	Num	4	32	40	So Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh, and he lived in it.
Numbers	Num	4	32	41	Jair the son of Manasseh went and took its towns, and called them Havvoth-jair.
Numbers	Num	4	32	42	Nobah went and took Kenath and its villages, and called it Nobah after his own name.
Numbers	Num	4	33	1	These are the journeys of the sons of Israel, by which they came out from the land of Egypt by their armies, under the leadership of Moses and Aaron.
Numbers	Num	4	33	2	Moses recorded their starting places according to their journeys by the command of the LORD, and these are their journeys according to their starting places.
Numbers	Num	4	33	3	They journeyed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the next day after the Passover the sons of Israel started out boldly in the sight of all the Egyptians,
Numbers	Num	4	33	4	while the Egyptians were burying all their firstborn whom the LORD had struck down among them. The LORD had also executed judgments on their gods.
Numbers	Num	4	33	5	Then the sons of Israel journeyed from Rameses and camped in Succoth.
Numbers	Num	4	33	6	They journeyed from Succoth and camped in Etham, which is on the edge of the wilderness.
Numbers	Num	4	33	7	They journeyed from Etham and turned back to Pi-hahiroth, which faces Baal-zephon, and they camped before Migdol.
Numbers	Num	4	33	8	They journeyed from before Hahiroth and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness; and they went three days' journey in the wilderness of Etham and camped at Marah.
Numbers	Num	4	33	9	They journeyed from Marah and came to Elim; and in Elim there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees, and they camped there.
Numbers	Num	4	33	10	They journeyed from Elim and camped by the Red Sea.
Numbers	Num	4	33	11	They journeyed from the Red Sea and camped in the wilderness of Sin.
Numbers	Num	4	33	12	They journeyed from the wilderness of Sin and camped at Dophkah.
Numbers	Num	4	33	13	They journeyed from Dophkah and camped at Alush.
Numbers	Num	4	33	14	They journeyed from Alush and camped at Rephidim; now it was there that the people had no water to drink.
Numbers	Num	4	33	15	They journeyed from Rephidim and camped in the wilderness of Sinai.
Numbers	Num	4	33	16	They journeyed from the wilderness of Sinai and camped at Kibroth-hattaavah.
Numbers	Num	4	33	17	They journeyed from Kibroth-hattaavah and camped at Hazeroth.
Numbers	Num	4	33	18	They journeyed from Hazeroth and camped at Rithmah.
Numbers	Num	4	33	19	They journeyed from Rithmah and camped at Rimmon-perez.
Numbers	Num	4	33	20	They journeyed from Rimmon-perez and camped at Libnah.
Numbers	Num	4	33	21	They journeyed from Libnah and camped at Rissah.
Numbers	Num	4	33	22	They journeyed from Rissah and camped in Kehelathah.
Numbers	Num	4	33	23	They journeyed from Kehelathah and camped at Mount Shepher.
Numbers	Num	4	33	24	They journeyed from Mount Shepher and camped at Haradah.
Numbers	Num	4	33	25	They journeyed from Haradah and camped at Makheloth.
Numbers	Num	4	33	26	They journeyed from Makheloth and camped at Tahath.
Numbers	Num	4	33	27	They journeyed from Tahath and camped at Terah.
Numbers	Num	4	33	28	They journeyed from Terah and camped at Mithkah.
Numbers	Num	4	33	29	They journeyed from Mithkah and camped at Hashmonah.
Numbers	Num	4	33	30	They journeyed from Hashmonah and camped at Moseroth.
Numbers	Num	4	33	31	They journeyed from Moseroth and camped at Bene-jaakan.
Numbers	Num	4	33	32	They journeyed from Bene-jaakan and camped at Hor-haggidgad.
Numbers	Num	4	33	33	They journeyed from Hor-haggidgad and camped at Jotbathah.
Numbers	Num	4	33	34	They journeyed from Jotbathah and camped at Abronah.
Numbers	Num	4	33	35	They journeyed from Abronah and camped at Ezion-geber.
Numbers	Num	4	33	36	They journeyed from Ezion-geber and camped in the wilderness of Zin, that is, Kadesh.
Numbers	Num	4	33	37	They journeyed from Kadesh and camped at Mount Hor, at the edge of the land of Edom.
Numbers	Num	4	33	38	Then Aaron the priest went up to Mount Hor at the command of the LORD, and died there in the fortieth year after the sons of Israel had come from the land of Egypt, on the first day in the fifth month.
Numbers	Num	4	33	39	Aaron was one hundred twenty-three years old when he died on Mount Hor.
Numbers	Num	4	33	40	Now the Canaanite, the king of Arad who lived in the Negev in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the sons of Israel.
Numbers	Num	4	33	41	Then they journeyed from Mount Hor and camped at Zalmonah.
Numbers	Num	4	33	42	They journeyed from Zalmonah and camped at Punon.
Numbers	Num	4	33	43	They journeyed from Punon and camped at Oboth.
Numbers	Num	4	33	44	They journeyed from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim, at the border of Moab.
Numbers	Num	4	33	45	They journeyed from Iyim and camped at Dibon-gad.
Numbers	Num	4	33	46	They journeyed from Dibon-gad and camped at Almon-diblathaim.
Numbers	Num	4	33	47	They journeyed from Almon-diblathaim and camped in the mountains of Abarim, before Nebo.
Numbers	Num	4	33	48	They journeyed from the mountains of Abarim and camped in the plains of Moab by the Jordan opposite Jericho.
Numbers	Num	4	33	49	They camped by the Jordan, from Beth-jeshimoth as far as Abel-shittim in the plains of Moab.
Numbers	Num	4	33	50	Then the LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan opposite Jericho, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	33	51	"Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'When you cross over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
Numbers	Num	4	33	52	then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their figured stones, and destroy all their molten images and demolish all their high places;
Numbers	Num	4	33	53	and you shall take possession of the land and live in it, for I have given the land to you to possess it.
Numbers	Num	4	33	54	'You shall inherit the land by lot according to your families; to the larger you shall give more inheritance, and to the smaller you shall give less inheritance. Wherever the lot falls to anyone, that shall be his. You shall inherit according to the tribes of your fathers.
Numbers	Num	4	33	55	'But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then it shall come about that those whom you let remain of them will become as pricks in your eyes and as thorns in your sides, and they will trouble you in the land in which you live.
Numbers	Num	4	33	56	'And as I plan to do to them, so I will do to you.'"
Numbers	Num	4	34	1	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	34	2	"Command the sons of Israel and say to them, 'When you enter the land of Canaan, this is the land that shall fall to you as an inheritance, even the land of Canaan according to its borders.
Numbers	Num	4	34	3	'Your southern sector shall extend from the wilderness of Zin along the side of Edom, and your southern border shall extend from the end of the Salt Sea eastward.
Numbers	Num	4	34	4	'Then your border shall turn direction from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim and continue to Zin, and its termination shall be to the south of Kadesh-barnea; and it shall reach Hazaraddar and continue to Azmon.
Numbers	Num	4	34	5	'The border shall turn direction from Azmon to the brook of Egypt, and its termination shall be at the sea.
Numbers	Num	4	34	6	'As for the western border, you shall have the Great Sea, that is, its coastline; this shall be your west border.
Numbers	Num	4	34	7	'And this shall be your north border: you shall draw your border line from the Great Sea to Mount Hor.
Numbers	Num	4	34	8	'You shall draw a line from Mount Hor to the Lebo-hamath, and the termination of the border shall be at Zedad;
Numbers	Num	4	34	9	and the border shall proceed to Ziphron, and its termination shall be at Hazar-enan. This shall be your north border.
Numbers	Num	4	34	10	'For your eastern border you shall also draw a line from Hazar-enan to Shepham,
Numbers	Num	4	34	11	and the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain; and the border shall go down and reach to the slope on the east side of the Sea of Chinnereth.
Numbers	Num	4	34	12	'And the border shall go down to the Jordan and its termination shall be at the Salt Sea. This shall be your land according to its borders all around.'"
Numbers	Num	4	34	13	So Moses commanded the sons of Israel, saying, "This is the land that you are to apportion by lot among you as a possession, which the LORD has commanded to give to the nine and a half tribes.
Numbers	Num	4	34	14	"For the tribe of the sons of Reuben have received theirs according to their fathers' households, and the tribe of the sons of Gad according to their fathers' households, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their possession.
Numbers	Num	4	34	15	"The two and a half tribes have received their possession across the Jordan opposite Jericho, eastward toward the sunrising."
Numbers	Num	4	34	16	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	34	17	"These are the names of the men who shall apportion the land to you for inheritance: Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun.
Numbers	Num	4	34	18	"You shall take one leader of every tribe to apportion the land for inheritance.
Numbers	Num	4	34	19	"These are the names of the men: of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.
Numbers	Num	4	34	20	"Of the tribe of the sons of Simeon, Samuel the son of Ammihud.
Numbers	Num	4	34	21	"Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon.
Numbers	Num	4	34	22	"Of the tribe of the sons of Dan a leader, Bukki the son of Jogli.
Numbers	Num	4	34	23	"Of the sons of Joseph: of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh a leader, Hanniel the son of Ephod.
Numbers	Num	4	34	24	"Of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim a leader, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan.
Numbers	Num	4	34	25	"Of the tribe of the sons of Zebulun a leader, Elizaphan the son of Parnach.
Numbers	Num	4	34	26	"Of the tribe of the sons of Issachar a leader, Paltiel the son of Azzan.
Numbers	Num	4	34	27	"Of the tribe of the sons of Asher a leader, Ahihud the son of Shelomi.
Numbers	Num	4	34	28	"Of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali a leader, Pedahel the son of Ammihud."
Numbers	Num	4	34	29	These are those whom the LORD commanded to apportion the inheritance to the sons of Israel in the land of Canaan.
Numbers	Num	4	35	1	Now the LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan opposite Jericho, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	35	2	"Command the sons of Israel that they give to the Levites from the inheritance of their possession cities to live in; and you shall give to the Levites pasture lands around the cities.
Numbers	Num	4	35	3	"The cities shall be theirs to live in; and their pasture lands shall be for their cattle and for their herds and for all their beasts.
Numbers	Num	4	35	4	"The pasture lands of the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall extend from the wall of the city outward a thousand cubits around.
Numbers	Num	4	35	5	"You shall also measure outside the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits, with the city in the center. This shall become theirs as pasture lands for the cities.
Numbers	Num	4	35	6	"The cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be the six cities of refuge, which you shall give for the manslayer to flee to; and in addition to them you shall give forty-two cities.
Numbers	Num	4	35	7	"All the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be forty-eight cities, together with their pasture lands.
Numbers	Num	4	35	8	"As for the cities which you shall give from the possession of the sons of Israel, you shall take more from the larger and you shall take less from the smaller; each shall give some of his cities to the Levites in proportion to his possession which he inherits."
Numbers	Num	4	35	9	Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	Num	4	35	10	"Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
Numbers	Num	4	35	11	then you shall select for yourselves cities to be your cities of refuge, that the manslayer who has killed any person unintentionally may flee there.
Numbers	Num	4	35	12	'The cities shall be to you as a refuge from the avenger, so that the manslayer will not die until he stands before the congregation for trial.
Numbers	Num	4	35	13	'The cities which you are to give shall be your six cities of refuge.
Numbers	Num	4	35	14	'You shall give three cities across the Jordan and three cities in the land of Canaan; they are to be cities of refuge.
Numbers	Num	4	35	15	'These six cities shall be for refuge for the sons of Israel, and for the alien and for the sojourner among them; that anyone who kills a person unintentionally may flee there.
Numbers	Num	4	35	16	'But if he struck him down with an iron object, so that he died, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death.
Numbers	Num	4	35	17	'If he struck him down with a stone in the hand, by which he will die, and as a result he died, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death.
Numbers	Num	4	35	18	'Or if he struck him with a wooden object in the hand, by which he might die, and as a result he died, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death.
Numbers	Num	4	35	19	'The blood avenger himself shall put the murderer to death; he shall put him to death when he meets him.
Numbers	Num	4	35	20	'If he pushed him of hatred, or threw something at him lying in wait and as a result he died,
Numbers	Num	4	35	21	or if he struck him down with his hand in enmity, and as a result he died, the one who struck him shall surely be put to death, he is a murderer; the blood avenger shall put the murderer to death when he meets him.
Numbers	Num	4	35	22	'But if he pushed him suddenly without enmity, or threw something at him without lying in wait,
Numbers	Num	4	35	23	or with any deadly object of stone, and without seeing it dropped on him so that he died, while he was not his enemy nor seeking his injury,
Numbers	Num	4	35	24	then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the blood avenger according to these ordinances.
Numbers	Num	4	35	25	'The congregation shall deliver the manslayer from the hand of the blood avenger, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge to which he fled; and he shall live in it until the death of the high priest who was anointed with the holy oil.
Numbers	Num	4	35	26	'But if the manslayer at any time goes beyond the border of his city of refuge to which he may flee,
Numbers	Num	4	35	27	and the blood avenger finds him outside the border of his city of refuge, and the blood avenger kills the manslayer, he will not be guilty of blood
Numbers	Num	4	35	28	because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest. But after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return to the land of his possession.
Numbers	Num	4	35	29	'These things shall be for a statutory ordinance to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
Numbers	Num	4	35	30	'If anyone kills a person, the murderer shall be put to death at the evidence of witnesses, but no person shall be put to death on the testimony of one witness.
Numbers	Num	4	35	31	'Moreover, you shall not take ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of death, but he shall surely be put to death.
Numbers	Num	4	35	32	'You shall not take ransom for him who has fled to his city of refuge, that he may return to live in the land before the death of the priest.
Numbers	Num	4	35	33	'So you shall not pollute the land in which you are; for blood pollutes the land and no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed on it, except by the blood of him who shed it.
Numbers	Num	4	35	34	'You shall not defile the land in which you live, in the midst of which I dwell; for I the LORD am dwelling in the midst of the sons of Israel.'"
Numbers	Num	4	36	1	And the heads of the fathers' households of the family of the sons of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near and spoke before Moses and before the leaders, the heads of the fathers' households of the sons of Israel,
Numbers	Num	4	36	2	and they said, "The LORD commanded my lord to give the land by lot to the sons of Israel as an inheritance, and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters.
Numbers	Num	4	36	3	"But if they marry one of the sons of the other tribes of the sons of Israel, their inheritance will be withdrawn from the inheritance of our fathers and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they belong; thus it will be withdrawn from our allotted inheritance.
Numbers	Num	4	36	4	"When the jubilee of the sons of Israel comes, then their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they belong; so their inheritance will be withdrawn from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers."
Numbers	Num	4	36	5	Then Moses commanded the sons of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying, "The tribe of the sons of Joseph are right in their statements.
Numbers	Num	4	36	6	"This is what the LORD has commanded concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, 'Let them marry whom they wish; only they must marry within the family of the tribe of their father.'
Numbers	Num	4	36	7	"Thus no inheritance of the sons of Israel shall be transferred from tribe to tribe, for the sons of Israel shall each hold to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
Numbers	Num	4	36	8	"Every daughter who comes into possession of an inheritance of any tribe of the sons of Israel shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father, so that the sons of Israel each may possess the inheritance of his fathers.
Numbers	Num	4	36	9	"Thus no inheritance shall be transferred from one tribe to another tribe, for the tribes of the sons of Israel shall each hold to his own inheritance."
Numbers	Num	4	36	10	Just as the LORD had commanded Moses, so the daughters of Zelophehad did:
Numbers	Num	4	36	11	Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad married their uncles' sons.
Numbers	Num	4	36	12	They married those from the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained with the tribe of the family of their father.
Numbers	Num	4	36	13	These are the commandments and the ordinances which the LORD commanded to the sons of Israel through Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan opposite Jericho.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	1	These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel across the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel and Laban and Hazeroth and Dizahab.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	2	It is eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	3	In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses spoke to the children of Israel, according to all that the LORD had commanded him to give to them,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	4	after he had defeated Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth and Edrei.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	5	Across the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses undertook to expound this law, saying,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	6	"The LORD our God spoke to us at Horeb, saying, 'You have stayed long enough at this mountain.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	7	'Turn and set your journey, and go to the hill country of the Amorites, and to all their neighbors in the Arabah, in the hill country and in the lowland and in the Negev and by the seacoast, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	8	'See, I have placed the land before you; go in and possess the land which the LORD swore to give to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to them and their descendants after them.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	9	"I spoke to you at that time, saying, 'I am not able to bear the burden of you alone.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	10	'The LORD your God has multiplied you, and behold, you are this day like the stars of heaven in number.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	11	'May the LORD, the God of your fathers, increase you a thousand-fold more than you are and bless you, just as He has promised you!
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	12	'How can I alone bear the load and burden of you and your strife?
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	13	'Choose wise and discerning and experienced men from your tribes, and I will appoint them as your heads.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	14	"You answered me and said, 'The thing which you have said to do is good.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	15	"So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and experienced men, and appointed them heads over you, leaders of thousands and of hundreds, of fifties and of tens, and officers for your tribes.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	16	"Then I charged your judges at that time, saying, 'Hear the cases between your fellow countrymen, and judge righteously between a man and his fellow countryman, or the alien who is with him.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	17	'You shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small and the great alike. You shall not fear man, for the judgment is God's. The case that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	18	"I commanded you at that time all the things that you should do.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	19	"Then we set out from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw on the way to the hill country of the Amorites, just as the LORD our God had commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	20	"I said to you, 'You have come to the hill country of the Amorites which the LORD our God is about to give us.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	21	'See, the LORD your God has placed the land before you; go up, take possession, as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has spoken to you. Do not fear or be dismayed.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	22	"Then all of you approached me and said, 'Let us send men before us, that they may search out the land for us, and bring back to us word of the way by which we should go up and the cities which we shall enter.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	23	"The thing pleased me and I took twelve of your men, one man for each tribe.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	24	"They turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the valley of Eshcol and spied it out.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	25	"Then they took some of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down to us; and they brought us back a report and said, 'It is a good land which the LORD our God is about to give us.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	26	"Yet you were not willing to go up, but rebelled against the command of the LORD your God;
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	27	and you grumbled in your tents and said, 'Because the LORD hates us, He has brought us out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	28	'Where can we go up? Our brethren have made our hearts melt, saying, "The people are bigger and taller than we; the cities are large and fortified to heaven. And besides, we saw the sons of the Anakim there."'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	29	"Then I said to you, 'Do not be shocked, nor fear them.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	30	'The LORD your God who goes before you will Himself fight on your behalf, just as He did for you in Egypt before your eyes,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	31	and in the wilderness where you saw how the LORD your God carried you, just as a man carries his son, in all the way which you have walked until you came to this place.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	32	"But for all this, you did not trust the LORD your God,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	33	who goes before you on your way, to seek out a place for you to encamp, in fire by night and cloud by day, to show you the way in which you should go.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	34	"Then the LORD heard the sound of your words, and He was angry and took an oath, saying,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	35	'Not one of these men, this evil generation, shall see the good land which I swore to give your fathers,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	36	except Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him and to his sons I will give the land on which he has set foot, because he has followed the LORD fully.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	37	"The LORD was angry with me also on your account, saying, 'Not even you shall enter there.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	38	'Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall enter there; encourage him, for he will cause Israel to inherit it.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	39	'Moreover, your little ones who you said would become a prey, and your sons, who this day have no knowledge of good or evil, shall enter there, and I will give it to them and they shall possess it.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	40	'But as for you, turn around and set out for the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	41	"Then you said to me, 'We have sinned against the LORD; we will indeed go up and fight, just as the LORD our God commanded us.' And every man of you girded on his weapons of war, and regarded it as easy to go up into the hill country.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	42	"And the LORD said to me, 'Say to them, "Do not go up nor fight, for I am not among you; otherwise you will be defeated before your enemies."'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	43	"So I spoke to you, but you would not listen. Instead you rebelled against the command of the LORD, and acted presumptuously and went up into the hill country.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	44	"The Amorites who lived in that hill country came out against you and chased you as bees do, and crushed you from Seir to Hormah.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	45	"Then you returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD did not listen to your voice nor give ear to you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	1	46	"So you remained in Kadesh many days, the days that you spent there.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	1	"Then we turned and set out for the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea, as the LORD spoke to me, and circled Mount Seir for many days.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	2	"And the LORD spoke to me, saying,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	3	'You have circled this mountain long enough. Now turn north,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	4	and command the people, saying, "You will pass through the territory of your brothers the sons of Esau who live in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. So be very careful;
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	5	do not provoke them, for I will not give you any of their land, even as little as a footstep because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	6	"You shall buy food from them with money so that you may eat, and you shall also purchase water from them with money so that you may drink.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	7	"For the LORD your God has blessed you in all that you have done; He has known your wanderings through this great wilderness. These forty years the LORD your God has been with you; you have not lacked a thing."'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	8	"So we passed beyond our brothers the sons of Esau, who live in Seir, away from the Arabah road, away from Elath and from Ezion-geber. And we turned and passed through by the way of the wilderness of Moab.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	9	"Then the LORD said to me, 'Do not harass Moab, nor provoke them to war, for I will not give you any of their land as a possession, because I have given Ar to the sons of Lot as a possession.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	10	(The Emim lived there formerly, a people as great, numerous, and tall as the Anakim.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	11	Like the Anakim, they are also regarded as Rephaim, but the Moabites call them Emim.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	12	The Horites formerly lived in Seir, but the sons of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them from before them and settled in their place, just as Israel did to the land of their possession which the LORD gave to them.)
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	13	'Now arise and cross over the brook Zered yourselves.' So we crossed over the brook Zered.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	14	"Now the time that it took for us to come from Kadesh-barnea until we crossed over the brook Zered was thirty-eight years, until all the generation of the men of war perished from within the camp, as the LORD had sworn to them.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	15	"Moreover the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from within the camp until they all perished.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	16	"So it came about when all the men of war had finally perished from among the people,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	17	that the LORD spoke to me, saying,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	18	'Today you shall cross over Ar, the border of Moab.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	19	'When you come opposite the sons of Ammon, do not harass them nor provoke them, for I will not give you any of the land of the sons of Ammon as a possession, because I have given it to the sons of Lot as a possession.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	20	(It is also regarded as the land of the Rephaim, for Rephaim formerly lived in it, but the Ammonites call them Zamzummin,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	21	a people as great, numerous, and tall as the Anakim, but the LORD destroyed them before them. And they dispossessed them and settled in their place,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	22	just as He did for the sons of Esau, who live in Seir, when He destroyed the Horites from before them; they dispossessed them and settled in their place even to this day.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	23	And the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim who came from Caphtor, destroyed them and lived in their place.)
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	24	'Arise, set out, and pass through the valley of Arnon. Look! I have given Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land into your hand; begin to take possession and contend with him in battle.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	25	'This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the peoples everywhere under the heavens, who, when they hear the report of you, will tremble and be in anguish because of you.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	26	"So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	27	'Let me pass through your land, I will travel only on the highway; I will not turn aside to the right or to the left.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	28	'You will sell me food for money so that I may eat, and give me water for money so that I may drink, only let me pass through on foot,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	29	just as the sons of Esau who live in Seir and the Moabites who live in Ar did for me, until I cross over the Jordan into the land which the LORD our God is giving to us.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	30	"But Sihon king of Heshbon was not willing for us to pass through his land; for the LORD your God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, in order to deliver him into your hand, as he is today.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	31	"The LORD said to me, 'See, I have begun to deliver Sihon and his land over to you. Begin to occupy, that you may possess his land.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	32	"Then Sihon with all his people came out to meet us in battle at Jahaz.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	33	"The LORD our God delivered him over to us, and we defeated him with his sons and all his people.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	34	"So we captured all his cities at that time and utterly destroyed the men, women and children of every city. We left no survivor.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	35	"We took only the animals as our booty and the spoil of the cities which we had captured.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	36	"From Aroer which is on the edge of the valley of Arnon and from the city which is in the valley, even to Gilead, there was no city that was too high for us; the LORD our God delivered all over to us.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	2	37	"Only you did not go near to the land of the sons of Ammon, all along the river Jabbok and the cities of the hill country, and wherever the LORD our God had commanded us.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	3	1	"Then we turned and went up the road to Bashan, and Og, king of Bashan, with all his people came out to meet us in battle at Edrei.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	3	2	"But the LORD said to me, 'Do not fear him, for I have delivered him and all his people and his land into your hand; and you shall do to him just as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	3	3	"So the LORD our God delivered Og also, king of Bashan, with all his people into our hand, and we smote them until no survivor was left.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	3	4	"We captured all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we did not take from them: sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	3	5	"All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates and bars, besides a great many unwalled towns.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	3	6	"We utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women and children of every city.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	3	7	"But all the animals and the spoil of the cities we took as our booty.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	3	8	"Thus we took the land at that time from the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of Arnon to Mount Hermon
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	3	9	(Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir):
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	3	10	all the cities of the plateau and all Gilead and all Bashan, as far as Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	3	11	(For only Og king of Bashan was left of the remnant of the Rephaim. Behold, his bedstead was an iron bedstead; it is in Rabbah of the sons of Ammon. Its length was nine cubits and its width four cubits by ordinary cubit.)
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	3	12	"So we took possession of this land at that time. From Aroer, which is by the valley of Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead and its cities I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	3	13	"The rest of Gilead and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh, all the region of Argob (concerning all Bashan, it is called the land of Rephaim.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	3	14	Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called it, that is, Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth-jair, as it is to this day.)
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	3	15	"To Machir I gave Gilead.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	3	16	"To the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even as far as the valley of Arnon, the middle of the valley as a border and as far as the river Jabbok, the border of the sons of Ammon;
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	3	17	the Arabah also, with the Jordan as a border, from Chinnereth even as far as the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, at the foot of the slopes of Pisgah on the east.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	3	18	"Then I commanded you at that time, saying, 'The LORD your God has given you this land to possess it; all you valiant men shall cross over armed before your brothers, the sons of Israel.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	3	19	'But your wives and your little ones and your livestock (I know that you have much livestock) shall remain in your cities which I have given you,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	3	20	until the LORD gives rest to your fellow countrymen as to you, and they also possess the land which the LORD your God will give them beyond the Jordan. Then you may return every man to his possession which I have given you.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	3	21	"I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, 'Your eyes have seen all that the LORD your God has done to these two kings; so the LORD shall do to all the kingdoms into which you are about to cross.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	3	22	'Do not fear them, for the LORD your God is the one fighting for you.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	3	23	"I also pleaded with the LORD at that time, saying,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	3	24	'O Lord GOD, You have begun to show Your servant Your greatness and Your strong hand; for what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do such works and mighty acts as Yours?
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	3	25	'Let me, I pray, cross over and see the fair land that is beyond the Jordan, that good hill country and Lebanon.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	3	26	"But the LORD was angry with me on your account, and would not listen to me; and the LORD said to me, 'Enough! Speak to Me no more of this matter.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	3	27	'Go up to the top of Pisgah and lift up your eyes to the west and north and south and east, and see it with your eyes, for you shall not cross over this Jordan.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	3	28	'But charge Joshua and encourage him and strengthen him, for he shall go across at the head of this people, and he will give them as an inheritance the land which you will see.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	3	29	"So we remained in the valley opposite Beth-peor.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	1	"Now, O Israel, listen to the statutes and the judgments which I am teaching you to perform, so that you may live and go in and take possession of the land which the LORD, the God of your fathers, is giving you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	2	"You shall not add to the word which I am commanding you, nor take away from it, that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	3	"Your eyes have seen what the LORD has done in the case of Baal-peor, for all the men who followed Baal-peor, the LORD your God has destroyed them from among you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	4	"But you who held fast to the LORD your God are alive today, every one of you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	5	"See, I have taught you statutes and judgments just as the LORD my God commanded me, that you should do thus in the land where you are entering to possess it.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	6	"So keep and do them, for that is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples who will hear all these statutes and say, 'Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	7	"For what great nation is there that has a god so near to it as is the LORD our God whenever we call on Him?
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	8	"Or what great nation is there that has statutes and judgments as righteous as this whole law which I am setting before you today?
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	9	"Only give heed to yourself and keep your soul diligently, so that you do not forget the things which your eyes have seen and they do not depart from your heart all the days of your life; but make them known to your sons and your grandsons.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	10	"Remember the day you stood before the LORD your God at Horeb, when the LORD said to me, 'Assemble the people to Me, that I may let them hear My words so they may learn to fear Me all the days they live on the earth, and that they may teach their children.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	11	"You came near and stood at the foot of the mountain, and the mountain burned with fire to the very heart of the heavens: darkness, cloud and thick gloom.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	12	"Then the LORD spoke to you from the midst of the fire; you heard the sound of words, but you saw no form--only a voice.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	13	"So He declared to you His covenant which He commanded you to perform, that is, the Ten Commandments; and He wrote them on two tablets of stone.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	14	"The LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that you might perform them in the land where you are going over to possess it.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	15	"So watch yourselves carefully, since you did not see any form on the day the LORD spoke to you at Horeb from the midst of the fire,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	16	so that you do not act corruptly and make a graven image for yourselves in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	17	the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the sky,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	18	the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water below the earth.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	19	"And beware not to lift up your eyes to heaven and see the sun and the moon and the stars, all the host of heaven, and be drawn away and worship them and serve them, those which the LORD your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole heaven.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	20	"But the LORD has taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace, from Egypt, to be a people for His own possession, as today.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	21	"Now the LORD was angry with me on your account, and swore that I would not cross the Jordan, and that I would not enter the good land which the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	22	"For I will die in this land, I shall not cross the Jordan, but you shall cross and take possession of this good land.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	23	"So watch yourselves, that you do not forget the covenant of the LORD your God which He made with you, and make for yourselves a graven image in the form of anything against which the LORD your God has commanded you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	24	"For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	25	"When you become the father of children and children's children and have remained long in the land, and act corruptly, and make an idol in the form of anything, and do that which is evil in the sight of the LORD your God so as to provoke Him to anger,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	26	I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that you will surely perish quickly from the land where you are going over the Jordan to possess it. You shall not live long on it, but will be utterly destroyed.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	27	"The LORD will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in number among the nations where the LORD drives you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	28	"There you will serve gods, the work of man's hands, wood and stone, which neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	29	"But from there you will seek the LORD your God, and you will find Him if you search for Him with all your heart and all your soul.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	30	"When you are in distress and all these things have come upon you, in the latter days you will return to the LORD your God and listen to His voice.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	31	"For the LORD your God is a compassionate God; He will not fail you nor destroy you nor forget the covenant with your fathers which He swore to them.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	32	"Indeed, ask now concerning the former days which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and inquire from one end of the heavens to the other. Has anything been done like this great thing, or has anything been heard like it?
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	33	"Has any people heard the voice of God speaking from the midst of the fire, as you have heard it, and survived?
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	34	"Or has a god tried to go to take for himself a nation from within another nation by trials, by signs and wonders and by war and by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm and by great terrors, as the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	35	"To you it was shown that you might know that the LORD, He is God; there is no other besides Him.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	36	"Out of the heavens He let you hear His voice to discipline you; and on earth He let you see His great fire, and you heard His words from the midst of the fire.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	37	"Because He loved your fathers, therefore He chose their descendants after them. And He personally brought you from Egypt by His great power,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	38	driving out from before you nations greater and mightier than you, to bring you in and to give you their land for an inheritance, as it is today.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	39	"Know therefore today, and take it to your heart, that the LORD, He is God in heaven above and on the earth below; there is no other.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	40	"So you shall keep His statutes and His commandments which I am giving you today, that it may go well with you and with your children after you, and that you may live long on the land which the LORD your God is giving you for all time."
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	41	Then Moses set apart three cities across the Jordan to the east,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	42	that a manslayer might flee there, who unintentionally slew his neighbor without having enmity toward him in time past; and by fleeing to one of these cities he might live:
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	43	Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau for the Reubenites, and Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	44	Now this is the law which Moses set before the sons of Israel;
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	45	these are the testimonies and the statutes and the ordinances which Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, when they came out from Egypt,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	46	across the Jordan, in the valley opposite Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites who lived at Heshbon, whom Moses and the sons of Israel defeated when they came out from Egypt.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	47	They took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who were across the Jordan to the east,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	48	from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of Arnon, even as far as Mount Sion (that is, Hermon),
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	4	49	with all the Arabah across the Jordan to the east, even as far as the sea of the Arabah, at the foot of the slopes of Pisgah.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	5	1	Then Moses summoned all Israel and said to them: "Hear, O Israel, the statutes and the ordinances which I am speaking today in your hearing, that you may learn them and observe them carefully.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	5	2	"The LORD our God made a covenant with us at Horeb.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	5	3	"The LORD did not make this covenant with our fathers, but with us, with all those of us alive here today.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	5	4	"The LORD spoke to you face to face at the mountain from the midst of the fire,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	5	5	while I was standing between the LORD and you at that time, to declare to you the word of the LORD; for you were afraid because of the fire and did not go up the mountain. He said,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	5	6	'I am the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	5	7	'You shall have no other gods before Me.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	5	8	'You shall not make for yourself an idol, or any likeness of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water under the earth.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	5	9	'You shall not worship them or serve them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	5	10	but showing lovingkindness to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	5	11	'You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not leave him unpunished who takes His name in vain.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	5	12	'Observe the sabbath day to keep it holy, as the LORD your God commanded you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	5	13	'Six days you shall labor and do all your work,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	5	14	but the seventh day is a sabbath of the LORD your God; in it you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter or your male servant or your female servant or your ox or your donkey or any of your cattle or your sojourner who stays with you, so that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	5	15	'You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God brought you out of there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm; therefore the LORD your God commanded you to observe the sabbath day.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	5	16	'Honor your father and your mother, as the LORD your God has commanded you, that your days may be prolonged and that it may go well with you on the land which the LORD your God gives you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	5	17	'You shall not murder.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	5	18	'You shall not commit adultery.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	5	19	'You shall not steal.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	5	20	'You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	5	21	'You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, and you shall not desire your neighbor's house, his field or his male servant or his female servant, his ox or his donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	5	22	"These words the LORD spoke to all your assembly at the mountain from the midst of the fire, of the cloud and of the thick gloom, with a great voice, and He added no more. He wrote them on two tablets of stone and gave them to me.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	5	23	"And when you heard the voice from the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, you came near to me, all the heads of your tribes and your elders.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	5	24	"You said, 'Behold, the LORD our God has shown us His glory and His greatness, and we have heard His voice from the midst of the fire; we have seen today that God speaks with man, yet he lives.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	5	25	'Now then why should we die? For this great fire will consume us; if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any longer, then we will die.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	5	26	'For who is there of all flesh who has heard the voice of the living God speaking from the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	5	27	'Go near and hear all that the LORD our God says; then speak to us all that the LORD our God speaks to you, and we will hear and do it.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	5	28	"The LORD heard the voice of your words when you spoke to me, and the LORD said to me, 'I have heard the voice of the words of this people which they have spoken to you. They have done well in all that they have spoken.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	5	29	'Oh that they had such a heart in them, that they would fear Me and keep all My commandments always, that it may be well with them and with their sons forever!
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	5	30	'Go, say to them, "Return to your tents."
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	5	31	'But as for you, stand here by Me, that I may speak to you all the commandments and the statutes and the judgments which you shall teach them, that they may observe them in the land which I give them to possess.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	5	32	"So you shall observe to do just as the LORD your God has commanded you; you shall not turn aside to the right or to the left.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	5	33	"You shall walk in all the way which the LORD your God has commanded you, that you may live and that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which you will possess.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	6	1	"Now this is the commandment, the statutes and the judgments which the LORD your God has commanded me to teach you, that you might do them in the land where you are going over to possess it,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	6	2	so that you and your son and your grandson might fear the LORD your God, to keep all His statutes and His commandments which I command you, all the days of your life, and that your days may be prolonged.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	6	3	"O Israel, you should listen and be careful to do it, that it may be well with you and that you may multiply greatly, just as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has promised you, in a land flowing with milk and honey.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	6	4	"Hear, O Israel! The LORD is our God, the LORD is one!
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	6	5	"You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	6	6	"These words, which I am commanding you today, shall be on your heart.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	6	7	"You shall teach them diligently to your sons and shall talk of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way and when you lie down and when you rise up.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	6	8	"You shall bind them as a sign on your hand and they shall be as frontals on your forehead.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	6	9	"You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	6	10	"Then it shall come about when the LORD your God brings you into the land which He swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, to give you, great and splendid cities which you did not build,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	6	11	and houses full of all good things which you did not fill, and hewn cisterns which you did not dig, vineyards and olive trees which you did not plant, and you eat and are satisfied,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	6	12	then watch yourself, that you do not forget the LORD who brought you from the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	6	13	"You shall fear only the LORD your God; and you shall worship Him and swear by His name.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	6	14	"You shall not follow other gods, any of the gods of the peoples who surround you,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	6	15	for the LORD your God in the midst of you is a jealous God; otherwise the anger of the LORD your God will be kindled against you, and He will wipe you off the face of the earth.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	6	16	"You shall not put the LORD your God to the test, as you tested Him at Massah.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	6	17	"You should diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and His testimonies and His statutes which He has commanded you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	6	18	"You shall do what is right and good in the sight of the LORD, that it may be well with you and that you may go in and possess the good land which the LORD swore to give your fathers,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	6	19	by driving out all your enemies from before you, as the LORD has spoken.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	6	20	"When your son asks you in time to come, saying, 'What do the testimonies and the statutes and the judgments mean which the LORD our God commanded you?'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	6	21	then you shall say to your son, 'We were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt, and the LORD brought us from Egypt with a mighty hand.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	6	22	'Moreover, the LORD showed great and distressing signs and wonders before our eyes against Egypt, Pharaoh and all his household;
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	6	23	He brought us out from there in order to bring us in, to give us the land which He had sworn to our fathers.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	6	24	"So the LORD commanded us to observe all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God for our good always and for our survival, as it is today.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	6	25	"It will be righteousness for us if we are careful to observe all this commandment before the LORD our God, just as He commanded us.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	7	1	"When the LORD your God brings you into the land where you are entering to possess it, and clears away many nations before you, the Hittites and the Girgashites and the Amorites and the Canaanites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and stronger than you,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	7	2	and when the LORD your God delivers them before you and you defeat them, then you shall utterly destroy them. You shall make no covenant with them and show no favor to them.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	7	3	"Furthermore, you shall not intermarry with them; you shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor shall you take their daughters for your sons.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	7	4	"For they will turn your sons away from following Me to serve other gods; then the anger of the LORD will be kindled against you and He will quickly destroy you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	7	5	"But thus you shall do to them: you shall tear down their altars, and smash their sacred pillars, and hew down their Asherim, and burn their graven images with fire.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	7	6	"For you are a holy people to the LORD your God; the LORD your God has chosen you to be a people for His own possession out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	7	7	"The LORD did not set His love on you nor choose you because you were more in number than any of the peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	7	8	but because the LORD loved you and kept the oath which He swore to your forefathers, the LORD brought you out by a mighty hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	7	9	"Know therefore that the LORD your God, He is God, the faithful God, who keeps His covenant and His lovingkindness to a thousandth generation with those who love Him and keep His commandments;
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	7	10	but repays those who hate Him to their faces, to destroy them; He will not delay with him who hates Him, He will repay him to his face.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	7	11	"Therefore, you shall keep the commandment and the statutes and the judgments which I am commanding you today, to do them.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	7	12	"Then it shall come about, because you listen to these judgments and keep and do them, that the LORD your God will keep with you His covenant and His lovingkindness which He swore to your forefathers.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	7	13	"He will love you and bless you and multiply you; He will also bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your ground, your grain and your new wine and your oil, the increase of your herd and the young of your flock, in the land which He swore to your forefathers to give you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	7	14	"You shall be blessed above all peoples; there will be no male or female barren among you or among your cattle.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	7	15	"The LORD will remove from you all sickness; and He will not put on you any of the harmful diseases of Egypt which you have known, but He will lay them on all who hate you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	7	16	"You shall consume all the peoples whom the LORD your God will deliver to you; your eye shall not pity them, nor shall you serve their gods, for that would be a snare to you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	7	17	"If you should say in your heart, 'These nations are greater than I; how can I dispossess them?'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	7	18	you shall not be afraid of them; you shall well remember what the LORD your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt:
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	7	19	the great trials which your eyes saw and the signs and the wonders and the mighty hand and the outstretched arm by which the LORD your God brought you out. So shall the LORD your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	7	20	"Moreover, the LORD your God will send the hornet against them, until those who are left and hide themselves from you perish.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	7	21	"You shall not dread them, for the LORD your God is in your midst, a great and awesome God.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	7	22	"The LORD your God will clear away these nations before you little by little; you will not be able to put an end to them quickly, for the wild beasts would grow too numerous for you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	7	23	"But the LORD your God will deliver them before you, and will throw them into great confusion until they are destroyed.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	7	24	"He will deliver their kings into your hand so that you will make their name perish from under heaven; no man will be able to stand before you until you have destroyed them.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	7	25	"The graven images of their gods you are to burn with fire; you shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it for yourselves, or you will be snared by it, for it is an abomination to the LORD your God.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	7	26	"You shall not bring an abomination into your house, and like it come under the ban; you shall utterly detest it and you shall utterly abhor it, for it is something banned.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	8	1	"All the commandments that I am commanding you today you shall be careful to do, that you may live and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the LORD swore to give to your forefathers.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	8	2	"You shall remember all the way which the LORD your God has led you in the wilderness these forty years, that He might humble you, testing you, to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep His commandments or not.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	8	3	"He humbled you and let you be hungry, and fed you with manna which you did not know, nor did your fathers know, that He might make you understand that man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by everything that proceeds out of the mouth of the LORD.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	8	4	"Your clothing did not wear out on you, nor did your foot swell these forty years.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	8	5	"Thus you are to know in your heart that the LORD your God was disciplining you just as a man disciplines his son.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	8	6	"Therefore, you shall keep the commandments of the LORD your God, to walk in His ways and to fear Him.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	8	7	"For the LORD your God is bringing you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and springs, flowing forth in valleys and hills;
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	8	8	a land of wheat and barley, of vines and fig trees and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey;
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	8	9	a land where you will eat food without scarcity, in which you will not lack anything; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you can dig copper.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	8	10	"When you have eaten and are satisfied, you shall bless the LORD your God for the good land which He has given you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	8	11	"Beware that you do not forget the LORD your God by not keeping His commandments and His ordinances and His statutes which I am commanding you today;
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	8	12	otherwise, when you have eaten and are satisfied, and have built good houses and lived in them,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	8	13	and when your herds and your flocks multiply, and your silver and gold multiply, and all that you have multiplies,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	8	14	then your heart will become proud and you will forget the LORD your God who brought you out from the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	8	15	"He led you through the great and terrible wilderness, with its fiery serpents and scorpions and thirsty ground where there was no water; He brought water for you out of the rock of flint.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	8	16	"In the wilderness He fed you manna which your fathers did not know, that He might humble you and that He might test you, to do good for you in the end.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	8	17	"Otherwise, you may say in your heart, 'My power and the strength of my hand made me this wealth.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	8	18	"But you shall remember the LORD your God, for it is He who is giving you power to make wealth, that He may confirm His covenant which He swore to your fathers, as it is this day.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	8	19	"It shall come about if you ever forget the LORD your God and go after other gods and serve them and worship them, I testify against you today that you will surely perish.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	8	20	"Like the nations that the LORD makes to perish before you, so you shall perish; because you would not listen to the voice of the LORD your God.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	9	1	"Hear, O Israel! You are crossing over the Jordan today to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than you, great cities fortified to heaven,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	9	2	a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom you know and of whom you have heard it said, 'Who can stand before the sons of Anak?'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	9	3	"Know therefore today that it is the LORD your God who is crossing over before you as a consuming fire. He will destroy them and He will subdue them before you, so that you may drive them out and destroy them quickly, just as the LORD has spoken to you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	9	4	"Do not say in your heart when the LORD your God has driven them out before you, 'Because of my righteousness the LORD has brought me in to possess this land,' but it is because of the wickedness of these nations that the LORD is dispossessing them before you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	9	5	"It is not for your righteousness or for the uprightness of your heart that you are going to possess their land, but it is because of the wickedness of these nations that the LORD your God is driving them out before you, in order to confirm the oath which the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	9	6	"Know, then, it is not because of your righteousness that the LORD your God is giving you this good land to possess, for you are a stubborn people.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	9	7	"Remember, do not forget how you provoked the LORD your God to wrath in the wilderness; from the day that you left the land of Egypt until you arrived at this place, you have been rebellious against the LORD.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	9	8	"Even at Horeb you provoked the LORD to wrath, and the LORD was so angry with you that He would have destroyed you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	9	9	"When I went up to the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant which the LORD had made with you, then I remained on the mountain forty days and nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	9	10	"The LORD gave me the two tablets of stone written by the finger of God; and on them were all the words which the LORD had spoken with you at the mountain from the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	9	11	"It came about at the end of forty days and nights that the LORD gave me the two tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	9	12	"Then the LORD said to me, 'Arise, go down from here quickly, for your people whom you brought out of Egypt have acted corruptly. They have quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them; they have made a molten image for themselves.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	9	13	"The LORD spoke further to me, saying, 'I have seen this people, and indeed, it is a stubborn people.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	9	14	'Let Me alone, that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	9	15	"So I turned and came down from the mountain while the mountain was burning with fire, and the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	9	16	"And I saw that you had indeed sinned against the LORD your God. You had made for yourselves a molten calf; you had turned aside quickly from the way which the LORD had commanded you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	9	17	"I took hold of the two tablets and threw them from my hands and smashed them before your eyes.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	9	18	"I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all your sin which you had committed in doing what was evil in the sight of the LORD to provoke Him to anger.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	9	19	"For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure with which the LORD was wrathful against you in order to destroy you, but the LORD listened to me that time also.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	9	20	"The LORD was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him; so I also prayed for Aaron at the same time.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	9	21	"I took your sinful thing, the calf which you had made, and burned it with fire and crushed it, grinding it very small until it was as fine as dust; and I threw its dust into the brook that came down from the mountain.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	9	22	"Again at Taberah and at Massah and at Kibroth-hattaavah you provoked the LORD to wrath.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	9	23	"When the LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, 'Go up and possess the land which I have given you,' then you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God; you neither believed Him nor listened to His voice.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	9	24	"You have been rebellious against the LORD from the day I knew you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	9	25	"So I fell down before the LORD the forty days and nights, which I did because the LORD had said He would destroy you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	9	26	"I prayed to the LORD and said, 'O Lord GOD, do not destroy Your people, even Your inheritance, whom You have redeemed through Your greatness, whom You have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	9	27	'Remember Your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; do not look at the stubbornness of this people or at their wickedness or their sin.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	9	28	'Otherwise the land from which You brought us may say, "Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which He had promised them and because He hated them He has brought them out to slay them in the wilderness."
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	9	29	'Yet they are Your people, even Your inheritance, whom You have brought out by Your great power and Your outstretched arm.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	10	1	"At that time the LORD said to me, 'Cut out for yourself two tablets of stone like the former ones, and come up to Me on the mountain, and make an ark of wood for yourself.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	10	2	'I will write on the tablets the words that were on the former tablets which you shattered, and you shall put them in the ark.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	10	3	"So I made an ark of acacia wood and cut out two tablets of stone like the former ones, and went up on the mountain with the two tablets in my hand.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	10	4	"He wrote on the tablets, like the former writing, the Ten Commandments which the LORD had spoken to you on the mountain from the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly; and the LORD gave them to me.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	10	5	"Then I turned and came down from the mountain and put the tablets in the ark which I had made; and there they are, as the LORD commanded me."
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	10	6	(Now the sons of Israel set out from Beeroth Bene-jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died and there he was buried and Eleazar his son ministered as priest in his place.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	10	7	From there they set out to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	10	8	At that time the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to serve Him and to bless in His name until this day.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	10	9	Therefore, Levi does not have a portion or inheritance with his brothers; the LORD is his inheritance, just as the LORD your God spoke to him.)
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	10	10	"I, moreover, stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights like the first time, and the LORD listened to me that time also; the LORD was not willing to destroy you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	10	11	"Then the LORD said to me, 'Arise, proceed on your journey ahead of the people, that they may go in and possess the land which I swore to their fathers to give them.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	10	12	"Now, Israel, what does the LORD your God require from you, but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all His ways and love Him, and to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	10	13	and to keep the LORD'S commandments and His statutes which I am commanding you today for your good?
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	10	14	"Behold, to the LORD your God belong heaven and the highest heavens, the earth and all that is in it.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	10	15	"Yet on your fathers did the LORD set His affection to love them, and He chose their descendants after them, even you above all peoples, as it is this day.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	10	16	"So circumcise your heart, and stiffen your neck no longer.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	10	17	"For the LORD your God is the God of gods and the Lord of lords, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God who does not show partiality nor take a bribe.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	10	18	"He executes justice for the orphan and the widow, and shows His love for the alien by giving him food and clothing.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	10	19	"So show your love for the alien, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	10	20	"You shall fear the LORD your God; you shall serve Him and cling to Him, and you shall swear by His name.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	10	21	"He is your praise and He is your God, who has done these great and awesome things for you which your eyes have seen.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	10	22	"Your fathers went down to Egypt seventy persons in all, and now the LORD your God has made you as numerous as the stars of heaven.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	11	1	"You shall therefore love the LORD your God, and always keep His charge, His statutes, His ordinances, and His commandments.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	11	2	"Know this day that I am not speaking with your sons who have not known and who have not seen the discipline of the LORD your God--His greatness, His mighty hand and His outstretched arm,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	11	3	and His signs and His works which He did in the midst of Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt and to all his land;
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	11	4	and what He did to Egypt's army, to its horses and its chariots, when He made the water of the Red Sea to engulf them while they were pursuing you, and the LORD completely destroyed them;
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	11	5	and what He did to you in the wilderness until you came to this place;
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	11	6	and what He did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben, when the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, their households, their tents, and every living thing that followed them, among all Israel--
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	11	7	but your own eyes have seen all the great work of the LORD which He did.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	11	8	"You shall therefore keep every commandment which I am commanding you today, so that you may be strong and go in and possess the land into which you are about to cross to possess it;
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	11	9	so that you may prolong your days on the land which the LORD swore to your fathers to give to them and to their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	11	10	"For the land, into which you are entering to possess it, is not like the land of Egypt from which you came, where you used to sow your seed and water it with your foot like a vegetable garden.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	11	11	"But the land into which you are about to cross to possess it, a land of hills and valleys, drinks water from the rain of heaven,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	11	12	a land for which the LORD your God cares; the eyes of the LORD your God are always on it, from the beginning even to the end of the year.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	11	13	"It shall come about, if you listen obediently to my commandments which I am commanding you today, to love the LORD your God and to serve Him with all your heart and all your soul,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	11	14	that He will give the rain for your land in its season, the early and late rain, that you may gather in your grain and your new wine and your oil.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	11	15	"He will give grass in your fields for your cattle, and you will eat and be satisfied.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	11	16	"Beware that your hearts are not deceived, and that you do not turn away and serve other gods and worship them.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	11	17	"Or the anger of the LORD will be kindled against you, and He will shut up the heavens so that there will be no rain and the ground will not yield its fruit; and you will perish quickly from the good land which the LORD is giving you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	11	18	"You shall therefore impress these words of mine on your heart and on your soul; and you shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontals on your forehead.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	11	19	"You shall teach them to your sons, talking of them when you sit in your house and when you walk along the road and when you lie down and when you rise up.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	11	20	"You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	11	21	so that your days and the days of your sons may be multiplied on the land which the LORD swore to your fathers to give them, as long as the heavens remain above the earth.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	11	22	"For if you are careful to keep all this commandment which I am commanding you to do, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all His ways and hold fast to Him,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	11	23	then the LORD will drive out all these nations from before you, and you will dispossess nations greater and mightier than you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	11	24	"Every place on which the sole of your foot treads shall be yours; your border will be from the wilderness to Lebanon, and from the river, the river Euphrates, as far as the western sea.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	11	25	"No man will be able to stand before you; the LORD your God will lay the dread of you and the fear of you on all the land on which you set foot, as He has spoken to you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	11	26	"See, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse:
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	11	27	the blessing, if you listen to the commandments of the LORD your God, which I am commanding you today;
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	11	28	and the curse, if you do not listen to the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside from the way which I am commanding you today, by following other gods which you have not known.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	11	29	"It shall come about, when the LORD your God brings you into the land where you are entering to possess it, that you shall place the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	11	30	"Are they not across the Jordan, west of the way toward the sunset, in the land of the Canaanites who live in the Arabah, opposite Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh?
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	11	31	"For you are about to cross the Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God is giving you, and you shall possess it and live in it,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	11	32	and you shall be careful to do all the statutes and the judgments which I am setting before you today.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	12	1	"These are the statutes and the judgments which you shall carefully observe in the land which the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you to possess as long as you live on the earth.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	12	2	"You shall utterly destroy all the places where the nations whom you shall dispossess serve their gods, on the high mountains and on the hills and under every green tree.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	12	3	"You shall tear down their altars and smash their sacred pillars and burn their Asherim with fire, and you shall cut down the engraved images of their gods and obliterate their name from that place.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	12	4	"You shall not act like this toward the LORD your God.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	12	5	"But you shall seek the LORD at the place which the LORD your God will choose from all your tribes, to establish His name there for His dwelling, and there you shall come.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	12	6	"There you shall bring your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the contribution of your hand, your votive offerings, your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	12	7	"There also you and your households shall eat before the LORD your God, and rejoice in all your undertakings in which the LORD your God has blessed you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	12	8	"You shall not do at all what we are doing here today, every man doing whatever is right in his own eyes;
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	12	9	for you have not as yet come to the resting place and the inheritance which the LORD your God is giving you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	12	10	"When you cross the Jordan and live in the land which the LORD your God is giving you to inherit, and He gives you rest from all your enemies around you so that you live in security,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	12	11	then it shall come about that the place in which the LORD your God will choose for His name to dwell, there you shall bring all that I command you: your burnt offerings and your sacrifices, your tithes and the contribution of your hand, and all your choice votive offerings which you will vow to the LORD.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	12	12	"And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you and your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levite who is within your gates, since he has no portion or inheritance with you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	12	13	"Be careful that you do not offer your burnt offerings in every cultic place you see,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	12	14	but in the place which the LORD chooses in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do all that I command you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	12	15	"However, you may slaughter and eat meat within any of your gates, whatever you desire, according to the blessing of the LORD your God which He has given you; the unclean and the clean may eat of it, as of the gazelle and the deer.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	12	16	"Only you shall not eat the blood; you are to pour it out on the ground like water.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	12	17	"You are not allowed to eat within your gates the tithe of your grain or new wine or oil, or the firstborn of your herd or flock, or any of your votive offerings which you vow, or your freewill offerings, or the contribution of your hand.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	12	18	"But you shall eat them before the LORD your God in the place which the LORD your God will choose, you and your son and daughter, and your male and female servants, and the Levite who is within your gates; and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God in all your undertakings.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	12	19	"Be careful that you do not forsake the Levite as long as you live in your land.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	12	20	"When the LORD your God extends your border as He has promised you, and you say, 'I will eat meat,' because you desire to eat meat, then you may eat meat, whatever you desire.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	12	21	"If the place which the LORD your God chooses to put His name is too far from you, then you may slaughter of your herd and flock which the LORD has given you, as I have commanded you; and you may eat within your gates whatever you desire.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	12	22	"Just as a gazelle or a deer is eaten, so you will eat it; the unclean and the clean alike may eat of it.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	12	23	"Only be sure not to eat the blood, for the blood is the life, and you shall not eat the life with the flesh.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	12	24	"You shall not eat it; you shall pour it out on the ground like water.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	12	25	"You shall not eat it, so that it may be well with you and your sons after you, for you will be doing what is right in the sight of the LORD.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	12	26	"Only your holy things which you may have and your votive offerings, you shall take and go to the place which the LORD chooses.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	12	27	"And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, on the altar of the LORD your God; and the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on the altar of the LORD your God, and you shall eat the flesh.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	12	28	"Be careful to listen to all these words which I command you, so that it may be well with you and your sons after you forever, for you will be doing what is good and right in the sight of the LORD your God.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	12	29	"When the LORD your God cuts off before you the nations which you are going in to dispossess, and you dispossess them and dwell in their land,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	12	30	beware that you are not ensnared to follow them, after they are destroyed before you, and that you do not inquire after their gods, saying, 'How do these nations serve their gods, that I also may do likewise?'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	12	31	"You shall not behave thus toward the LORD your God, for every abominable act which the LORD hates they have done for their gods; for they even burn their sons and daughters in the fire to their gods.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	12	32	"Whatever I command you, you shall be careful to do; you shall not add to nor take away from it.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	13	1	"If a prophet or a dreamer of dreams arises among you and gives you a sign or a wonder,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	13	2	and the sign or the wonder comes true, concerning which he spoke to you, saying, 'Let us go after other gods (whom you have not known) and let us serve them,'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	13	3	you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams; for the LORD your God is testing you to find out if you love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	13	4	"You shall follow the LORD your God and fear Him; and you shall keep His commandments, listen to His voice, serve Him, and cling to Him.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	13	5	"But that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death, because he has counseled rebellion against the LORD your God who brought you from the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the house of slavery, to seduce you from the way in which the LORD your God commanded you to walk. So you shall purge the evil from among you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	13	6	"If your brother, your mother's son, or your son or daughter, or the wife you cherish, or your friend who is as your own soul, entice you secretly, saying, 'Let us go and serve other gods' (whom neither you nor your fathers have known,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	13	7	of the gods of the peoples who are around you, near you or far from you, from one end of the earth to the other end),
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	13	8	you shall not yield to him or listen to him; and your eye shall not pity him, nor shall you spare or conceal him.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	13	9	"But you shall surely kill him; your hand shall be first against him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	13	10	"So you shall stone him to death because he has sought to seduce you from the LORD your God who brought you out from the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	13	11	"Then all Israel will hear and be afraid, and will never again do such a wicked thing among you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	13	12	"If you hear in one of your cities, which the LORD your God is giving you to live in, anyone saying that
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	13	13	some worthless men have gone out from among you and have seduced the inhabitants of their city, saying, 'Let us go and serve other gods' (whom you have not known),
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	13	14	then you shall investigate and search out and inquire thoroughly. If it is true and the matter established that this abomination has been done among you,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	13	15	you shall surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying it and all that is in it and its cattle with the edge of the sword.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	13	16	"Then you shall gather all its booty into the middle of its open square and burn the city and all its booty with fire as a whole burnt offering to the LORD your God; and it shall be a ruin forever. It shall never be rebuilt.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	13	17	"Nothing from that which is put under the ban shall cling to your hand, in order that the LORD may turn from His burning anger and show mercy to you, and have compassion on you and make you increase, just as He has sworn to your fathers,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	13	18	if you will listen to the voice of the LORD your God, keeping all His commandments which I am commanding you today, and doing what is right in the sight of the LORD your God.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	14	1	"You are the sons of the LORD your God; you shall not cut yourselves nor shave your forehead for the sake of the dead.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	14	2	"For you are a holy people to the LORD your God, and the LORD has chosen you to be a people for His own possession out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	14	3	"You shall not eat any detestable thing.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	14	4	"These are the animals which you may eat: the ox, the sheep, the goat,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	14	5	the deer, the gazelle, the roebuck, the wild goat, the ibex, the antelope and the mountain sheep.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	14	6	"Any animal that divides the hoof and has the hoof split in two and chews the cud, among the animals, that you may eat.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	14	7	"Nevertheless, you are not to eat of these among those which chew the cud, or among those that divide the hoof in two: the camel and the rabbit and the shaphan, for though they chew the cud, they do not divide the hoof; they are unclean for you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	14	8	"The pig, because it divides the hoof but does not chew the cud, it is unclean for you. You shall not eat any of their flesh nor touch their carcasses.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	14	9	"These you may eat of all that are in water: anything that has fins and scales you may eat,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	14	10	but anything that does not have fins and scales you shall not eat; it is unclean for you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	14	11	"You may eat any clean bird.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	14	12	"But these are the ones which you shall not eat: the eagle and the vulture and the buzzard,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	14	13	and the red kite, the falcon, and the kite in their kinds,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	14	14	and every raven in its kind,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	14	15	and the ostrich, the owl, the sea gull, and the hawk in their kinds,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	14	16	the little owl, the great owl, the white owl,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	14	17	the pelican, the carrion vulture, the cormorant,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	14	18	the stork, and the heron in their kinds, and the hoopoe and the bat.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	14	19	"And all the teeming life with wings are unclean to you; they shall not be eaten.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	14	20	"You may eat any clean bird.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	14	21	"You shall not eat anything which dies of itself. You may give it to the alien who is in your town, so that he may eat it, or you may sell it to a foreigner, for you are a holy people to the LORD your God. You shall not boil a young goat in its mother's milk.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	14	22	"You shall surely tithe all the produce from what you sow, which comes out of the field every year.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	14	23	"You shall eat in the presence of the LORD your God, at the place where He chooses to establish His name, the tithe of your grain, your new wine, your oil, and the firstborn of your herd and your flock, so that you may learn to fear the LORD your God always.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	14	24	"If the distance is so great for you that you are not able to bring the tithe, since the place where the LORD your God chooses to set His name is too far away from you when the LORD your God blesses you,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	14	25	then you shall exchange it for money, and bind the money in your hand and go to the place which the LORD your God chooses.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	14	26	"You may spend the money for whatever your heart desires: for oxen, or sheep, or wine, or strong drink, or whatever your heart desires; and there you shall eat in the presence of the LORD your God and rejoice, you and your household.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	14	27	"Also you shall not neglect the Levite who is in your town, for he has no portion or inheritance among you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	14	28	"At the end of every third year you shall bring out all the tithe of your produce in that year, and shall deposit it in your town.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	14	29	"The Levite, because he has no portion or inheritance among you, and the alien, the orphan and the widow who are in your town, shall come and eat and be satisfied, in order that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hand which you do.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	15	1	"At the end of every seven years you shall grant a remission of debts.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	15	2	"This is the manner of remission: every creditor shall release what he has loaned to his neighbor; he shall not exact it of his neighbor and his brother, because the LORD'S remission has been proclaimed.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	15	3	"From a foreigner you may exact it, but your hand shall release whatever of yours is with your brother.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	15	4	"However, there will be no poor among you, since the LORD will surely bless you in the land which the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance to possess,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	15	5	if only you listen obediently to the voice of the LORD your God, to observe carefully all this commandment which I am commanding you today.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	15	6	"For the LORD your God will bless you as He has promised you, and you will lend to many nations, but you will not borrow; and you will rule over many nations, but they will not rule over you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	15	7	"If there is a poor man with you, one of your brothers, in any of your towns in your land which the LORD your God is giving you, you shall not harden your heart, nor close your hand from your poor brother;
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	15	8	but you shall freely open your hand to him, and shall generously lend him sufficient for his need in whatever he lacks.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	15	9	"Beware that there is no base thought in your heart, saying, 'The seventh year, the year of remission, is near,' and your eye is hostile toward your poor brother, and you give him nothing; then he may cry to the LORD against you, and it will be a sin in you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	15	10	"You shall generously give to him, and your heart shall not be grieved when you give to him, because for this thing the LORD your God will bless you in all your work and in all your undertakings.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	15	11	"For the poor will never cease to be in the land; therefore I command you, saying, 'You shall freely open your hand to your brother, to your needy and poor in your land.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	15	12	"If your kinsman, a Hebrew man or woman, is sold to you, then he shall serve you six years, but in the seventh year you shall set him free.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	15	13	"When you set him free, you shall not send him away empty-handed.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	15	14	"You shall furnish him liberally from your flock and from your threshing floor and from your wine vat; you shall give to him as the LORD your God has blessed you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	15	15	"You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God redeemed you; therefore I command you this today.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	15	16	"It shall come about if he says to you, 'I will not go out from you,' because he loves you and your household, since he fares well with you;
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	15	17	then you shall take an awl and pierce it through his ear into the door, and he shall be your servant forever. Also you shall do likewise to your maidservant.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	15	18	"It shall not seem hard to you when you set him free, for he has given you six years with double the service of a hired man; so the LORD your God will bless you in whatever you do.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	15	19	"You shall consecrate to the LORD your God all the firstborn males that are born of your herd and of your flock; you shall not work with the firstborn of your herd, nor shear the firstborn of your flock.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	15	20	"You and your household shall eat it every year before the LORD your God in the place which the LORD chooses.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	15	21	"But if it has any defect, such as lameness or blindness, or any serious defect, you shall not sacrifice it to the LORD your God.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	15	22	"You shall eat it within your gates; the unclean and the clean alike may eat it, as a gazelle or a deer.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	15	23	"Only you shall not eat its blood; you are to pour it out on the ground like water.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	16	1	"Observe the month of Abib and celebrate the Passover to the LORD your God, for in the month of Abib the LORD your God brought you out of Egypt by night.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	16	2	"You shall sacrifice the Passover to the LORD your God from the flock and the herd, in the place where the LORD chooses to establish His name.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	16	3	"You shall not eat leavened bread with it; seven days you shall eat with it unleavened bread, the bread of affliction (for you came out of the land of Egypt in haste), so that you may remember all the days of your life the day when you came out of the land of Egypt.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	16	4	"For seven days no leaven shall be seen with you in all your territory, and none of the flesh which you sacrifice on the evening of the first day shall remain overnight until morning.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	16	5	"You are not allowed to sacrifice the Passover in any of your towns which the LORD your God is giving you;
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	16	6	but at the place where the LORD your God chooses to establish His name, you shall sacrifice the Passover in the evening at sunset, at the time that you came out of Egypt.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	16	7	"You shall cook and eat it in the place which the LORD your God chooses. In the morning you are to return to your tents.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	16	8	"Six days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a solemn assembly to the LORD your God; you shall do no work on it.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	16	9	"You shall count seven weeks for yourself; you shall begin to count seven weeks from the time you begin to put the sickle to the standing grain.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	16	10	"Then you shall celebrate the Feast of Weeks to the LORD your God with a tribute of a freewill offering of your hand, which you shall give just as the LORD your God blesses you;
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	16	11	and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you and your son and your daughter and your male and female servants and the Levite who is in your town, and the stranger and the orphan and the widow who are in your midst, in the place where the LORD your God chooses to establish His name.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	16	12	"You shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and you shall be careful to observe these statutes.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	16	13	"You shall celebrate the Feast of Booths seven days after you have gathered in from your threshing floor and your wine vat;
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	16	14	and you shall rejoice in your feast, you and your son and your daughter and your male and female servants and the Levite and the stranger and the orphan and the widow who are in your towns.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	16	15	"Seven days you shall celebrate a feast to the LORD your God in the place which the LORD chooses, because the LORD your God will bless you in all your produce and in all the work of your hands, so that you will be altogether joyful.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	16	16	"Three times in a year all your males shall appear before the LORD your God in the place which He chooses, at the Feast of Unleavened Bread and at the Feast of Weeks and at the Feast of Booths, and they shall not appear before the LORD empty-handed.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	16	17	"Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the LORD your God which He has given you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	16	18	"You shall appoint for yourself judges and officers in all your towns which the LORD your God is giving you, according to your tribes, and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	16	19	"You shall not distort justice; you shall not be partial, and you shall not take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and perverts the words of the righteous.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	16	20	"Justice, and only justice, you shall pursue, that you may live and possess the land which the LORD your God is giving you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	16	21	"You shall not plant for yourself an Asherah of any kind of tree beside the altar of the LORD your God, which you shall make for yourself.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	16	22	"You shall not set up for yourself a sacred pillar which the LORD your God hates.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	17	1	"You shall not sacrifice to the LORD your God an ox or a sheep which has a blemish or any defect, for that is a detestable thing to the LORD your God.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	17	2	"If there is found in your midst, in any of your towns, which the LORD your God is giving you, a man or a woman who does what is evil in the sight of the LORD your God, by transgressing His covenant,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	17	3	and has gone and served other gods and worshiped them, or the sun or the moon or any of the heavenly host, which I have not commanded,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	17	4	and if it is told you and you have heard of it, then you shall inquire thoroughly. Behold, if it is true and the thing certain that this detestable thing has been done in Israel,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	17	5	then you shall bring out that man or that woman who has done this evil deed to your gates, that is, the man or the woman, and you shall stone them to death.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	17	6	"On the evidence of two witnesses or three witnesses, he who is to die shall be put to death; he shall not be put to death on the evidence of one witness.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	17	7	"The hand of the witnesses shall be first against him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people. So you shall purge the evil from your midst.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	17	8	"If any case is too difficult for you to decide, between one kind of homicide or another, between one kind of lawsuit or another, and between one kind of assault or another, being cases of dispute in your courts, then you shall arise and go up to the place which the LORD your God chooses.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	17	9	"So you shall come to the Levitical priest or the judge who is in office in those days, and you shall inquire of them and they will declare to you the verdict in the case.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	17	10	"You shall do according to the terms of the verdict which they declare to you from that place which the LORD chooses; and you shall be careful to observe according to all that they teach you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	17	11	"According to the terms of the law which they teach you, and according to the verdict which they tell you, you shall do; you shall not turn aside from the word which they declare to you, to the right or the left.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	17	12	"The man who acts presumptuously by not listening to the priest who stands there to serve the LORD your God, nor to the judge, that man shall die; thus you shall purge the evil from Israel.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	17	13	"Then all the people will hear and be afraid, and will not act presumptuously again.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	17	14	"When you enter the land which the LORD your God gives you, and you possess it and live in it, and you say, 'I will set a king over me like all the nations who are around me,'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	17	15	you shall surely set a king over you whom the LORD your God chooses, one from among your countrymen you shall set as king over yourselves; you may not put a foreigner over yourselves who is not your countryman.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	17	16	"Moreover, he shall not multiply horses for himself, nor shall he cause the people to return to Egypt to multiply horses, since the LORD has said to you, 'You shall never again return that way.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	17	17	"He shall not multiply wives for himself, or else his heart will turn away; nor shall he greatly increase silver and gold for himself.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	17	18	"Now it shall come about when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, he shall write for himself a copy of this law on a scroll in the presence of the Levitical priests.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	17	19	"It shall be with him and he shall read it all the days of his life, that he may learn to fear the LORD his God, by carefully observing all the words of this law and these statutes,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	17	20	that his heart may not be lifted up above his countrymen and that he may not turn aside from the commandment, to the right or the left, so that he and his sons may continue long in his kingdom in the midst of Israel.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	18	1	"The Levitical priests, the whole tribe of Levi, shall have no portion or inheritance with Israel; they shall eat the LORD'S offerings by fire and His portion.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	18	2	"They shall have no inheritance among their countrymen; the LORD is their inheritance, as He promised them.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	18	3	"Now this shall be the priests' due from the people, from those who offer a sacrifice, either an ox or a sheep, of which they shall give to the priest the shoulder and the two cheeks and the stomach.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	18	4	"You shall give him the first fruits of your grain, your new wine, and your oil, and the first shearing of your sheep.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	18	5	"For the LORD your God has chosen him and his sons from all your tribes, to stand and serve in the name of the LORD forever.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	18	6	"Now if a Levite comes from any of your towns throughout Israel where he resides, and comes whenever he desires to the place which the LORD chooses,

Deuteronomy	Deu	5	18	8	"They shall eat equal portions, except what they receive from the sale of their fathers' estates.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	18	9	"When you enter the land which the LORD your God gives you, you shall not learn to imitate the detestable things of those nations.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	18	10	"There shall not be found among you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire, one who uses divination, one who practices witchcraft, or one who interprets omens, or a sorcerer,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	18	11	or one who casts a spell, or a medium, or a spiritist, or one who calls up the dead.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	18	12	"For whoever does these things is detestable to the LORD; and because of these detestable things the LORD your God will drive them out before you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	18	13	"You shall be blameless before the LORD your God.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	18	14	"For those nations, which you shall dispossess, listen to those who practice witchcraft and to diviners, but as for you, the LORD your God has not allowed you to do so.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	18	15	"The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your countrymen, you shall listen to him.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	18	16	"This is according to all that you asked of the LORD your God in Horeb on the day of the assembly, saying, 'Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, let me not see this great fire anymore, or I will die.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	18	17	"The LORD said to me, 'They have spoken well.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	18	18	'I will raise up a prophet from among their countrymen like you, and I will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	18	19	'It shall come about that whoever will not listen to My words which he shall speak in My name, I Myself will require it of him.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	18	20	'But the prophet who speaks a word presumptuously in My name which I have not commanded him to speak, or which he speaks in the name of other gods, that prophet shall die.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	18	21	"You may say in your heart, 'How will we know the word which the LORD has not spoken?'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	18	22	"When a prophet speaks in the name of the LORD, if the thing does not come about or come true, that is the thing which the LORD has not spoken. The prophet has spoken it presumptuously; you shall not be afraid of him.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	19	1	"When the LORD your God cuts off the nations, whose land the LORD your God gives you, and you dispossess them and settle in their cities and in their houses,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	19	2	you shall set aside three cities for yourself in the midst of your land, which the LORD your God gives you to possess.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	19	3	"You shall prepare the roads for yourself, and divide into three parts the territory of your land which the LORD your God will give you as a possession, so that any manslayer may flee there.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	19	4	"Now this is the case of the manslayer who may flee there and live: when he kills his friend unintentionally, not hating him previously--
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	19	5	as when a man goes into the forest with his friend to cut wood, and his hand swings the axe to cut down the tree, and the iron head slips off the handle and strikes his friend so that he dies--he may flee to one of these cities and live;
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	19	6	otherwise the avenger of blood might pursue the manslayer in the heat of his anger, and overtake him, because the way is long, and take his life, though he was not deserving of death, since he had not hated him previously.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	19	7	"Therefore, I command you, saying, 'You shall set aside three cities for yourself.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	19	8	"If the LORD your God enlarges your territory, just as He has sworn to your fathers, and gives you all the land which He promised to give your fathers--
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	19	9	if you carefully observe all this commandment which I command you today, to love the LORD your God, and to walk in His ways always--then you shall add three more cities for yourself, besides these three.

Deuteronomy	Deu	5	19	16	"If a malicious witness rises up against a man to accuse him of wrongdoing,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	19	17	then both the men who have the dispute shall stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges who will be in office in those days.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	19	18	"The judges shall investigate thoroughly, and if the witness is a false witness and he has accused his brother falsely,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	19	19	then you shall do to him just as he had intended to do to his brother. Thus you shall purge the evil from among you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	19	20	"The rest will hear and be afraid, and will never again do such an evil thing among you.

Deuteronomy	Deu	5	20	19	"When you besiege a city a long time, to make war against it in order to capture it, you shall not destroy its trees by swinging an axe against them; for you may eat from them, and you shall not cut them down. For is the tree of the field a man, that it should be besieged by you?
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	20	20	"Only the trees which you know are not fruit trees you shall destroy and cut down, that you may construct siegeworks against the city that is making war with you until it falls.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	21	1	"If a slain person is found lying in the open country in the land which the LORD your God gives you to possess, and it is not known who has struck him,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	21	2	then your elders and your judges shall go out and measure the distance to the cities which are around the slain one.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	21	3	"It shall be that the city which is nearest to the slain man, that is, the elders of that city, shall take a heifer of the herd, which has not been worked and which has not pulled in a yoke;
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	21	4	and the elders of that city shall bring the heifer down to a valley with running water, which has not been plowed or sown, and shall break the heifer's neck there in the valley.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	21	5	"Then the priests, the sons of Levi, shall come near, for the LORD your God has chosen them to serve Him and to bless in the name of the LORD; and every dispute and every assault shall be settled by them.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	21	6	"All the elders of that city which is nearest to the slain man shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley;
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	21	7	and they shall answer and say, 'Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did our eyes see it.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	21	8	'Forgive Your people Israel whom You have redeemed, O LORD, and do not place the guilt of innocent blood in the midst of Your people Israel.' And the bloodguiltiness shall be forgiven them.

Deuteronomy	Deu	5	21	15	"If a man has two wives, the one loved and the other unloved, and both the loved and the unloved have borne him sons, if the firstborn son belongs to the unloved,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	21	16	then it shall be in the day he wills what he has to his sons, he cannot make the son of the loved the firstborn before the son of the unloved, who is the firstborn.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	21	17	"But he shall acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the unloved, by giving him a double portion of all that he has, for he is the beginning of his strength; to him belongs the right of the firstborn.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	21	18	"If any man has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey his father or his mother, and when they chastise him, he will not even listen to them,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	21	19	then his father and mother shall seize him, and bring him out to the elders of his city at the gateway of his hometown.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	21	20	"They shall say to the elders of his city, 'This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey us, he is a glutton and a drunkard.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	21	21	"Then all the men of his city shall stone him to death; so you shall remove the evil from your midst, and all Israel will hear of it and fear.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	21	22	"If a man has committed a sin worthy of death and he is put to death, and you hang him on a tree,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	21	23	his corpse shall not hang all night on the tree, but you shall surely bury him on the same day (for he who is hanged is accursed of God), so that you do not defile your land which the LORD your God gives you as an inheritance.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	22	1	"You shall not see your countryman's ox or his sheep straying away, and pay no attention to them; you shall certainly bring them back to your countryman.

Deuteronomy	Deu	5	22	3	"Thus you shall do with his donkey, and you shall do the same with his garment, and you shall do likewise with anything lost by your countryman, which he has lost and you have found. You are not allowed to neglect them.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	22	4	"You shall not see your countryman's donkey or his ox fallen down on the way, and pay no attention to them; you shall certainly help him to raise them up.

Deuteronomy	Deu	5	22	14	and charges her with shameful deeds and publicly defames her, and says, 'I took this woman, but when I came near her, I did not find her a virgin,'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	22	15	then the girl's father and her mother shall take and bring out the evidence of the girl's virginity to the elders of the city at the gate.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	22	16	"The girl's father shall say to the elders, 'I gave my daughter to this man for a wife, but he turned against her;
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	22	17	and behold, he has charged her with shameful deeds, saying, "I did not find your daughter a virgin." But this is the evidence of my daughter's virginity.' And they shall spread the garment before the elders of the city.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	22	18	"So the elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	22	19	and they shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver and give it to the girl's father, because he publicly defamed a virgin of Israel. And she shall remain his wife; he cannot divorce her all his days.

Deuteronomy	Deu	5	22	21	then they shall bring out the girl to the doorway of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her to death because she has committed an act of folly in Israel by playing the harlot in her father's house; thus you shall purge the evil from among you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	22	22	"If a man is found lying with a married woman, then both of them shall die, the man who lay with the woman, and the woman; thus you shall purge the evil from Israel.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	22	23	"If there is a girl who is a virgin engaged to a man, and another man finds her in the city and lies with her,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	22	24	then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city and you shall stone them to death; the girl, because she did not cry out in the city, and the man, because he has violated his neighbor's wife. Thus you shall purge the evil from among you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	22	25	"But if in the field the man finds the girl who is engaged, and the man forces her and lies with her, then only the man who lies with her shall die.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	22	26	"But you shall do nothing to the girl; there is no sin in the girl worthy of death, for just as a man rises against his neighbor and murders him, so is this case.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	22	27	"When he found her in the field, the engaged girl cried out, but there was no one to save her.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	22	28	"If a man finds a girl who is a virgin, who is not engaged, and seizes her and lies with her and they are discovered,

Deuteronomy	Deu	5	23	3	"No Ammonite or Moabite shall enter the assembly of the LORD; none of their descendants, even to the tenth generation, shall ever enter the assembly of the LORD,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	23	4	because they did not meet you with food and water on the way when you came out of Egypt, and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	23	5	"Nevertheless, the LORD your God was not willing to listen to Balaam, but the LORD your God turned the curse into a blessing for you because the LORD your God loves you.

Deuteronomy	Deu	5	26	13	"You shall say before the LORD your God, 'I have removed the sacred portion from my house, and also have given it to the Levite and the alien, the orphan and the widow, according to all Your commandments which You have commanded me; I have not transgressed or forgotten any of Your commandments.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	26	14	'I have not eaten of it while mourning, nor have I removed any of it while I was unclean, nor offered any of it to the dead. I have listened to the voice of the LORD my God; I have done according to all that You have commanded me.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	26	15	'Look down from Your holy habitation, from heaven, and bless Your people Israel, and the ground which You have given us, a land flowing with milk and honey, as You swore to our fathers.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	26	16	"This day the LORD your God commands you to do these statutes and ordinances. You shall therefore be careful to do them with all your heart and with all your soul.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	26	17	"You have today declared the LORD to be your God, and that you would walk in His ways and keep His statutes, His commandments and His ordinances, and listen to His voice.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	26	18	"The LORD has today declared you to be His people, a treasured possession, as He promised you, and that you should keep all His commandments;
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	26	19	and that He will set you high above all nations which He has made, for praise, fame, and honor; and that you shall be a consecrated people to the LORD your God, as He has spoken."
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	27	1	Then Moses and the elders of Israel charged the people, saying, "Keep all the commandments which I command you today.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	27	2	"So it shall be on the day when you cross the Jordan to the land which the LORD your God gives you, that you shall set up for yourself large stones and coat them with lime
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	27	3	and write on them all the words of this law, when you cross over, so that you may enter the land which the LORD your God gives you, a land flowing with milk and honey, as the LORD, the God of your fathers, promised you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	27	4	"So it shall be when you cross the Jordan, you shall set up on Mount Ebal, these stones, as I am commanding you today, and you shall coat them with lime.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	27	5	"Moreover, you shall build there an altar to the LORD your God, an altar of stones; you shall not wield an iron tool on them.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	27	6	"You shall build the altar of the LORD your God of uncut stones, and you shall offer on it burnt offerings to the LORD your God;
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	27	7	and you shall sacrifice peace offerings and eat there, and rejoice before the LORD your God.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	27	8	"You shall write on the stones all the words of this law very distinctly."
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	27	9	Then Moses and the Levitical priests spoke to all Israel, saying, "Be silent and listen, O Israel! This day you have become a people for the LORD your God.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	27	10	"You shall therefore obey the LORD your God, and do His commandments and His statutes which I command you today."
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	27	11	Moses also charged the people on that day, saying,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	27	12	"When you cross the Jordan, these shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	27	13	"For the curse, these shall stand on Mount Ebal: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	27	14	"The Levites shall then answer and say to all the men of Israel with a loud voice,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	27	15	'Cursed is the man who makes an idol or a molten image, an abomination to the LORD, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and sets it up in secret.' And all the people shall answer and say, 'Amen.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	27	16	'Cursed is he who dishonors his father or mother.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	27	17	'Cursed is he who moves his neighbor's boundary mark.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	27	18	'Cursed is he who misleads a blind person on the road.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	27	19	'Cursed is he who distorts the justice due an alien, orphan, and widow.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	27	20	'Cursed is he who lies with his father's wife, because he has uncovered his father's skirt.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	27	21	'Cursed is he who lies with any animal.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	27	22	'Cursed is he who lies with his sister, the daughter of his father or of his mother.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	27	23	'Cursed is he who lies with his mother-in-law.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	27	24	'Cursed is he who strikes his neighbor in secret.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	27	25	'Cursed is he who accepts a bribe to strike down an innocent person.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	27	26	'Cursed is he who does not confirm the words of this law by doing them.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	1	"Now it shall be, if you diligently obey the LORD your God, being careful to do all His commandments which I command you today, the LORD your God will set you high above all the nations of the earth.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	2	"All these blessings will come upon you and overtake you if you obey the LORD your God:
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	3	"Blessed shall you be in the city, and blessed shall you be in the country.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	4	"Blessed shall be the offspring of your body and the produce of your ground and the offspring of your beasts, the increase of your herd and the young of your flock.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	5	"Blessed shall be your basket and your kneading bowl.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	6	"Blessed shall you be when you come in, and blessed shall you be when you go out.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	7	"The LORD shall cause your enemies who rise up against you to be defeated before you; they will come out against you one way and will flee before you seven ways.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	8	"The LORD will command the blessing upon you in your barns and in all that you put your hand to, and He will bless you in the land which the LORD your God gives you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	9	"The LORD will establish you as a holy people to Himself, as He swore to you, if you keep the commandments of the LORD your God and walk in His ways.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	10	"So all the peoples of the earth will see that you are called by the name of the LORD, and they will be afraid of you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	11	"The LORD will make you abound in prosperity, in the offspring of your body and in the offspring of your beast and in the produce of your ground, in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers to give you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	12	"The LORD will open for you His good storehouse, the heavens, to give rain to your land in its season and to bless all the work of your hand; and you shall lend to many nations, but you shall not borrow.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	13	"The LORD will make you the head and not the tail, and you only will be above, and you will not be underneath, if you listen to the commandments of the LORD your God, which I charge you today, to observe them carefully,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	14	and do not turn aside from any of the words which I command you today, to the right or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	15	"But it shall come about, if you do not obey the LORD your God, to observe to do all His commandments and His statutes with which I charge you today, that all these curses will come upon you and overtake you:
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	16	"Cursed shall you be in the city, and cursed shall you be in the country.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	17	"Cursed shall be your basket and your kneading bowl.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	18	"Cursed shall be the offspring of your body and the produce of your ground, the increase of your herd and the young of your flock.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	19	"Cursed shall you be when you come in, and cursed shall you be when you go out.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	20	"The LORD will send upon you curses, confusion, and rebuke, in all you undertake to do, until you are destroyed and until you perish quickly, on account of the evil of your deeds, because you have forsaken Me.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	21	"The LORD will make the pestilence cling to you until He has consumed you from the land where you are entering to possess it.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	22	"The LORD will smite you with consumption and with fever and with inflammation and with fiery heat and with the sword and with blight and with mildew, and they will pursue you until you perish.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	23	"The heaven which is over your head shall be bronze, and the earth which is under you, iron.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	24	"The LORD will make the rain of your land powder and dust; from heaven it shall come down on you until you are destroyed.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	25	"The LORD shall cause you to be defeated before your enemies; you will go out one way against them, but you will flee seven ways before them, and you will be an example of terror to all the kingdoms of the earth.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	26	"Your carcasses will be food to all birds of the sky and to the beasts of the earth, and there will be no one to frighten them away.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	27	"The LORD will smite you with the boils of Egypt and with tumors and with the scab and with the itch, from which you cannot be healed.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	28	"The LORD will smite you with madness and with blindness and with bewilderment of heart;
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	29	and you will grope at noon, as the blind man gropes in darkness, and you will not prosper in your ways; but you shall only be oppressed and robbed continually, with none to save you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	30	"You shall betroth a wife, but another man will violate her; you shall build a house, but you will not live in it; you shall plant a vineyard, but you will not use its fruit.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	31	"Your ox shall be slaughtered before your eyes, but you will not eat of it; your donkey shall be torn away from you, and will not be restored to you; your sheep shall be given to your enemies, and you will have none to save you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	32	"Your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people, while your eyes look on and yearn for them continually; but there will be nothing you can do.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	33	"A people whom you do not know shall eat up the produce of your ground and all your labors, and you will never be anything but oppressed and crushed continually.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	34	"You shall be driven mad by the sight of what you see.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	35	"The LORD will strike you on the knees and legs with sore boils, from which you cannot be healed, from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	36	"The LORD will bring you and your king, whom you set over you, to a nation which neither you nor your fathers have known, and there you shall serve other gods, wood and stone.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	37	"You shall become a horror, a proverb, and a taunt among all the people where the LORD drives you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	38	"You shall bring out much seed to the field but you will gather in little, for the locust will consume it.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	39	"You shall plant and cultivate vineyards, but you will neither drink of the wine nor gather the grapes, for the worm will devour them.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	40	"You shall have olive trees throughout your territory but you will not anoint yourself with the oil, for your olives will drop off.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	41	"You shall have sons and daughters but they will not be yours, for they will go into captivity.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	42	"The cricket shall possess all your trees and the produce of your ground.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	43	"The alien who is among you shall rise above you higher and higher, but you will go down lower and lower.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	44	"He shall lend to you, but you will not lend to him; he shall be the head, and you will be the tail.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	45	"So all these curses shall come on you and pursue you and overtake you until you are destroyed, because you would not obey the LORD your God by keeping His commandments and His statutes which He commanded you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	46	"They shall become a sign and a wonder on you and your descendants forever.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	47	"Because you did not serve the LORD your God with joy and a glad heart, for the abundance of all things;
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	48	therefore you shall serve your enemies whom the LORD will send against you, in hunger, in thirst, in nakedness, and in the lack of all things; and He will put an iron yoke on your neck until He has destroyed you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	49	"The LORD will bring a nation against you from afar, from the end of the earth, as the eagle swoops down, a nation whose language you shall not understand,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	50	a nation of fierce countenance who will have no respect for the old, nor show favor to the young.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	51	"Moreover, it shall eat the offspring of your herd and the produce of your ground until you are destroyed, who also leaves you no grain, new wine, or oil, nor the increase of your herd or the young of your flock until they have caused you to perish.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	52	"It shall besiege you in all your towns until your high and fortified walls in which you trusted come down throughout your land, and it shall besiege you in all your towns throughout your land which the LORD your God has given you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	53	"Then you shall eat the offspring of your own body, the flesh of your sons and of your daughters whom the LORD your God has given you, during the siege and the distress by which your enemy will oppress you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	54	"The man who is refined and very delicate among you shall be hostile toward his brother and toward the wife he cherishes and toward the rest of his children who remain,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	55	so that he will not give even one of them any of the flesh of his children which he will eat, since he has nothing else left, during the siege and the distress by which your enemy will oppress you in all your towns.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	56	"The refined and delicate woman among you, who would not venture to set the sole of her foot on the ground for delicateness and refinement, shall be hostile toward the husband she cherishes and toward her son and daughter,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	57	and toward her afterbirth which issues from between her legs and toward her children whom she bears; for she will eat them secretly for lack of anything else, during the siege and the distress by which your enemy will oppress you in your towns.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	58	"If you are not careful to observe all the words of this law which are written in this book, to fear this honored and awesome name, the LORD your God,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	59	then the LORD will bring extraordinary plagues on you and your descendants, even severe and lasting plagues, and miserable and chronic sicknesses.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	60	"He will bring back on you all the diseases of Egypt of which you were afraid, and they will cling to you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	61	"Also every sickness and every plague which, not written in the book of this law, the LORD will bring on you until you are destroyed.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	62	"Then you shall be left few in number, whereas you were as numerous as the stars of heaven, because you did not obey the LORD your God.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	63	"It shall come about that as the LORD delighted over you to prosper you, and multiply you, so the LORD will delight over you to make you perish and destroy you; and you will be torn from the land where you are entering to possess it.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	64	"Moreover, the LORD will scatter you among all peoples, from one end of the earth to the other end of the earth; and there you shall serve other gods, wood and stone, which you or your fathers have not known.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	65	"Among those nations you shall find no rest, and there will be no resting place for the sole of your foot; but there the LORD will give you a trembling heart, failing of eyes, and despair of soul.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	66	"So your life shall hang in doubt before you; and you will be in dread night and day, and shall have no assurance of your life.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	67	"In the morning you shall say, 'Would that it were evening!' And at evening you shall say, 'Would that it were morning!' because of the dread of your heart which you dread, and for the sight of your eyes which you will see.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	28	68	"The LORD will bring you back to Egypt in ships, by the way about which I spoke to you, 'You will never see it again!' And there you will offer yourselves for sale to your enemies as male and female slaves, but there will be no buyer."
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	29	1	These are the words of the covenant which the LORD commanded Moses to make with the sons of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which He had made with them at Horeb.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	29	2	And Moses summoned all Israel and said to them, "You have seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh and all his servants and all his land;
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	29	3	the great trials which your eyes have seen, those great signs and wonders.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	29	4	"Yet to this day the LORD has not given you a heart to know, nor eyes to see, nor ears to hear.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	29	5	"I have led you forty years in the wilderness; your clothes have not worn out on you, and your sandal has not worn out on your foot.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	29	6	"You have not eaten bread, nor have you drunk wine or strong drink, in order that you might know that I am the LORD your God.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	29	7	"When you reached this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon and Og the king of Bashan came out to meet us for battle, but we defeated them;
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	29	8	and we took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of the Manassites.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	29	9	"So keep the words of this covenant to do them, that you may prosper in all that you do.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	29	10	"You stand today, all of you, before the LORD your God: your chiefs, your tribes, your elders and your officers, even all the men of Israel,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	29	11	your little ones, your wives, and the alien who is within your camps, from the one who chops your wood to the one who draws your water,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	29	12	that you may enter into the covenant with the LORD your God, and into His oath which the LORD your God is making with you today,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	29	13	in order that He may establish you today as His people and that He may be your God, just as He spoke to you and as He swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	29	14	"Now not with you alone am I making this covenant and this oath,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	29	15	but both with those who stand here with us today in the presence of the LORD our God and with those who are not with us here today
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	29	16	(for you know how we lived in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the midst of the nations through which you passed;
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	29	17	moreover, you have seen their abominations and their idols of wood, stone, silver, and gold, which they had with them);
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	29	18	so that there will not be among you a man or woman, or family or tribe, whose heart turns away today from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of those nations; that there will not be among you a root bearing poisonous fruit and wormwood.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	29	19	"It shall be when he hears the words of this curse, that he will boast, saying, 'I have peace though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart in order to destroy the watered land with the dry.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	29	20	"The LORD shall never be willing to forgive him, but rather the anger of the LORD and His jealousy will burn against that man, and every curse which is written in this book will rest on him, and the LORD will blot out his name from under heaven.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	29	21	"Then the LORD will single him out for adversity from all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant which are written in this book of the law.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	29	22	"Now the generation to come, your sons who rise up after you and the foreigner who comes from a distant land, when they see the plagues of the land and the diseases with which the LORD has afflicted it, will say,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	29	23	'All its land is brimstone and salt, a burning waste, unsown and unproductive, and no grass grows in it, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which the LORD overthrew in His anger and in His wrath.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	29	24	"All the nations will say, 'Why has the LORD done thus to this land? Why this great outburst of anger?'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	29	25	"Then men will say, 'Because they forsook the covenant of the LORD, the God of their fathers, which He made with them when He brought them out of the land of Egypt.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	29	26	'They went and served other gods and worshiped them, gods whom they have not known and whom He had not allotted to them.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	29	27	'Therefore, the anger of the LORD burned against that land, to bring upon it every curse which is written in this book;
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	29	28	and the LORD uprooted them from their land in anger and in fury and in great wrath, and cast them into another land, as it is this day.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	29	29	"The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our sons forever, that we may observe all the words of this law.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	30	1	"So it shall be when all of these things have come upon you, the blessing and the curse which I have set before you, and you call them to mind in all nations where the LORD your God has banished you,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	30	2	and you return to the LORD your God and obey Him with all your heart and soul according to all that I command you today, you and your sons,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	30	3	then the LORD your God will restore you from captivity, and have compassion on you, and will gather you again from all the peoples where the LORD your God has scattered you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	30	4	"If your outcasts are at the ends of the earth, from there the LORD your God will gather you, and from there He will bring you back.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	30	5	"The LORD your God will bring you into the land which your fathers possessed, and you shall possess it; and He will prosper you and multiply you more than your fathers.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	30	6	"Moreover the LORD your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your descendants, to love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul, so that you may live.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	30	7	"The LORD your God will inflict all these curses on your enemies and on those who hate you, who persecuted you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	30	8	"And you shall again obey the LORD, and observe all His commandments which I command you today.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	30	9	"Then the LORD your God will prosper you abundantly in all the work of your hand, in the offspring of your body and in the offspring of your cattle and in the produce of your ground, for the LORD will again rejoice over you for good, just as He rejoiced over your fathers;
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	30	10	if you obey the LORD your God to keep His commandments and His statutes which are written in this book of the law, if you turn to the LORD your God with all your heart and soul.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	30	11	"For this commandment which I command you today is not too difficult for you, nor is it out of reach.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	30	12	"It is not in heaven, that you should say, 'Who will go up to heaven for us to get it for us and make us hear it, that we may observe it?'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	30	13	"Nor is it beyond the sea, that you should say, 'Who will cross the sea for us to get it for us and make us hear it, that we may observe it?'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	30	14	"But the word is very near you, in your mouth and in your heart, that you may observe it.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	30	15	"See, I have set before you today life and prosperity, and death and adversity;
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	30	16	in that I command you today to love the LORD your God, to walk in His ways and to keep His commandments and His statutes and His judgments, that you may live and multiply, and that the LORD your God may bless you in the land where you are entering to possess it.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	30	17	"But if your heart turns away and you will not obey, but are drawn away and worship other gods and serve them,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	30	18	I declare to you today that you shall surely perish. You will not prolong your days in the land where you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess it.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	30	19	"I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse. So choose life in order that you may live, you and your descendants,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	30	20	by loving the LORD your God, by obeying His voice, and by holding fast to Him; for this is your life and the length of your days, that you may live in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give them."
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	31	1	So Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	31	2	And he said to them, "I am a hundred and twenty years old today; I am no longer able to come and go, and the LORD has said to me, 'You shall not cross this Jordan.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	31	3	"It is the LORD your God who will cross ahead of you; He will destroy these nations before you, and you shall dispossess them. Joshua is the one who will cross ahead of you, just as the LORD has spoken.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	31	4	"The LORD will do to them just as He did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land, when He destroyed them.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	31	5	"The LORD will deliver them up before you, and you shall do to them according to all the commandments which I have commanded you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	31	6	"Be strong and courageous, do not be afraid or tremble at them, for the LORD your God is the one who goes with you. He will not fail you or forsake you."
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	31	7	Then Moses called to Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel, "Be strong and courageous, for you shall go with this people into the land which the LORD has sworn to their fathers to give them, and you shall give it to them as an inheritance.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	31	8	"The LORD is the one who goes ahead of you; He will be with you. He will not fail you or forsake you. Do not fear or be dismayed."
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	31	9	So Moses wrote this law and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and to all the elders of Israel.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	31	10	Then Moses commanded them, saying, "At the end of every seven years, at the time of the year of remission of debts, at the Feast of Booths,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	31	11	when all Israel comes to appear before the LORD your God at the place which He will choose, you shall read this law in front of all Israel in their hearing.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	31	12	"Assemble the people, the men and the women and children and the alien who is in your town, so that they may hear and learn and fear the LORD your God, and be careful to observe all the words of this law.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	31	13	"Their children, who have not known, will hear and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as you live on the land which you are about to cross the Jordan to possess."
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	31	14	Then the LORD said to Moses, "Behold, the time for you to die is near; call Joshua, and present yourselves at the tent of meeting, that I may commission him." So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves at the tent of meeting.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	31	15	The LORD appeared in the tent in a pillar of cloud, and the pillar of cloud stood at the doorway of the tent.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	31	16	The LORD said to Moses, "Behold, you are about to lie down with your fathers; and this people will arise and play the harlot with the strange gods of the land, into the midst of which they are going, and will forsake Me and break My covenant which I have made with them.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	31	17	"Then My anger will be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them and hide My face from them, and they will be consumed, and many evils and troubles will come upon them; so that they will say in that day, 'Is it not because our God is not among us that these evils have come upon us?'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	31	18	"But I will surely hide My face in that day because of all the evil which they will do, for they will turn to other gods.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	31	19	"Now therefore, write this song for yourselves, and teach it to the sons of Israel; put it on their lips, so that this song may be a witness for Me against the sons of Israel.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	31	20	"For when I bring them into the land flowing with milk and honey, which I swore to their fathers, and they have eaten and are satisfied and become prosperous, then they will turn to other gods and serve them, and spurn Me and break My covenant.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	31	21	"Then it shall come about, when many evils and troubles have come upon them, that this song will testify before them as a witness (for it shall not be forgotten from the lips of their descendants); for I know their intent which they are developing today, before I have brought them into the land which I swore."
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	31	22	So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it to the sons of Israel.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	31	23	Then He commissioned Joshua the son of Nun, and said, "Be strong and courageous, for you shall bring the sons of Israel into the land which I swore to them, and I will be with you."
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	31	24	It came about, when Moses finished writing the words of this law in a book until they were complete,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	31	25	that Moses commanded the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	31	26	"Take this book of the law and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may remain there as a witness against you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	31	27	"For I know your rebellion and your stubbornness; behold, while I am still alive with you today, you have been rebellious against the LORD; how much more, then, after my death?
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	31	28	"Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes and your officers, that I may speak these words in their hearing and call the heavens and the earth to witness against them.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	31	29	"For I know that after my death you will act corruptly and turn from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days, for you will do that which is evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him to anger with the work of your hands."
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	31	30	Then Moses spoke in the hearing of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were complete:
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	1	"Give ear, O heavens, and let me speak; And let the earth hear the words of my mouth.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	2	"Let my teaching drop as the rain, My speech distill as the dew, As the droplets on the fresh grass And as the showers on the herb.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	3	"For I proclaim the name of the LORD; Ascribe greatness to our God!
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	4	"The Rock! His work is perfect, For all His ways are just; A God of faithfulness and without injustice, Righteous and upright is He.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	5	"They have acted corruptly toward Him, They are not His children, because of their defect; But are a perverse and crooked generation.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	6	"Do you thus repay the LORD, O foolish and unwise people? Is not He your Father who has bought you? He has made you and established you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	7	"Remember the days of old, Consider the years of all generations. Ask your father, and he will inform you, Your elders, and they will tell you.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	8	"When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance, When He separated the sons of man, He set the boundaries of the peoples According to the number of the sons of Israel.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	9	"For the LORD'S portion is His people; Jacob is the allotment of His inheritance.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	10	"He found him in a desert land, And in the howling waste of a wilderness; He encircled him, He cared for him, He guarded him as the pupil of His eye.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	11	"Like an eagle that stirs up its nest, That hovers over its young, He spread His wings and caught them, He carried them on His pinions.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	12	"The LORD alone guided him, And there was no foreign god with him.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	13	"He made him ride on the high places of the earth, And he ate the produce of the field; And He made him suck honey from the rock, And oil from the flinty rock,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	14	Curds of cows, and milk of the flock, With fat of lambs, And rams, the breed of Bashan, and goats, With the finest of the wheat-- And of the blood of grapes you drank wine.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	15	"But Jeshurun grew fat and kicked-- You are grown fat, thick, and sleek-- Then he forsook God who made him, And scorned the Rock of his salvation.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	16	"They made Him jealous with strange gods; With abominations they provoked Him to anger.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	17	"They sacrificed to demons who were not God, To gods whom they have not known, New gods who came lately, Whom your fathers did not dread.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	18	"You neglected the Rock who begot you, And forgot the God who gave you birth.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	19	"The LORD saw this, and spurned them Because of the provocation of His sons and daughters.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	20	"Then He said, 'I will hide My face from them, I will see what their end shall be; For they are a perverse generation, Sons in whom is no faithfulness.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	21	'They have made Me jealous with what is not God; They have provoked Me to anger with their idols. So I will make them jealous with those who are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	22	For a fire is kindled in My anger, And burns to the lowest part of Sheol, And consumes the earth with its yield, And sets on fire the foundations of the mountains.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	23	'I will heap misfortunes on them; I will use My arrows on them.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	24	'They will be wasted by famine, and consumed by plague And bitter destruction; And the teeth of beasts I will send upon them, With the venom of crawling things of the dust.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	25	'Outside the sword will bereave, And inside terror-- Both young man and virgin, The nursling with the man of gray hair.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	26	'I would have said, "I will cut them to pieces, I will remove the memory of them from men,"
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	27	Had I not feared the provocation by the enemy, That their adversaries would misjudge, That they would say, "Our hand is triumphant, And the LORD has not done all this."'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	28	"For they are a nation lacking in counsel, And there is no understanding in them.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	29	"Would that they were wise, that they understood this, That they would discern their future!
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	30	"How could one chase a thousand, And two put ten thousand to flight, Unless their Rock had sold them, And the LORD had given them up?
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	31	"Indeed their rock is not like our Rock, Even our enemies themselves judge this.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	32	"For their vine is from the vine of Sodom, And from the fields of Gomorrah; Their grapes are grapes of poison, Their clusters, bitter.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	33	"Their wine is the venom of serpents, And the deadly poison of cobras.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	34	'Is it not laid up in store with Me, Sealed up in My treasuries?
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	35	'Vengeance is Mine, and retribution, In due time their foot will slip; For the day of their calamity is near, And the impending things are hastening upon them.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	36	"For the LORD will vindicate His people, And will have compassion on His servants, When He sees that their strength is gone, And there is none remaining, bond or free.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	37	"And He will say, 'Where are their gods, The rock in which they sought refuge?
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	38	'Who ate the fat of their sacrifices, And drank the wine of their drink offering? Let them rise up and help you, Let them be your hiding place!
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	39	'See now that I, I am He, And there is no god besides Me; It is I who put to death and give life. I have wounded and it is I who heal, And there is no one who can deliver from My hand.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	40	'Indeed, I lift up My hand to heaven, And say, as I live forever,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	41	If I sharpen My flashing sword, And My hand takes hold on justice, I will render vengeance on My adversaries, And I will repay those who hate Me.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	42	'I will make My arrows drunk with blood, And My sword will devour flesh, With the blood of the slain and the captives, From the long-haired leaders of the enemy.'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	43	"Rejoice, O nations, with His people; For He will avenge the blood of His servants, And will render vengeance on His adversaries, And will atone for His land and His people."
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	44	Then Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the hearing of the people, he, with Joshua the son of Nun.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	45	When Moses had finished speaking all these words to all Israel,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	46	he said to them, "Take to your heart all the words with which I am warning you today, which you shall command your sons to observe carefully, even all the words of this law.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	47	"For it is not an idle word for you; indeed it is your life. And by this word you will prolong your days in the land, which you are about to cross the Jordan to possess."
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	48	The LORD spoke to Moses that very same day, saying,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	49	"Go up to this mountain of the Abarim, Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab opposite Jericho, and look at the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the sons of Israel for a possession.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	50	"Then die on the mountain where you ascend, and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	51	because you broke faith with Me in the midst of the sons of Israel at the waters of Meribah-kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin, because you did not treat Me as holy in the midst of the sons of Israel.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	32	52	"For you shall see the land at a distance, but you shall not go there, into the land which I am giving the sons of Israel."
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	33	1	Now this is the blessing with which Moses the man of God blessed the sons of Israel before his death.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	33	2	He said, "The LORD came from Sinai, And dawned on them from Seir; He shone forth from Mount Paran, And He came from the midst of ten thousand holy ones; At His right hand there was flashing lightning for them.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	33	3	"Indeed, He loves the people; All Your holy ones are in Your hand, And they followed in Your steps; Everyone receives of Your words.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	33	4	"Moses charged us with a law, A possession for the assembly of Jacob.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	33	5	"And He was king in Jeshurun, When the heads of the people were gathered, The tribes of Israel together.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	33	6	"May Reuben live and not die, Nor his men be few."
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	33	7	And this regarding Judah; so he said, "Hear, O LORD, the voice of Judah, And bring him to his people. With his hands he contended for them, And may You be a help against his adversaries."
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	33	8	Of Levi he said, "Let Your Thummim and Your Urim belong to Your godly man, Whom You proved at Massah, With whom You contended at the waters of Meribah;
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	33	9	Who said of his father and his mother, 'I did not consider them'; And he did not acknowledge his brothers, Nor did he regard his own sons, For they observed Your word, And kept Your covenant.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	33	10	"They shall teach Your ordinances to Jacob, And Your law to Israel. They shall put incense before You, And whole burnt offerings on Your altar.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	33	11	"O LORD, bless his substance, And accept the work of his hands; Shatter the loins of those who rise up against him, And those who hate him, so that they will not rise again."
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	33	12	Of Benjamin he said, "May the beloved of the LORD dwell in security by Him, Who shields him all the day, And he dwells between His shoulders."
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	33	13	Of Joseph he said, "Blessed of the LORD be his land, With the choice things of heaven, with the dew, And from the deep lying beneath,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	33	14	And with the choice yield of the sun, And with the choice produce of the months.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	33	15	"And with the best things of the ancient mountains, And with the choice things of the everlasting hills,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	33	16	And with the choice things of the earth and its fullness, And the favor of Him who dwelt in the bush. Let it come to the head of Joseph, And to the crown of the head of the one distinguished among his brothers.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	33	17	"As the firstborn of his ox, majesty is his, And his horns are the horns of the wild ox; With them he will push the peoples, All at once, to the ends of the earth. And those are the ten thousands of Ephraim, And those are the thousands of Manasseh."
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	33	18	Of Zebulun he said, "Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going forth, And, Issachar, in your tents.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	33	19	"They will call peoples to the mountain; There they will offer righteous sacrifices; For they will draw out the abundance of the seas, And the hidden treasures of the sand."
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	33	20	Of Gad he said, "Blessed is the one who enlarges Gad; He lies down as a lion, And tears the arm, also the crown of the head.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	33	21	"Then he provided the first part for himself, For there the ruler's portion was reserved; And he came with the leaders of the people; He executed the justice of the LORD, And His ordinances with Israel."
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	33	22	Of Dan he said, "Dan is a lion's whelp, That leaps forth from Bashan."
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	33	23	Of Naphtali he said, "O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, And full of the blessing of the LORD, Take possession of the sea and the south."
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	33	24	Of Asher he said, "More blessed than sons is Asher; May he be favored by his brothers, And may he dip his foot in oil.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	33	25	"Your locks will be iron and bronze, And according to your days, so will your leisurely walk be.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	33	26	"There is none like the God of Jeshurun, Who rides the heavens to your help, And through the skies in His majesty.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	33	27	"The eternal God is a dwelling place, And underneath are the everlasting arms; And He drove out the enemy from before you, And said, 'Destroy!'
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	33	28	"So Israel dwells in security, The fountain of Jacob secluded, In a land of grain and new wine; His heavens also drop down dew.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	33	29	"Blessed are you, O Israel; Who is like you, a people saved by the LORD, Who is the shield of your help And the sword of your majesty! So your enemies will cringe before you, And you will tread upon their high places."
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	34	1	Now Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which is opposite Jericho. And the LORD showed him all the land, Gilead as far as Dan,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	34	2	and all Naphtali and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah as far as the western sea,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	34	3	and the Negev and the plain in the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, as far as Zoar.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	34	4	Then the LORD said to him, "This is the land which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, 'I will give it to your descendants'; I have let you see it with your eyes, but you shall not go over there."
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	34	5	So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	34	6	And He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth-peor; but no man knows his burial place to this day.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	34	7	Although Moses was one hundred and twenty years old when he died, his eye was not dim, nor his vigor abated.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	34	8	So the sons of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days; then the days of weeping and mourning for Moses came to an end.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	34	9	Now Joshua the son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands on him; and the sons of Israel listened to him and did as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	34	10	Since that time no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	34	11	for all the signs and wonders which the LORD sent him to perform in the land of Egypt against Pharaoh, all his servants, and all his land,
Deuteronomy	Deu	5	34	12	and for all the mighty power and for all the great terror which Moses performed in the sight of all Israel.
Joshua	Josh	6	1	1	Now it came about after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD, that the LORD spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' servant, saying,
Joshua	Josh	6	1	2	"Moses My servant is dead; now therefore arise, cross this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them, to the sons of Israel.
Joshua	Josh	6	1	3	"Every place on which the sole of your foot treads, I have given it to you, just as I spoke to Moses.
Joshua	Josh	6	1	4	"From the wilderness and this Lebanon, even as far as the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and as far as the Great Sea toward the setting of the sun will be your territory.
Joshua	Josh	6	1	5	"No man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life. Just as I have been with Moses, I will be with you; I will not fail you or forsake you.
Joshua	Josh	6	1	6	"Be strong and courageous, for you shall give this people possession of the land which I swore to their fathers to give them.
Joshua	Josh	6	1	7	"Only be strong and very courageous; be careful to do according to all the law which Moses My servant commanded you; do not turn from it to the right or to the left, so that you may have success wherever you go.
Joshua	Josh	6	1	8	"This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it; for then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have success.
Joshua	Josh	6	1	9	"Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous! Do not tremble or be dismayed, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go."
Joshua	Josh	6	1	10	Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
Joshua	Josh	6	1	11	"Pass through the midst of the camp and command the people, saying, 'Prepare provisions for yourselves, for within three days you are to cross this Jordan, to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God is giving you, to possess it.'"
Joshua	Josh	6	1	12	To the Reubenites and to the Gadites and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said,
Joshua	Josh	6	1	13	"Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, 'The LORD your God gives you rest and will give you this land.'
Joshua	Josh	6	1	14	"Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle shall remain in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan, but you shall cross before your brothers in battle array, all your valiant warriors, and shall help them,
Joshua	Josh	6	1	15	until the LORD gives your brothers rest, as He gives you, and they also possess the land which the LORD your God is giving them. Then you shall return to your own land, and possess that which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise."
Joshua	Josh	6	1	16	They answered Joshua, saying, "All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.
Joshua	Josh	6	1	17	"Just as we obeyed Moses in all things, so we will obey you; only may the LORD your God be with you as He was with Moses.
Joshua	Josh	6	1	18	"Anyone who rebels against your command and does not obey your words in all that you command him, shall be put to death; only be strong and courageous."
Joshua	Josh	6	2	1	Then Joshua the son of Nun sent two men as spies secretly from Shittim, saying, "Go, view the land, especially Jericho." So they went and came into the house of a harlot whose name was Rahab, and lodged there.
Joshua	Josh	6	2	2	It was told the king of Jericho, saying, "Behold, men from the sons of Israel have come here tonight to search out the land."
Joshua	Josh	6	2	3	And the king of Jericho sent word to Rahab, saying, "Bring out the men who have come to you, who have entered your house, for they have come to search out all the land."
Joshua	Josh	6	2	4	But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them, and she said, "Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they were from.
Joshua	Josh	6	2	5	"It came about when it was time to shut the gate at dark, that the men went out; I do not know where the men went. Pursue them quickly, for you will overtake them."
Joshua	Josh	6	2	6	But she had brought them up to the roof and hidden them in the stalks of flax which she had laid in order on the roof.
Joshua	Josh	6	2	7	So the men pursued them on the road to the Jordan to the fords; and as soon as those who were pursuing them had gone out, they shut the gate.
Joshua	Josh	6	2	8	Now before they lay down, she came up to them on the roof,
Joshua	Josh	6	2	9	and said to the men, "I know that the LORD has given you the land, and that the terror of you has fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land have melted away before you.
Joshua	Josh	6	2	10	"For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed.
Joshua	Josh	6	2	11	"When we heard it, our hearts melted and no courage remained in any man any longer because of you; for the LORD your God, He is God in heaven above and on earth beneath.
Joshua	Josh	6	2	12	"Now therefore, please swear to me by the LORD, since I have dealt kindly with you, that you also will deal kindly with my father's household, and give me a pledge of truth,
Joshua	Josh	6	2	13	and spare my father and my mother and my brothers and my sisters, with all who belong to them, and deliver our lives from death."
Joshua	Josh	6	2	14	So the men said to her, "Our life for yours if you do not tell this business of ours; and it shall come about when the LORD gives us the land that we will deal kindly and faithfully with you."
Joshua	Josh	6	2	15	Then she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was on the city wall, so that she was living on the wall.
Joshua	Josh	6	2	16	She said to them, "Go to the hill country, so that the pursuers will not happen upon you, and hide yourselves there for three days until the pursuers return. Then afterward you may go on your way."
Joshua	Josh	6	2	17	The men said to her, "We shall be free from this oath to you which you have made us swear,
Joshua	Josh	6	2	18	unless, when we come into the land, you tie this cord of scarlet thread in the window through which you let us down, and gather to yourself into the house your father and your mother and your brothers and all your father's household.
Joshua	Josh	6	2	19	"It shall come about that anyone who goes out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood shall be on his own head, and we shall be free; but anyone who is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head if a hand is laid on him.
Joshua	Josh	6	2	20	"But if you tell this business of ours, then we shall be free from the oath which you have made us swear."
Joshua	Josh	6	2	21	She said, "According to your words, so be it." So she sent them away, and they departed; and she tied the scarlet cord in the window.
Joshua	Josh	6	2	22	They departed and came to the hill country, and remained there for three days until the pursuers returned. Now the pursuers had sought them all along the road, but had not found them.
Joshua	Josh	6	2	23	Then the two men returned and came down from the hill country and crossed over and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and they related to him all that had happened to them.
Joshua	Josh	6	2	24	They said to Joshua, "Surely the LORD has given all the land into our hands; moreover, all the inhabitants of the land have melted away before us."
Joshua	Josh	6	3	1	Then Joshua rose early in the morning; and he and all the sons of Israel set out from Shittim and came to the Jordan, and they lodged there before they crossed.
Joshua	Josh	6	3	2	At the end of three days the officers went through the midst of the camp;
Joshua	Josh	6	3	3	and they commanded the people, saying, "When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God with the Levitical priests carrying it, then you shall set out from your place and go after it.
Joshua	Josh	6	3	4	"However, there shall be between you and it a distance of about 2,cubits by measure. Do not come near it, that you may know the way by which you shall go, for you have not passed this way before."
Joshua	Josh	6	3	5	Then Joshua said to the people, "Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the LORD will do wonders among you."
Joshua	Josh	6	3	6	And Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, "Take up the ark of the covenant and cross over ahead of the people." So they took up the ark of the covenant and went ahead of the people.
Joshua	Josh	6	3	7	Now the LORD said to Joshua, "This day I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that just as I have been with Moses, I will be with you.
Joshua	Josh	6	3	8	"You shall, moreover, command the priests who are carrying the ark of the covenant, saying, 'When you come to the edge of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan.'"
Joshua	Josh	6	3	9	Then Joshua said to the sons of Israel, "Come here, and hear the words of the LORD your God."
Joshua	Josh	6	3	10	Joshua said, "By this you shall know that the living God is among you, and that He will assuredly dispossess from before you the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Hivite, the Perizzite, the Girgashite, the Amorite, and the Jebusite.
Joshua	Josh	6	3	11	"Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is crossing over ahead of you into the Jordan.
Joshua	Josh	6	3	12	"Now then, take for yourselves twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one man for each tribe.
Joshua	Josh	6	3	13	"It shall come about when the soles of the feet of the priests who carry the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan will be cut off, and the waters which are flowing down from above will stand in one heap."
Joshua	Josh	6	3	14	So when the people set out from their tents to cross the Jordan with the priests carrying the ark of the covenant before the people,
Joshua	Josh	6	3	15	and when those who carried the ark came into the Jordan, and the feet of the priests carrying the ark were dipped in the edge of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its banks all the days of harvest),
Joshua	Josh	6	3	16	the waters which were flowing down from above stood and rose up in one heap, a great distance away at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan; and those which were flowing down toward the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, were completely cut off. So the people crossed opposite Jericho.
Joshua	Josh	6	3	17	And the priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan while all Israel crossed on dry ground, until all the nation had finished crossing the Jordan.
Joshua	Josh	6	4	1	Now when all the nation had finished crossing the Jordan, the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying,
Joshua	Josh	6	4	2	"Take for yourselves twelve men from the people, one man from each tribe,
Joshua	Josh	6	4	3	and command them, saying, 'Take up for yourselves twelve stones from here out of the middle of the Jordan, from the place where the priests' feet are standing firm, and carry them over with you and lay them down in the lodging place where you will lodge tonight.'"
Joshua	Josh	6	4	4	So Joshua called the twelve men whom he had appointed from the sons of Israel, one man from each tribe;
Joshua	Josh	6	4	5	and Joshua said to them, "Cross again to the ark of the LORD your God into the middle of the Jordan, and each of you take up a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel.
Joshua	Josh	6	4	6	"Let this be a sign among you, so that when your children ask later, saying, 'What do these stones mean to you?'
Joshua	Josh	6	4	7	then you shall say to them, 'Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it crossed the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off.' So these stones shall become a memorial to the sons of Israel forever."
Joshua	Josh	6	4	8	Thus the sons of Israel did as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, just as the LORD spoke to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel; and they carried them over with them to the lodging place and put them down there.
Joshua	Josh	6	4	9	Then Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan at the place where the feet of the priests who carried the ark of the covenant were standing, and they are there to this day.
Joshua	Josh	6	4	10	For the priests who carried the ark were standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything was completed that the LORD had commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua. And the people hurried and crossed;
Joshua	Josh	6	4	11	and when all the people had finished crossing, the ark of the LORD and the priests crossed before the people.
Joshua	Josh	6	4	12	The sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over in battle array before the sons of Israel, just as Moses had spoken to them;
Joshua	Josh	6	4	13	about 40,equipped for war, crossed for battle before the LORD to the desert plains of Jericho.
Joshua	Josh	6	4	14	On that day the LORD exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel; so that they revered him, just as they had revered Moses all the days of his life.
Joshua	Josh	6	4	15	Now the LORD said to Joshua,
Joshua	Josh	6	4	16	"Command the priests who carry the ark of the testimony that they come up from the Jordan."
Joshua	Josh	6	4	17	So Joshua commanded the priests, saying, "Come up from the Jordan."
Joshua	Josh	6	4	18	It came about when the priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD had come up from the middle of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up to the dry ground, that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place, and went over all its banks as before.
Joshua	Josh	6	4	19	Now the people came up from the Jordan on the tenth of the first month and camped at Gilgal on the eastern edge of Jericho.
Joshua	Josh	6	4	20	Those twelve stones which they had taken from the Jordan, Joshua set up at Gilgal.
Joshua	Josh	6	4	21	He said to the sons of Israel, "When your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, 'What are these stones?'
Joshua	Josh	6	4	22	then you shall inform your children, saying, 'Israel crossed this Jordan on dry ground.'
Joshua	Josh	6	4	23	"For the LORD your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you until you had crossed, just as the LORD your God had done to the Red Sea, which He dried up before us until we had crossed;
Joshua	Josh	6	4	24	that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of the LORD is mighty, so that you may fear the LORD your God forever."
Joshua	Josh	6	5	1	Now it came about when all the kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan to the west, and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea, heard how the LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the sons of Israel until they had crossed, that their hearts melted, and there was no spirit in them any longer because of the sons of Israel.
Joshua	Josh	6	5	2	At that time the LORD said to Joshua, "Make for yourself flint knives and circumcise again the sons of Israel the second time."
Joshua	Josh	6	5	3	So Joshua made himself flint knives and circumcised the sons of Israel at Gibeath-haaraloth.
Joshua	Josh	6	5	4	This is the reason why Joshua circumcised them: all the people who came out of Egypt who were males, all the men of war, died in the wilderness along the way after they came out of Egypt.
Joshua	Josh	6	5	5	For all the people who came out were circumcised, but all the people who were born in the wilderness along the way as they came out of Egypt had not been circumcised.
Joshua	Josh	6	5	6	For the sons of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, until all the nation, that is, the men of war who came out of Egypt, perished because they did not listen to the voice of the LORD, to whom the LORD had sworn that He would not let them see the land which the LORD had sworn to their fathers to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.
Joshua	Josh	6	5	7	Their children whom He raised up in their place, Joshua circumcised; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them along the way.
Joshua	Josh	6	5	8	Now when they had finished circumcising all the nation, they remained in their places in the camp until they were healed.
Joshua	Josh	6	5	9	Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you." So the name of that place is called Gilgal to this day.
Joshua	Josh	6	5	10	While the sons of Israel camped at Gilgal they observed the Passover on the evening of the fourteenth day of the month on the desert plains of Jericho.
Joshua	Josh	6	5	11	On the day after the Passover, on that very day, they ate some of the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and parched grain.
Joshua	Josh	6	5	12	The manna ceased on the day after they had eaten some of the produce of the land, so that the sons of Israel no longer had manna, but they ate some of the yield of the land of Canaan during that year.
Joshua	Josh	6	5	13	Now it came about when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man was standing opposite him with his sword drawn in his hand, and Joshua went to him and said to him, "Are you for us or for our adversaries?"
Joshua	Josh	6	5	14	He said, "No; rather I indeed come now as captain of the host of the LORD." And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and bowed down, and said to him, "What has my lord to say to his servant?"
Joshua	Josh	6	5	15	The captain of the LORD'S host said to Joshua, "Remove your sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy." And Joshua did so.
Joshua	Josh	6	6	1	Now Jericho was tightly shut because of the sons of Israel; no one went out and no one came in.
Joshua	Josh	6	6	2	The LORD said to Joshua, "See, I have given Jericho into your hand, with its king and the valiant warriors.
Joshua	Josh	6	6	3	"You shall march around the city, all the men of war circling the city once. You shall do so for six days.
Joshua	Josh	6	6	4	"Also seven priests shall carry seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark; then on the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets.
Joshua	Josh	6	6	5	"It shall be that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city will fall down flat, and the people will go up every man straight ahead."
Joshua	Josh	6	6	6	So Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them, "Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests carry seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD."
Joshua	Josh	6	6	7	Then he said to the people, "Go forward, and march around the city, and let the armed men go on before the ark of the LORD."
Joshua	Josh	6	6	8	And it was so, that when Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the LORD went forward and blew the trumpets; and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.
Joshua	Josh	6	6	9	The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, while they continued to blow the trumpets.
Joshua	Josh	6	6	10	But Joshua commanded the people, saying, "You shall not shout nor let your voice be heard nor let a word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I tell you, 'Shout!' Then you shall shout!"
Joshua	Josh	6	6	11	So he had the ark of the LORD taken around the city, circling it once; then they came into the camp and spent the night in the camp.
Joshua	Josh	6	6	12	Now Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.
Joshua	Josh	6	6	13	The seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew the trumpets; and the armed men went before them and the rear guard came after the ark of the LORD, while they continued to blow the trumpets.
Joshua	Josh	6	6	14	Thus the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp; they did so for six days.
Joshua	Josh	6	6	15	Then on the seventh day they rose early at the dawning of the day and marched around the city in the same manner seven times; only on that day they marched around the city seven times.
Joshua	Josh	6	6	16	At the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, "Shout! For the LORD has given you the city.
Joshua	Josh	6	6	17	"The city shall be under the ban, it and all that is in it belongs to the LORD; only Rahab the harlot and all who are with her in the house shall live, because she hid the messengers whom we sent.
Joshua	Josh	6	6	18	"But as for you, only keep yourselves from the things under the ban, so that you do not covet them and take some of the things under the ban, and make the camp of Israel accursed and bring trouble on it.
Joshua	Josh	6	6	19	"But all the silver and gold and articles of bronze and iron are holy to the LORD; they shall go into the treasury of the LORD."
Joshua	Josh	6	6	20	So the people shouted, and priests blew the trumpets; and when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, the people shouted with a great shout and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight ahead, and they took the city.
Joshua	Josh	6	6	21	They utterly destroyed everything in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox and sheep and donkey, with the edge of the sword.
Joshua	Josh	6	6	22	Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, "Go into the harlot's house and bring the woman and all she has out of there, as you have sworn to her."
Joshua	Josh	6	6	23	So the young men who were spies went in and brought out Rahab and her father and her mother and her brothers and all she had; they also brought out all her relatives and placed them outside the camp of Israel.
Joshua	Josh	6	6	24	They burned the city with fire, and all that was in it. Only the silver and gold, and articles of bronze and iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.
Joshua	Josh	6	6	25	However, Rahab the harlot and her father's household and all she had, Joshua spared; and she has lived in the midst of Israel to this day, for she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
Joshua	Josh	6	6	26	Then Joshua made them take an oath at that time, saying, "Cursed before the LORD is the man who rises up and builds this city Jericho; with the loss of his firstborn he shall lay its foundation, and with the loss of his youngest son he shall set up its gates."
Joshua	Josh	6	6	27	So the LORD was with Joshua, and his fame was in all the land.
Joshua	Josh	6	7	1	But the sons of Israel acted unfaithfully in regard to the things under the ban, for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, took some of the things under the ban, therefore the anger of the LORD burned against the sons of Israel.
Joshua	Josh	6	7	2	Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth-aven, east of Bethel, and said to them, "Go up and spy out the land." So the men went up and spied out Ai.
Joshua	Josh	6	7	3	They returned to Joshua and said to him, "Do not let all the people go up; only about two or three thousand men need go up to Ai; do not make all the people toil up there, for they are few."
Joshua	Josh	6	7	4	So about three thousand men from the people went up there, but they fled from the men of Ai.
Joshua	Josh	6	7	5	The men of Ai struck down about thirty-six of their men, and pursued them from the gate as far as Shebarim and struck them down on the descent, so the hearts of the people melted and became as water.
Joshua	Josh	6	7	6	Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of the LORD until the evening, both he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust on their heads.
Joshua	Josh	6	7	7	Joshua said, "Alas, O Lord GOD, why did You ever bring this people over the Jordan, only to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? If only we had been willing to dwell beyond the Jordan!
Joshua	Josh	6	7	8	"O Lord, what can I say since Israel has turned their back before their enemies?
Joshua	Josh	6	7	9	"For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and they will surround us and cut off our name from the earth. And what will You do for Your great name?"
Joshua	Josh	6	7	10	So the LORD said to Joshua, "Rise up! Why is it that you have fallen on your face?
Joshua	Josh	6	7	11	"Israel has sinned, and they have also transgressed My covenant which I commanded them. And they have even taken some of the things under the ban and have both stolen and deceived. Moreover, they have also put them among their own things.
Joshua	Josh	6	7	12	"Therefore the sons of Israel cannot stand before their enemies; they turn their backs before their enemies, for they have become accursed. I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy the things under the ban from your midst.
Joshua	Josh	6	7	13	"Rise up! Consecrate the people and say, 'Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, for thus the LORD, the God of Israel, has said, "There are things under the ban in your midst, O Israel. You cannot stand before your enemies until you have removed the things under the ban from your midst."
Joshua	Josh	6	7	14	'In the morning then you shall come near by your tribes. And it shall be that the tribe which the LORD takes by lot shall come near by families, and the family which the LORD takes shall come near by households, and the household which the LORD takes shall come near man by man.
Joshua	Josh	6	7	15	'It shall be that the one who is taken with the things under the ban shall be burned with fire, he and all that belongs to him, because he has transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he has committed a disgraceful thing in Israel.'"
Joshua	Josh	6	7	16	So Joshua arose early in the morning and brought Israel near by tribes, and the tribe of Judah was taken.
Joshua	Josh	6	7	17	He brought the family of Judah near, and he took the family of the Zerahites; and he brought the family of the Zerahites near man by man, and Zabdi was taken.
Joshua	Josh	6	7	18	He brought his household near man by man; and Achan, son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, was taken.
Joshua	Josh	6	7	19	Then Joshua said to Achan, "My son, I implore you, give glory to the LORD, the God of Israel, and give praise to Him; and tell me now what you have done. Do not hide it from me."
Joshua	Josh	6	7	20	So Achan answered Joshua and said, "Truly, I have sinned against the LORD, the God of Israel, and this is what I did:
Joshua	Josh	6	7	21	when I saw among the spoil a beautiful mantle from Shinar and two hundred shekels of silver and a bar of gold fifty shekels in weight, then I coveted them and took them; and behold, they are concealed in the earth inside my tent with the silver underneath it."
Joshua	Josh	6	7	22	So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and behold, it was concealed in his tent with the silver underneath it.
Joshua	Josh	6	7	23	They took them from inside the tent and brought them to Joshua and to all the sons of Israel, and they poured them out before the LORD.
Joshua	Josh	6	7	24	Then Joshua and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, the silver, the mantle, the bar of gold, his sons, his daughters, his oxen, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent and all that belonged to him; and they brought them up to the valley of Achor.
Joshua	Josh	6	7	25	Joshua said, "Why have you troubled us? The LORD will trouble you this day." And all Israel stoned them with stones; and they burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones.
Joshua	Josh	6	7	26	They raised over him a great heap of stones that stands to this day, and the LORD turned from the fierceness of His anger. Therefore the name of that place has been called the valley of Achor to this day.
Joshua	Josh	6	8	1	Now the LORD said to Joshua, "Do not fear or be dismayed. Take all the people of war with you and arise, go up to Ai; see, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, his people, his city, and his land.
Joshua	Josh	6	8	2	"You shall do to Ai and its king just as you did to Jericho and its king; you shall take only its spoil and its cattle as plunder for yourselves. Set an ambush for the city behind it."
Joshua	Josh	6	8	3	So Joshua rose with all the people of war to go up to Ai; and Joshua chose 30,men, valiant warriors, and sent them out at night.
Joshua	Josh	6	8	4	He commanded them, saying, "See, you are going to ambush the city from behind it. Do not go very far from the city, but all of you be ready.
Joshua	Josh	6	8	5	"Then I and all the people who are with me will approach the city. And when they come out to meet us as at the first, we will flee before them.
Joshua	Josh	6	8	6	"They will come out after us until we have drawn them away from the city, for they will say, 'They are fleeing before us as at the first.' So we will flee before them.
Joshua	Josh	6	8	7	"And you shall rise from your ambush and take possession of the city, for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.
Joshua	Josh	6	8	8	"Then it will be when you have seized the city, that you shall set the city on fire. You shall do it according to the word of the LORD. See, I have commanded you."
Joshua	Josh	6	8	9	So Joshua sent them away, and they went to the place of ambush and remained between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai; but Joshua spent that night among the people.
Joshua	Josh	6	8	10	Now Joshua rose early in the morning and mustered the people, and he went up with the elders of Israel before the people to Ai.
Joshua	Josh	6	8	11	Then all the people of war who were with him went up and drew near and arrived in front of the city, and camped on the north side of Ai. Now there was a valley between him and Ai.
Joshua	Josh	6	8	12	And he took about 5,men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.
Joshua	Josh	6	8	13	So they stationed the people, all the army that was on the north side of the city, and its rear guard on the west side of the city, and Joshua spent that night in the midst of the valley.
Joshua	Josh	6	8	14	It came about when the king of Ai saw it, that the men of the city hurried and rose up early and went out to meet Israel in battle, he and all his people at the appointed place before the desert plain. But he did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city.
Joshua	Josh	6	8	15	Joshua and all Israel pretended to be beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.
Joshua	Josh	6	8	16	And all the people who were in the city were called together to pursue them, and they pursued Joshua and were drawn away from the city.
Joshua	Josh	6	8	17	So not a man was left in Ai or Bethel who had not gone out after Israel, and they left the city unguarded and pursued Israel.
Joshua	Josh	6	8	18	Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand." So Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city.
Joshua	Josh	6	8	19	The men in ambush rose quickly from their place, and when he had stretched out his hand, they ran and entered the city and captured it, and they quickly set the city on fire.
Joshua	Josh	6	8	20	When the men of Ai turned back and looked, behold, the smoke of the city ascended to the sky, and they had no place to flee this way or that, for the people who had been fleeing to the wilderness turned against the pursuers.
Joshua	Josh	6	8	21	When Joshua and all Israel saw that the men in ambush had captured the city and that the smoke of the city ascended, they turned back and slew the men of Ai.
Joshua	Josh	6	8	22	The others came out from the city to encounter them, so that they were trapped in the midst of Israel, some on this side and some on that side; and they slew them until no one was left of those who survived or escaped.
Joshua	Josh	6	8	23	But they took alive the king of Ai and brought him to Joshua.
Joshua	Josh	6	8	24	Now when Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the field in the wilderness where they pursued them, and all of them were fallen by the edge of the sword until they were destroyed, then all Israel returned to Ai and struck it with the edge of the sword.
Joshua	Josh	6	8	25	All who fell that day, both men and women, were 12,000--all the people of Ai.
Joshua	Josh	6	8	26	For Joshua did not withdraw his hand with which he stretched out the javelin until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.
Joshua	Josh	6	8	27	Israel took only the cattle and the spoil of that city as plunder for themselves, according to the word of the LORD which He had commanded Joshua.
Joshua	Josh	6	8	28	So Joshua burned Ai and made it a heap forever, a desolation until this day.
Joshua	Josh	6	8	29	He hanged the king of Ai on a tree until evening; and at sunset Joshua gave command and they took his body down from the tree and threw it at the entrance of the city gate, and raised over it a great heap of stones that stands to this day.
Joshua	Josh	6	8	30	Then Joshua built an altar to the LORD, the God of Israel, in Mount Ebal,
Joshua	Josh	6	8	31	just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded the sons of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of uncut stones on which no man had wielded an iron tool; and they offered burnt offerings on it to the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings.
Joshua	Josh	6	8	32	He wrote there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he had written, in the presence of the sons of Israel.
Joshua	Josh	6	8	33	All Israel with their elders and officers and their judges were standing on both sides of the ark before the Levitical priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, the stranger as well as the native. Half of them stood in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, just as Moses the servant of the LORD had given command at first to bless the people of Israel.
Joshua	Josh	6	8	34	Then afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law.
Joshua	Josh	6	8	35	There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded which Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel with the women and the little ones and the strangers who were living among them.
Joshua	Josh	6	9	1	Now it came about when all the kings who were beyond the Jordan, in the hill country and in the lowland and on all the coast of the Great Sea toward Lebanon, the Hittite and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite, heard of it,
Joshua	Josh	6	9	2	that they gathered themselves together with one accord to fight with Joshua and with Israel.
Joshua	Josh	6	9	3	When the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,
Joshua	Josh	6	9	4	they also acted craftily and set out as envoys, and took worn-out sacks on their donkeys, and wineskins worn-out and torn and mended,
Joshua	Josh	6	9	5	and worn-out and patched sandals on their feet, and worn-out clothes on themselves; and all the bread of their provision was dry and had become crumbled.
Joshua	Josh	6	9	6	They went to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal and said to him and to the men of Israel, "We have come from a far country; now therefore, make a covenant with us."
Joshua	Josh	6	9	7	The men of Israel said to the Hivites, "Perhaps you are living within our land; how then shall we make a covenant with you?"
Joshua	Josh	6	9	8	But they said to Joshua, "We are your servants." Then Joshua said to them, "Who are you and where do you come from?"
Joshua	Josh	6	9	9	They said to him, "Your servants have come from a very far country because of the fame of the LORD your God; for we have heard the report of Him and all that He did in Egypt,
Joshua	Josh	6	9	10	and all that He did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon and to Og king of Bashan who was at Ashtaroth.
Joshua	Josh	6	9	11	"So our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, 'Take provisions in your hand for the journey, and go to meet them and say to them, "We are your servants; now then, make a covenant with us."'
Joshua	Josh	6	9	12	"This our bread was warm when we took it for our provisions out of our houses on the day that we left to come to you; but now behold, it is dry and has become crumbled.
Joshua	Josh	6	9	13	"These wineskins which we filled were new, and behold, they are torn; and these our clothes and our sandals are worn out because of the very long journey."
Joshua	Josh	6	9	14	So the men of Israel took some of their provisions, and did not ask for the counsel of the LORD.
Joshua	Josh	6	9	15	Joshua made peace with them and made a covenant with them, to let them live; and the leaders of the congregation swore an oath to them.
Joshua	Josh	6	9	16	It came about at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were neighbors and that they were living within their land.
Joshua	Josh	6	9	17	Then the sons of Israel set out and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon and Chephirah and Beeroth and Kiriath-jearim.
Joshua	Josh	6	9	18	The sons of Israel did not strike them because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by the LORD the God of Israel. And the whole congregation grumbled against the leaders.
Joshua	Josh	6	9	19	But all the leaders said to the whole congregation, "We have sworn to them by the LORD, the God of Israel, and now we cannot touch them.
Joshua	Josh	6	9	20	"This we will do to them, even let them live, so that wrath will not be upon us for the oath which we swore to them."
Joshua	Josh	6	9	21	The leaders said to them, "Let them live." So they became hewers of wood and drawers of water for the whole congregation, just as the leaders had spoken to them.
Joshua	Josh	6	9	22	Then Joshua called for them and spoke to them, saying, "Why have you deceived us, saying, 'We are very far from you,' when you are living within our land?
Joshua	Josh	6	9	23	"Now therefore, you are cursed, and you shall never cease being slaves, both hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God."
Joshua	Josh	6	9	24	So they answered Joshua and said, "Because it was certainly told your servants that the LORD your God had commanded His servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land before you; therefore we feared greatly for our lives because of you, and have done this thing.
Joshua	Josh	6	9	25	"Now behold, we are in your hands; do as it seems good and right in your sight to do to us."
Joshua	Josh	6	9	26	Thus he did to them, and delivered them from the hands of the sons of Israel, and they did not kill them.
Joshua	Josh	6	9	27	But Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the LORD, to this day, in the place which He would choose.
Joshua	Josh	6	10	1	Now it came about when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had captured Ai, and had utterly destroyed it (just as he had done to Jericho and its king, so he had done to Ai and its king), and that the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were within their land,
Joshua	Josh	6	10	2	that he feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, like one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty.
Joshua	Josh	6	10	3	Therefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent word to Hoham king of Hebron and to Piram king of Jarmuth and to Japhia king of Lachish and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,
Joshua	Josh	6	10	4	"Come up to me and help me, and let us attack Gibeon, for it has made peace with Joshua and with the sons of Israel."
Joshua	Josh	6	10	5	So the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon, gathered together and went up, they with all their armies, and camped by Gibeon and fought against it.
Joshua	Josh	6	10	6	Then the men of Gibeon sent word to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, saying, "Do not abandon your servants; come up to us quickly and save us and help us, for all the kings of the Amorites that live in the hill country have assembled against us."
Joshua	Josh	6	10	7	So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him and all the valiant warriors.
Joshua	Josh	6	10	8	The LORD said to Joshua, "Do not fear them, for I have given them into your hands; not one of them shall stand before you."
Joshua	Josh	6	10	9	So Joshua came upon them suddenly by marching all night from Gilgal.
Joshua	Josh	6	10	10	And the LORD confounded them before Israel, and He slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and pursued them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon and struck them as far as Azekah and Makkedah.
Joshua	Josh	6	10	11	As they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth-horon, the LORD threw large stones from heaven on them as far as Azekah, and they died; there were more who died from the hailstones than those whom the sons of Israel killed with the sword.
Joshua	Josh	6	10	12	Then Joshua spoke to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the sons of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, "O sun, stand still at Gibeon, And O moon in the valley of Aijalon."
Joshua	Josh	6	10	13	So the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, Until the nation avenged themselves of their enemies. Is it not written in the book of Jashar? And the sun stopped in the middle of the sky and did not hasten to go down for about a whole day.
Joshua	Josh	6	10	14	There was no day like that before it or after it, when the LORD listened to the voice of a man; for the LORD fought for Israel.
Joshua	Josh	6	10	15	Then Joshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp to Gilgal.
Joshua	Josh	6	10	16	Now these five kings had fled and hidden themselves in the cave at Makkedah.
Joshua	Josh	6	10	17	It was told Joshua, saying, "The five kings have been found hidden in the cave at Makkedah."
Joshua	Josh	6	10	18	Joshua said, "Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave, and assign men by it to guard them,
Joshua	Josh	6	10	19	but do not stay there yourselves; pursue your enemies and attack them in the rear. Do not allow them to enter their cities, for the LORD your God has delivered them into your hand."
Joshua	Josh	6	10	20	It came about when Joshua and the sons of Israel had finished slaying them with a very great slaughter, until they were destroyed, and the survivors who remained of them had entered the fortified cities,
Joshua	Josh	6	10	21	that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace. No one uttered a word against any of the sons of Israel.
Joshua	Josh	6	10	22	Then Joshua said, "Open the mouth of the cave and bring these five kings out to me from the cave."
Joshua	Josh	6	10	23	They did so, and brought these five kings out to him from the cave: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.
Joshua	Josh	6	10	24	When they brought these kings out to Joshua, Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the chiefs of the men of war who had gone with him, "Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings." So they came near and put their feet on their necks.
Joshua	Josh	6	10	25	Joshua then said to them, "Do not fear or be dismayed! Be strong and courageous, for thus the LORD will do to all your enemies with whom you fight."
Joshua	Josh	6	10	26	So afterward Joshua struck them and put them to death, and he hanged them on five trees; and they hung on the trees until evening.
Joshua	Josh	6	10	27	It came about at sunset that Joshua gave a command, and they took them down from the trees and threw them into the cave where they had hidden themselves, and put large stones over the mouth of the cave, to this very day.
Joshua	Josh	6	10	28	Now Joshua captured Makkedah on that day, and struck it and its king with the edge of the sword; he utterly destroyed it and every person who was in it. He left no survivor. Thus he did to the king of Makkedah just as he had done to the king of Jericho.
Joshua	Josh	6	10	29	Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Makkedah to Libnah, and fought against Libnah.
Joshua	Josh	6	10	30	The LORD gave it also with its king into the hands of Israel, and he struck it and every person who was in it with the edge of the sword. He left no survivor in it. Thus he did to its king just as he had done to the king of Jericho.
Joshua	Josh	6	10	31	And Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Libnah to Lachish, and they camped by it and fought against it.
Joshua	Josh	6	10	32	The LORD gave Lachish into the hands of Israel; and he captured it on the second day, and struck it and every person who was in it with the edge of the sword, according to all that he had done to Libnah.
Joshua	Josh	6	10	33	Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish, and Joshua defeated him and his people until he had left him no survivor.
Joshua	Josh	6	10	34	And Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Lachish to Eglon, and they camped by it and fought against it.
Joshua	Josh	6	10	35	They captured it on that day and struck it with the edge of the sword; and he utterly destroyed that day every person who was in it, according to all that he had done to Lachish.
Joshua	Josh	6	10	36	Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron, and they fought against it.
Joshua	Josh	6	10	37	They captured it and struck it and its king and all its cities and all the persons who were in it with the edge of the sword. He left no survivor, according to all that he had done to Eglon. And he utterly destroyed it and every person who was in it.
Joshua	Josh	6	10	38	Then Joshua and all Israel with him returned to Debir, and they fought against it.
Joshua	Josh	6	10	39	He captured it and its king and all its cities, and they struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed every person who was in it. He left no survivor. Just as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir and its king, as he had also done to Libnah and its king.
Joshua	Josh	6	10	40	Thus Joshua struck all the land, the hill country and the Negev and the lowland and the slopes and all their kings. He left no survivor, but he utterly destroyed all who breathed, just as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded.
Joshua	Josh	6	10	41	Joshua struck them from Kadesh-barnea even as far as Gaza, and all the country of Goshen even as far as Gibeon.
Joshua	Josh	6	10	42	Joshua captured all these kings and their lands at one time, because the LORD, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.
Joshua	Josh	6	10	43	So Joshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp at Gilgal.
Joshua	Josh	6	11	1	Then it came about, when Jabin king of Hazor heard of it, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon and to the king of Shimron and to the king of Achshaph,
Joshua	Josh	6	11	2	and to the kings who were of the north in the hill country, and in the Arabah--south of Chinneroth and in the lowland and on the heights of Dor on the west--
Joshua	Josh	6	11	3	to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and the Amorite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Jebusite in the hill country, and the Hivite at the foot of Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.
Joshua	Josh	6	11	4	They came out, they and all their armies with them, as many people as the sand that is on the seashore, with very many horses and chariots.
Joshua	Josh	6	11	5	So all of these kings having agreed to meet, came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.
Joshua	Josh	6	11	6	Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid because of them, for tomorrow at this time I will deliver all of them slain before Israel; you shall hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire."
Joshua	Josh	6	11	7	So Joshua and all the people of war with him came upon them suddenly by the waters of Merom, and attacked them.
Joshua	Josh	6	11	8	The LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, so that they defeated them, and pursued them as far as Great Sidon and Misrephoth-maim and the valley of Mizpeh to the east; and they struck them until no survivor was left to them.
Joshua	Josh	6	11	9	Joshua did to them as the LORD had told him; he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire.
Joshua	Josh	6	11	10	Then Joshua turned back at that time, and captured Hazor and struck its king with the sword; for Hazor formerly was the head of all these kingdoms.
Joshua	Josh	6	11	11	They struck every person who was in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them; there was no one left who breathed. And he burned Hazor with fire.
Joshua	Josh	6	11	12	Joshua captured all the cities of these kings, and all their kings, and he struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them; just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded.
Joshua	Josh	6	11	13	However, Israel did not burn any cities that stood on their mounds, except Hazor alone, which Joshua burned.
Joshua	Josh	6	11	14	All the spoil of these cities and the cattle, the sons of Israel took as their plunder; but they struck every man with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them. They left no one who breathed.
Joshua	Josh	6	11	15	Just as the LORD had commanded Moses his servant, so Moses commanded Joshua, and so Joshua did; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD had commanded Moses.
Joshua	Josh	6	11	16	Thus Joshua took all that land: the hill country and all the Negev, all that land of Goshen, the lowland, the Arabah, the hill country of Israel and its lowland
Joshua	Josh	6	11	17	from Mount Halak, that rises toward Seir, even as far as Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon at the foot of Mount Hermon. And he captured all their kings and struck them down and put them to death.
Joshua	Josh	6	11	18	Joshua waged war a long time with all these kings.
Joshua	Josh	6	11	19	There was not a city which made peace with the sons of Israel except the Hivites living in Gibeon; they took them all in battle.
Joshua	Josh	6	11	20	For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, to meet Israel in battle in order that he might utterly destroy them, that they might receive no mercy, but that he might destroy them, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Joshua	Josh	6	11	21	Then Joshua came at that time and cut off the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab and from all the hill country of Judah and from all the hill country of Israel. Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.
Joshua	Josh	6	11	22	There were no Anakim left in the land of the sons of Israel; only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod some remained.
Joshua	Josh	6	11	23	So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD had spoken to Moses, and Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. Thus the land had rest from war.
Joshua	Josh	6	12	1	Now these are the kings of the land whom the sons of Israel defeated, and whose land they possessed beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise, from the valley of the Arnon as far as Mount Hermon, and all the Arabah to the east:
Joshua	Josh	6	12	2	Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, both the middle of the valley and half of Gilead, even as far as the brook Jabbok, the border of the sons of Ammon;
Joshua	Josh	6	12	3	and the Arabah as far as the Sea of Chinneroth toward the east, and as far as the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, eastward toward Beth-jeshimoth, and on the south, at the foot of the slopes of Pisgah;
Joshua	Josh	6	12	4	and the territory of Og king of Bashan, one of the remnant of Rephaim, who lived at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,
Joshua	Josh	6	12	5	and ruled over Mount Hermon and Salecah and all Bashan, as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and half of Gilead, as far as the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.
Joshua	Josh	6	12	6	Moses the servant of the LORD and the sons of Israel defeated them; and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it to the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh as a possession.
Joshua	Josh	6	12	7	Now these are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the sons of Israel defeated beyond the Jordan toward the west, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon even as far as Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir; and Joshua gave it to the tribes of Israel as a possession according to their divisions,
Joshua	Josh	6	12	8	in the hill country, in the lowland, in the Arabah, on the slopes, and in the wilderness, and in the Negev; the Hittite, the Amorite and the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite:
Joshua	Josh	6	12	9	the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;
Joshua	Josh	6	12	10	the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;
Joshua	Josh	6	12	11	the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;
Joshua	Josh	6	12	12	the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;
Joshua	Josh	6	12	13	the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;
Joshua	Josh	6	12	14	the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;
Joshua	Josh	6	12	15	the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;
Joshua	Josh	6	12	16	the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;
Joshua	Josh	6	12	17	the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;
Joshua	Josh	6	12	18	the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one;
Joshua	Josh	6	12	19	the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;
Joshua	Josh	6	12	20	the king of Shimron-meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;
Joshua	Josh	6	12	21	the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;
Joshua	Josh	6	12	22	the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;
Joshua	Josh	6	12	23	the king of Dor in the heights of Dor, one; the king of Goiim in Gilgal, one;
Joshua	Josh	6	12	24	the king of Tirzah, one: in all, thirty-one kings.
Joshua	Josh	6	13	1	Now Joshua was old and advanced in years when the LORD said to him, "You are old and advanced in years, and very much of the land remains to be possessed.
Joshua	Josh	6	13	2	"This is the land that remains: all the regions of the Philistines and all those of the Geshurites;
Joshua	Josh	6	13	3	from the Shihor which is east of Egypt, even as far as the border of Ekron to the north (it is counted as Canaanite); the five lords of the Philistines: the Gazite, the Ashdodite, the Ashkelonite, the Gittite, the Ekronite; and the Avvite
Joshua	Josh	6	13	4	to the south, all the land of the Canaanite, and Mearah that belongs to the Sidonians, as far as Aphek, to the border of the Amorite;
Joshua	Josh	6	13	5	and the land of the Gebalite, and all of Lebanon, toward the east, from Baal-gad below Mount Hermon as far as Lebo-hamath.
Joshua	Josh	6	13	6	"All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon as far as Misrephoth-maim, all the Sidonians, I will drive them out from before the sons of Israel; only allot it to Israel for an inheritance as I have commanded you.
Joshua	Josh	6	13	7	"Now therefore, apportion this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh."
Joshua	Josh	6	13	8	With the other half-tribe, the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance which Moses gave them beyond the Jordan to the east, just as Moses the servant of the LORD gave to them;
Joshua	Josh	6	13	9	from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, with the city which is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain of Medeba, as far as Dibon;
Joshua	Josh	6	13	10	and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, as far as the border of the sons of Ammon;
Joshua	Josh	6	13	11	and Gilead, and the territory of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan as far as Salecah;
Joshua	Josh	6	13	12	all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei (he alone was left of the remnant of the Rephaim); for Moses struck them and dispossessed them.
Joshua	Josh	6	13	13	But the sons of Israel did not dispossess the Geshurites or the Maacathites; for Geshur and Maacath live among Israel until this day.
Joshua	Josh	6	13	14	Only to the tribe of Levi he did not give an inheritance; the offerings by fire to the LORD, the God of Israel, are their inheritance, as He spoke to him.
Joshua	Josh	6	13	15	So Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of the sons of Reuben according to their families.
Joshua	Josh	6	13	16	Their territory was from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, with the city which is in the middle of the valley and all the plain by Medeba;
Joshua	Josh	6	13	17	Heshbon, and all its cities which are on the plain: Dibon and Bamoth-baal and Beth-baal-meon,
Joshua	Josh	6	13	18	and Jahaz and Kedemoth and Mephaath,
Joshua	Josh	6	13	19	and Kiriathaim and Sibmah and Zereth-shahar on the hill of the valley,
Joshua	Josh	6	13	20	and Beth-peor and the slopes of Pisgah and Beth-jeshimoth,
Joshua	Josh	6	13	21	even all the cities of the plain and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses struck with the chiefs of Midian, Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba, the princes of Sihon, who lived in the land.
Joshua	Josh	6	13	22	The sons of Israel also killed Balaam the son of Beor, the diviner, with the sword among the rest of their slain.
Joshua	Josh	6	13	23	The border of the sons of Reuben was the Jordan. This was the inheritance of the sons of Reuben according to their families, the cities and their villages.
Joshua	Josh	6	13	24	Moses also gave an inheritance to the tribe of Gad, to the sons of Gad, according to their families.
Joshua	Josh	6	13	25	Their territory was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the sons of Ammon, as far as Aroer which is before Rabbah;
Joshua	Josh	6	13	26	and from Heshbon as far as Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim, and from Mahanaim as far as the border of Debir;
Joshua	Josh	6	13	27	and in the valley, Beth-haram and Beth-nimrah and Succoth and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, with the Jordan as a border, as far as the lower end of the Sea of Chinnereth beyond the Jordan to the east.
Joshua	Josh	6	13	28	This is the inheritance of the sons of Gad according to their families, the cities and their villages.
Joshua	Josh	6	13	29	Moses also gave an inheritance to the half-tribe of Manasseh; and it was for the half-tribe of the sons of Manasseh according to their families.
Joshua	Josh	6	13	30	Their territory was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, sixty cities;
Joshua	Josh	6	13	31	also half of Gilead, with Ashtaroth and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were for the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh, for half of the sons of Machir according to their families.
Joshua	Josh	6	13	32	These are the territories which Moses apportioned for an inheritance in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan at Jericho to the east.
Joshua	Josh	6	13	33	But to the tribe of Levi, Moses did not give an inheritance; the LORD, the God of Israel, is their inheritance, as He had promised to them.
Joshua	Josh	6	14	1	Now these are the territories which the sons of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the households of the tribes of the sons of Israel apportioned to them for an inheritance,
Joshua	Josh	6	14	2	by the lot of their inheritance, as the LORD commanded through Moses, for the nine tribes and the half-tribe.
Joshua	Josh	6	14	3	For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Jordan; but he did not give an inheritance to the Levites among them.
Joshua	Josh	6	14	4	For the sons of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim, and they did not give a portion to the Levites in the land, except cities to live in, with their pasture lands for their livestock and for their property.
Joshua	Josh	6	14	5	Thus the sons of Israel did just as the LORD had commanded Moses, and they divided the land.
Joshua	Josh	6	14	6	Then the sons of Judah drew near to Joshua in Gilgal, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, "You know the word which the LORD spoke to Moses the man of God concerning you and me in Kadesh-barnea.
Joshua	Josh	6	14	7	"I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land, and I brought word back to him as it was in my heart.
Joshua	Josh	6	14	8	"Nevertheless my brethren who went up with me made the heart of the people melt with fear; but I followed the LORD my God fully.
Joshua	Josh	6	14	9	"So Moses swore on that day, saying, 'Surely the land on which your foot has trodden will be an inheritance to you and to your children forever, because you have followed the LORD my God fully.'
Joshua	Josh	6	14	10	"Now behold, the LORD has let me live, just as He spoke, these forty-five years, from the time that the LORD spoke this word to Moses, when Israel walked in the wilderness; and now behold, I am eighty-five years old today.
Joshua	Josh	6	14	11	"I am still as strong today as I was in the day Moses sent me; as my strength was then, so my strength is now, for war and for going out and coming in.
Joshua	Josh	6	14	12	"Now then, give me this hill country about which the LORD spoke on that day, for you heard on that day that Anakim were there, with great fortified cities; perhaps the LORD will be with me, and I will drive them out as the LORD has spoken."
Joshua	Josh	6	14	13	So Joshua blessed him and gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.
Joshua	Josh	6	14	14	Therefore, Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite until this day, because he followed the LORD God of Israel fully.
Joshua	Josh	6	14	15	Now the name of Hebron was formerly Kiriath-arba; for Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim. Then the land had rest from war.
Joshua	Josh	6	15	1	Now the lot for the tribe of the sons of Judah according to their families reached the border of Edom, southward to the wilderness of Zin at the extreme south.
Joshua	Josh	6	15	2	Their south border was from the lower end of the Salt Sea, from the bay that turns to the south.
Joshua	Josh	6	15	3	Then it proceeded southward to the ascent of Akrabbim and continued to Zin, then went up by the south of Kadesh-barnea and continued to Hezron, and went up to Addar and turned about to Karka.
Joshua	Josh	6	15	4	It continued to Azmon and proceeded to the brook of Egypt, and the border ended at the sea. This shall be your south border.
Joshua	Josh	6	15	5	The east border was the Salt Sea, as far as the mouth of the Jordan. And the border of the north side was from the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan.
Joshua	Josh	6	15	6	Then the border went up to Beth-hoglah, and continued on the north of Beth-arabah, and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben.
Joshua	Josh	6	15	7	The border went up to Debir from the valley of Achor, and turned northward toward Gilgal which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south of the valley; and the border continued to the waters of En-shemesh and it ended at En-rogel.
Joshua	Josh	6	15	8	Then the border went up the valley of Ben-hinnom to the slope of the Jebusite on the south (that is, Jerusalem); and the border went up to the top of the mountain which is before the valley of Hinnom to the west, which is at the end of the valley of Rephaim toward the north.
Joshua	Josh	6	15	9	From the top of the mountain the border curved to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah and proceeded to the cities of Mount Ephron, then the border curved to Baalah (that is, Kiriath-jearim).
Joshua	Josh	6	15	10	The border turned about from Baalah westward to Mount Seir, and continued to the slope of Mount Jearim on the north (that is, Chesalon), and went down to Beth-shemesh and continued through Timnah.
Joshua	Josh	6	15	11	The border proceeded to the side of Ekron northward. Then the border curved to Shikkeron and continued to Mount Baalah and proceeded to Jabneel, and the border ended at the sea.
Joshua	Josh	6	15	12	The west border was at the Great Sea, even its coastline. This is the border around the sons of Judah according to their families.
Joshua	Josh	6	15	13	Now he gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh a portion among the sons of Judah, according to the command of the LORD to Joshua, namely, Kiriath-arba, Arba being the father of Anak (that is, Hebron).
Joshua	Josh	6	15	14	Caleb drove out from there the three sons of Anak: Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai, the children of Anak.
Joshua	Josh	6	15	15	Then he went up from there against the inhabitants of Debir; now the name of Debir formerly was Kiriath-sepher.
Joshua	Josh	6	15	16	And Caleb said, "The one who attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will give him Achsah my daughter as a wife."
Joshua	Josh	6	15	17	Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, captured it; so he gave him Achsah his daughter as a wife.
Joshua	Josh	6	15	18	It came about that when she came to him, she persuaded him to ask her father for a field. So she alighted from the donkey, and Caleb said to her, "What do you want?"
Joshua	Josh	6	15	19	Then she said, "Give me a blessing; since you have given me the land of the Negev, give me also springs of water." So he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
Joshua	Josh	6	15	20	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Judah according to their families.
Joshua	Josh	6	15	21	Now the cities at the extremity of the tribe of the sons of Judah toward the border of Edom in the south were Kabzeel and Eder and Jagur,
Joshua	Josh	6	15	22	and Kinah and Dimonah and Adadah,
Joshua	Josh	6	15	23	and Kedesh and Hazor and Ithnan,
Joshua	Josh	6	15	24	Ziph and Telem and Bealoth,
Joshua	Josh	6	15	25	and Hazor-hadattah and Kerioth-hezron (that is, Hazor),
Joshua	Josh	6	15	26	Amam and Shema and Moladah,
Joshua	Josh	6	15	27	and Hazar-gaddah and Heshmon and Beth-pelet,
Joshua	Josh	6	15	28	and Hazar-shual and Beersheba and Biziothiah,
Joshua	Josh	6	15	29	Baalah and Iim and Ezem,
Joshua	Josh	6	15	30	and Eltolad and Chesil and Hormah,
Joshua	Josh	6	15	31	and Ziklag and Madmannah and Sansannah,
Joshua	Josh	6	15	32	and Lebaoth and Shilhim and Ain and Rimmon; in all, twenty-nine cities with their villages.
Joshua	Josh	6	15	33	In the lowland: Eshtaol and Zorah and Ashnah,
Joshua	Josh	6	15	34	and Zanoah and En-gannim, Tappuah and Enam,
Joshua	Josh	6	15	35	Jarmuth and Adullam, Socoh and Azekah,
Joshua	Josh	6	15	36	and Shaaraim and Adithaim and Gederah and Gederothaim; fourteen cities with their villages.
Joshua	Josh	6	15	37	Zenan and Hadashah and Migdal-gad,
Joshua	Josh	6	15	38	and Dilean and Mizpeh and Joktheel,
Joshua	Josh	6	15	39	Lachish and Bozkath and Eglon,
Joshua	Josh	6	15	40	and Cabbon and Lahmas and Chitlish,
Joshua	Josh	6	15	41	and Gederoth, Beth-dagon and Naamah and Makkedah; sixteen cities with their villages.
Joshua	Josh	6	15	42	Libnah and Ether and Ashan,
Joshua	Josh	6	15	43	and Iphtah and Ashnah and Nezib,
Joshua	Josh	6	15	44	and Keilah and Achzib and Mareshah; nine cities with their villages.
Joshua	Josh	6	15	45	Ekron, with its towns and its villages;
Joshua	Josh	6	15	46	from Ekron even to the sea, all that were by the side of Ashdod, with their villages.
Joshua	Josh	6	15	47	Ashdod, its towns and its villages; Gaza, its towns and its villages; as far as the brook of Egypt and the Great Sea, even its coastline.
Joshua	Josh	6	15	48	In the hill country: Shamir and Jattir and Socoh,
Joshua	Josh	6	15	49	and Dannah and Kiriath-sannah (that is, Debir),
Joshua	Josh	6	15	50	and Anab and Eshtemoh and Anim,
Joshua	Josh	6	15	51	and Goshen and Holon and Giloh; eleven cities with their villages.
Joshua	Josh	6	15	52	Arab and Dumah and Eshan,
Joshua	Josh	6	15	53	and Janum and Beth-tappuah and Aphekah,
Joshua	Josh	6	15	54	and Humtah and Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), and Zior; nine cities with their villages.
Joshua	Josh	6	15	55	Maon, Carmel and Ziph and Juttah,
Joshua	Josh	6	15	56	and Jezreel and Jokdeam and Zanoah,
Joshua	Josh	6	15	57	Kain, Gibeah and Timnah; ten cities with their villages.
Joshua	Josh	6	15	58	Halhul, Beth-zur and Gedor,
Joshua	Josh	6	15	59	and Maarath and Beth-anoth and Eltekon; six cities with their villages.
Joshua	Josh	6	15	60	Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), and Rabbah; two cities with their villages.
Joshua	Josh	6	15	61	In the wilderness: Beth-arabah, Middin and Secacah,
Joshua	Josh	6	15	62	and Nibshan and the City of Salt and Engedi; six cities with their villages.
Joshua	Josh	6	15	63	Now as for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the sons of Judah could not drive them out; so the Jebusites live with the sons of Judah at Jerusalem until this day.
Joshua	Josh	6	16	1	Then the lot for the sons of Joseph went from the Jordan at Jericho to the waters of Jericho on the east into the wilderness, going up from Jericho through the hill country to Bethel.
Joshua	Josh	6	16	2	It went from Bethel to Luz, and continued to the border of the Archites at Ataroth.
Joshua	Josh	6	16	3	It went down westward to the territory of the Japhletites, as far as the territory of lower Beth-horon even to Gezer, and it ended at the sea.
Joshua	Josh	6	16	4	The sons of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, received their inheritance.
Joshua	Josh	6	16	5	Now this was the territory of the sons of Ephraim according to their families: the border of their inheritance eastward was Ataroth-addar, as far as upper Beth-horon.
Joshua	Josh	6	16	6	Then the border went westward at Michmethath on the north, and the border turned about eastward to Taanath-shiloh and continued beyond it to the east of Janoah.
Joshua	Josh	6	16	7	It went down from Janoah to Ataroth and to Naarah, then reached Jericho and came out at the Jordan.
Joshua	Josh	6	16	8	From Tappuah the border continued westward to the brook of Kanah, and it ended at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim according to their families,
Joshua	Josh	6	16	9	together with the cities which were set apart for the sons of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the sons of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.
Joshua	Josh	6	16	10	But they did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, so the Canaanites live in the midst of Ephraim to this day, and they became forced laborers.
Joshua	Josh	6	17	1	Now this was the lot for the tribe of Manasseh, for he was the firstborn of Joseph. To Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, were allotted Gilead and Bashan, because he was a man of war.
Joshua	Josh	6	17	2	So the lot was made for the rest of the sons of Manasseh according to their families: for the sons of Abiezer and for the sons of Helek and for the sons of Asriel and for the sons of Shechem and for the sons of Hepher and for the sons of Shemida; these were the male descendants of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families.
Joshua	Josh	6	17	3	However, Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, only daughters; and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah and Tirzah.
Joshua	Josh	6	17	4	They came near before Eleazar the priest and before Joshua the son of Nun and before the leaders, saying, "The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers." So according to the command of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among their father's brothers.
Joshua	Josh	6	17	5	Thus there fell ten portions to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan,
Joshua	Josh	6	17	6	because the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance among his sons. And the land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the sons of Manasseh.
Joshua	Josh	6	17	7	The border of Manasseh ran from Asher to Michmethath which was east of Shechem; then the border went southward to the inhabitants of En-tappuah.
Joshua	Josh	6	17	8	The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the sons of Ephraim.
Joshua	Josh	6	17	9	The border went down to the brook of Kanah, southward of the brook (these cities belonged to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh), and the border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook and it ended at the sea.
Joshua	Josh	6	17	10	The south side belonged to Ephraim and the north side to Manasseh, and the sea was their border; and they reached to Asher on the north and to Issachar on the east.
Joshua	Josh	6	17	11	In Issachar and in Asher, Manasseh had Beth-shean and its towns and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of En-dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, the third is Napheth.
Joshua	Josh	6	17	12	But the sons of Manasseh could not take possession of these cities, because the Canaanites persisted in living in that land.
Joshua	Josh	6	17	13	It came about when the sons of Israel became strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but they did not drive them out completely.
Joshua	Josh	6	17	14	Then the sons of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, "Why have you given me only one lot and one portion for an inheritance, since I am a numerous people whom the LORD has thus far blessed?"
Joshua	Josh	6	17	15	Joshua said to them, "If you are a numerous people, go up to the forest and clear a place for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim, since the hill country of Ephraim is too narrow for you."
Joshua	Josh	6	17	16	The sons of Joseph said, "The hill country is not enough for us, and all the Canaanites who live in the valley land have chariots of iron, both those who are in Beth-shean and its towns and those who are in the valley of Jezreel."
Joshua	Josh	6	17	17	Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and Manasseh, saying, "You are a numerous people and have great power; you shall not have one lot only,
Joshua	Josh	6	17	18	but the hill country shall be yours. For though it is a forest, you shall clear it, and to its farthest borders it shall be yours; for you shall drive out the Canaanites, even though they have chariots of iron and though they are strong."
Joshua	Josh	6	18	1	Then the whole congregation of the sons of Israel assembled themselves at Shiloh, and set up the tent of meeting there; and the land was subdued before them.
Joshua	Josh	6	18	2	There remained among the sons of Israel seven tribes who had not divided their inheritance.
Joshua	Josh	6	18	3	So Joshua said to the sons of Israel, "How long will you put off entering to take possession of the land which the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you?
Joshua	Josh	6	18	4	"Provide for yourselves three men from each tribe that I may send them, and that they may arise and walk through the land and write a description of it according to their inheritance; then they shall return to me.
Joshua	Josh	6	18	5	"They shall divide it into seven portions; Judah shall stay in its territory on the south, and the house of Joseph shall stay in their territory on the north.
Joshua	Josh	6	18	6	"You shall describe the land in seven divisions, and bring the description here to me. I will cast lots for you here before the LORD our God.
Joshua	Josh	6	18	7	"For the Levites have no portion among you, because the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance. Gad and Reuben and the half-tribe of Manasseh also have received their inheritance eastward beyond the Jordan, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them."
Joshua	Josh	6	18	8	Then the men arose and went, and Joshua commanded those who went to describe the land, saying, "Go and walk through the land and describe it, and return to me; then I will cast lots for you here before the LORD in Shiloh."
Joshua	Josh	6	18	9	So the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities in seven divisions in a book; and they came to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh.
Joshua	Josh	6	18	10	And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD, and there Joshua divided the land to the sons of Israel according to their divisions.
Joshua	Josh	6	18	11	Now the lot of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin came up according to their families, and the territory of their lot lay between the sons of Judah and the sons of Joseph.
Joshua	Josh	6	18	12	Their border on the north side was from the Jordan, then the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north, and went up through the hill country westward, and it ended at the wilderness of Beth-aven.
Joshua	Josh	6	18	13	From there the border continued to Luz, to the side of Luz (that is, Bethel) southward; and the border went down to Ataroth-addar, near the hill which lies on the south of lower Beth-horon.
Joshua	Josh	6	18	14	The border extended from there and turned round on the west side southward, from the hill which lies before Beth-horon southward; and it ended at Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), a city of the sons of Judah. This was the west side.
Joshua	Josh	6	18	15	Then the south side was from the edge of Kiriath-jearim, and the border went westward and went to the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah.
Joshua	Josh	6	18	16	The border went down to the edge of the hill which is in the valley of Ben-hinnom, which is in the valley of Rephaim northward; and it went down to the valley of Hinnom, to the slope of the Jebusite southward, and went down to En-rogel.
Joshua	Josh	6	18	17	It extended northward and went to En-shemesh and went to Geliloth, which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, and it went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben.
Joshua	Josh	6	18	18	It continued to the side in front of the Arabah northward and went down to the Arabah.
Joshua	Josh	6	18	19	The border continued to the side of Beth-hoglah northward; and the border ended at the north bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan. This was the south border.
Joshua	Josh	6	18	20	Moreover, the Jordan was its border on the east side. This was the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin, according to their families and according to its borders all around.
Joshua	Josh	6	18	21	Now the cities of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho and Beth-hoglah and Emek-keziz,
Joshua	Josh	6	18	22	and Beth-arabah and Zemaraim and Bethel,
Joshua	Josh	6	18	23	and Avvim and Parah and Ophrah,
Joshua	Josh	6	18	24	and Chephar-ammoni and Ophni and Geba; twelve cities with their villages.
Joshua	Josh	6	18	25	Gibeon and Ramah and Beeroth,
Joshua	Josh	6	18	26	and Mizpeh and Chephirah and Mozah,
Joshua	Josh	6	18	27	and Rekem and Irpeel and Taralah,
Joshua	Josh	6	18	28	and Zelah, Haeleph and the Jebusite (that is, Jerusalem), Gibeah, Kiriath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin according to their families.
Joshua	Josh	6	19	1	Then the second lot fell to Simeon, to the tribe of the sons of Simeon according to their families, and their inheritance was in the midst of the inheritance of the sons of Judah.
Joshua	Josh	6	19	2	So they had as their inheritance Beersheba or Sheba and Moladah,
Joshua	Josh	6	19	3	and Hazar-shual and Balah and Ezem,
Joshua	Josh	6	19	4	and Eltolad and Bethul and Hormah,
Joshua	Josh	6	19	5	and Ziklag and Beth-marcaboth and Hazar-susah,
Joshua	Josh	6	19	6	and Beth-lebaoth and Sharuhen; thirteen cities with their villages;
Joshua	Josh	6	19	7	Ain, Rimmon and Ether and Ashan; four cities with their villages;
Joshua	Josh	6	19	8	and all the villages which were around these cities as far as Baalath-beer, Ramah of the Negev. This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Simeon according to their families.
Joshua	Josh	6	19	9	The inheritance of the sons of Simeon was taken from the portion of the sons of Judah, for the share of the sons of Judah was too large for them; so the sons of Simeon received an inheritance in the midst of Judah's inheritance.
Joshua	Josh	6	19	10	Now the third lot came up for the sons of Zebulun according to their families. And the territory of their inheritance was as far as Sarid.
Joshua	Josh	6	19	11	Then their border went up to the west and to Maralah, it then touched Dabbesheth and reached to the brook that is before Jokneam.
Joshua	Josh	6	19	12	Then it turned from Sarid to the east toward the sunrise as far as the border of Chisloth-tabor, and it proceeded to Daberath and up to Japhia.
Joshua	Josh	6	19	13	From there it continued eastward toward the sunrise to Gath-hepher, to Eth-kazin, and it proceeded to Rimmon which stretches to Neah.
Joshua	Josh	6	19	14	The border circled around it on the north to Hannathon, and it ended at the valley of Iphtahel.
Joshua	Josh	6	19	15	Included also were Kattah and Nahalal and Shimron and Idalah and Bethlehem; twelve cities with their villages.
Joshua	Josh	6	19	16	This was the inheritance of the sons of Zebulun according to their families, these cities with their villages.
Joshua	Josh	6	19	17	The fourth lot fell to Issachar, to the sons of Issachar according to their families.
Joshua	Josh	6	19	18	Their territory was to Jezreel and included Chesulloth and Shunem,
Joshua	Josh	6	19	19	and Hapharaim and Shion and Anaharath,
Joshua	Josh	6	19	20	and Rabbith and Kishion and Ebez,
Joshua	Josh	6	19	21	and Remeth and En-gannim and En-haddah and Beth-pazzez.
Joshua	Josh	6	19	22	The border reached to Tabor and Shahazumah and Beth-shemesh, and their border ended at the Jordan; sixteen cities with their villages.
Joshua	Josh	6	19	23	This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Issachar according to their families, the cities with their villages.
Joshua	Josh	6	19	24	Now the fifth lot fell to the tribe of the sons of Asher according to their families.
Joshua	Josh	6	19	25	Their territory was Helkath and Hali and Beten and Achshaph,
Joshua	Josh	6	19	26	and Allammelech and Amad and Mishal; and it reached to Carmel on the west and to Shihor-libnath.
Joshua	Josh	6	19	27	It turned toward the east to Beth-dagon and reached to Zebulun, and to the valley of Iphtahel northward to Beth-emek and Neiel; then it proceeded on north to Cabul,
Joshua	Josh	6	19	28	and Ebron and Rehob and Hammon and Kanah, as far as Great Sidon.
Joshua	Josh	6	19	29	The border turned to Ramah and to the fortified city of Tyre; then the border turned to Hosah, and it ended at the sea by the region of Achzib.
Joshua	Josh	6	19	30	Included also were Ummah, and Aphek and Rehob; twenty-two cities with their villages.
Joshua	Josh	6	19	31	This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages.
Joshua	Josh	6	19	32	The sixth lot fell to the sons of Naphtali; to the sons of Naphtali according to their families.
Joshua	Josh	6	19	33	Their border was from Heleph, from the oak in Zaanannim and Adami-nekeb and Jabneel, as far as Lakkum, and it ended at the Jordan.
Joshua	Josh	6	19	34	Then the border turned westward to Aznoth-tabor and proceeded from there to Hukkok; and it reached to Zebulun on the south and touched Asher on the west, and to Judah at the Jordan toward the east.
Joshua	Josh	6	19	35	The fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer and Hammath, Rakkath and Chinnereth,
Joshua	Josh	6	19	36	and Adamah and Ramah and Hazor,
Joshua	Josh	6	19	37	and Kedesh and Edrei and En-hazor,
Joshua	Josh	6	19	38	and Yiron and Migdal-el, Horem and Beth-anath and Beth-shemesh; nineteen cities with their villages.
Joshua	Josh	6	19	39	This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali according to their families, the cities with their villages.
Joshua	Josh	6	19	40	The seventh lot fell to the tribe of the sons of Dan according to their families.
Joshua	Josh	6	19	41	The territory of their inheritance was Zorah and Eshtaol and Ir-shemesh,
Joshua	Josh	6	19	42	and Shaalabbin and Aijalon and Ithlah,
Joshua	Josh	6	19	43	and Elon and Timnah and Ekron,
Joshua	Josh	6	19	44	and Eltekeh and Gibbethon and Baalath,
Joshua	Josh	6	19	45	and Jehud and Bene-berak and Gath-rimmon,
Joshua	Josh	6	19	46	and Me-jarkon and Rakkon, with the territory over against Joppa.
Joshua	Josh	6	19	47	The territory of the sons of Dan proceeded beyond them; for the sons of Dan went up and fought with Leshem and captured it. Then they struck it with the edge of the sword and possessed it and settled in it; and they called Leshem Dan after the name of Dan their father.
Joshua	Josh	6	19	48	This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.
Joshua	Josh	6	19	49	When they finished apportioning the land for inheritance by its borders, the sons of Israel gave an inheritance in their midst to Joshua the son of Nun.
Joshua	Josh	6	19	50	In accordance with the command of the LORD they gave him the city for which he asked, Timnath-serah in the hill country of Ephraim. So he built the city and settled in it.
Joshua	Josh	6	19	51	These are the inheritances which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the households of the tribes of the sons of Israel distributed by lot in Shiloh before the LORD at the doorway of the tent of meeting. So they finished dividing the land.
Joshua	Josh	6	20	1	Then the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying,
Joshua	Josh	6	20	2	"Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'Designate the cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you through Moses,
Joshua	Josh	6	20	3	that the manslayer who kills any person unintentionally, without premeditation, may flee there, and they shall become your refuge from the avenger of blood.
Joshua	Josh	6	20	4	'He shall flee to one of these cities, and shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city and state his case in the hearing of the elders of that city; and they shall take him into the city to them and give him a place, so that he may dwell among them.
Joshua	Josh	6	20	5	'Now if the avenger of blood pursues him, then they shall not deliver the manslayer into his hand, because he struck his neighbor without premeditation and did not hate him beforehand.
Joshua	Josh	6	20	6	'He shall dwell in that city until he stands before the congregation for judgment, until the death of the one who is high priest in those days. Then the manslayer shall return to his own city and to his own house, to the city from which he fled.'"
Joshua	Josh	6	20	7	So they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali and Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the hill country of Judah.
Joshua	Josh	6	20	8	Beyond the Jordan east of Jericho, they designated Bezer in the wilderness on the plain from the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead from the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan from the tribe of Manasseh.
Joshua	Josh	6	20	9	These were the appointed cities for all the sons of Israel and for the stranger who sojourns among them, that whoever kills any person unintentionally may flee there, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood until he stands before the congregation.
Joshua	Josh	6	21	1	Then the heads of households of the Levites approached Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of households of the tribes of the sons of Israel.
Joshua	Josh	6	21	2	They spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, "The LORD commanded through Moses to give us cities to live in, with their pasture lands for our cattle."
Joshua	Josh	6	21	3	So the sons of Israel gave the Levites from their inheritance these cities with their pasture lands, according to the command of the LORD.
Joshua	Josh	6	21	4	Then the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites. And the sons of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites, received thirteen cities by lot from the tribe of Judah and from the tribe of the Simeonites and from the tribe of Benjamin.
Joshua	Josh	6	21	5	The rest of the sons of Kohath received ten cities by lot from the families of the tribe of Ephraim and from the tribe of Dan and from the half-tribe of Manasseh.
Joshua	Josh	6	21	6	The sons of Gershon received thirteen cities by lot from the families of the tribe of Issachar and from the tribe of Asher and from the tribe of Naphtali and from the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan.
Joshua	Josh	6	21	7	The sons of Merari according to their families received twelve cities from the tribe of Reuben and from the tribe of Gad and from the tribe of Zebulun.
Joshua	Josh	6	21	8	Now the sons of Israel gave by lot to the Levites these cities with their pasture lands, as the LORD had commanded through Moses.
Joshua	Josh	6	21	9	They gave these cities which are here mentioned by name from the tribe of the sons of Judah and from the tribe of the sons of Simeon;
Joshua	Josh	6	21	10	and they were for the sons of Aaron, one of the families of the Kohathites, of the sons of Levi, for the lot was theirs first.
Joshua	Josh	6	21	11	Thus they gave them Kiriath-arba, Arba being the father of Anak (that is, Hebron), in the hill country of Judah, with its surrounding pasture lands.
Joshua	Josh	6	21	12	But the fields of the city and its villages they gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as his possession.
Joshua	Josh	6	21	13	So to the sons of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron, the city of refuge for the manslayer, with its pasture lands, and Libnah with its pasture lands,
Joshua	Josh	6	21	14	and Jattir with its pasture lands and Eshtemoa with its pasture lands,
Joshua	Josh	6	21	15	and Holon with its pasture lands and Debir with its pasture lands,
Joshua	Josh	6	21	16	and Ain with its pasture lands and Juttah with its pasture lands and Beth-shemesh with its pasture lands; nine cities from these two tribes.
Joshua	Josh	6	21	17	From the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with its pasture lands, Geba with its pasture lands,
Joshua	Josh	6	21	18	Anathoth with its pasture lands and Almon with its pasture lands; four cities.
Joshua	Josh	6	21	19	All the cities of the sons of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their pasture lands.
Joshua	Josh	6	21	20	Then the cities from the tribe of Ephraim were allotted to the families of the sons of Kohath, the Levites, even to the rest of the sons of Kohath.
Joshua	Josh	6	21	21	They gave them Shechem, the city of refuge for the manslayer, with its pasture lands, in the hill country of Ephraim, and Gezer with its pasture lands,
Joshua	Josh	6	21	22	and Kibzaim with its pasture lands and Beth-horon with its pasture lands; four cities.
Joshua	Josh	6	21	23	From the tribe of Dan, Elteke with its pasture lands, Gibbethon with its pasture lands,
Joshua	Josh	6	21	24	Aijalon with its pasture lands, Gath-rimmon with its pasture lands; four cities.
Joshua	Josh	6	21	25	From the half-tribe of Manasseh, they allotted Taanach with its pasture lands and Gath-rimmon with its pasture lands; two cities.
Joshua	Josh	6	21	26	All the cities with their pasture lands for the families of the rest of the sons of Kohath were ten.
Joshua	Josh	6	21	27	To the sons of Gershon, one of the families of the Levites, from the half-tribe of Manasseh, they gave Golan in Bashan, the city of refuge for the manslayer, with its pasture lands, and Be-eshterah with its pasture lands; two cities.
Joshua	Josh	6	21	28	From the tribe of Issachar, they gave Kishion with its pasture lands, Daberath with its pasture lands,
Joshua	Josh	6	21	29	Jarmuth with its pasture lands, En-gannim with its pasture lands; four cities.
Joshua	Josh	6	21	30	From the tribe of Asher, they gave Mishal with its pasture lands, Abdon with its pasture lands,
Joshua	Josh	6	21	31	Helkath with its pasture lands and Rehob with its pasture lands; four cities.
Joshua	Josh	6	21	32	From the tribe of Naphtali, they gave Kedesh in Galilee, the city of refuge for the manslayer, with its pasture lands and Hammoth-dor with its pasture lands and Kartan with its pasture lands; three cities.
Joshua	Josh	6	21	33	All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities with their pasture lands.
Joshua	Josh	6	21	34	To the families of the sons of Merari, the rest of the Levites, they gave from the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with its pasture lands and Kartah with its pasture lands.
Joshua	Josh	6	21	35	Dimnah with its pasture lands, Nahalal with its pasture lands; four cities.
Joshua	Josh	6	21	36	From the tribe of Reuben, they gave Bezer with its pasture lands and Jahaz with its pasture lands,
Joshua	Josh	6	21	37	Kedemoth with its pasture lands and Mephaath with its pasture lands; four cities.
Joshua	Josh	6	21	38	From the tribe of Gad, they gave Ramoth in Gilead, the city of refuge for the manslayer, with its pasture lands and Mahanaim with its pasture lands,
Joshua	Josh	6	21	39	Heshbon with its pasture lands, Jazer with its pasture lands; four cities in all.
Joshua	Josh	6	21	40	All these were the cities of the sons of Merari according to their families, the rest of the families of the Levites; and their lot was twelve cities.
Joshua	Josh	6	21	41	All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the sons of Israel were forty-eight cities with their pasture lands.
Joshua	Josh	6	21	42	These cities each had its surrounding pasture lands; thus it was with all these cities.
Joshua	Josh	6	21	43	So the LORD gave Israel all the land which He had sworn to give to their fathers, and they possessed it and lived in it.
Joshua	Josh	6	21	44	And the LORD gave them rest on every side, according to all that He had sworn to their fathers, and no one of all their enemies stood before them; the LORD gave all their enemies into their hand.
Joshua	Josh	6	21	45	Not one of the good promises which the LORD had made to the house of Israel failed; all came to pass.
Joshua	Josh	6	22	1	Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh,
Joshua	Josh	6	22	2	and said to them, "You have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, and have listened to my voice in all that I commanded you.
Joshua	Josh	6	22	3	"You have not forsaken your brothers these many days to this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your God.
Joshua	Josh	6	22	4	"And now the LORD your God has given rest to your brothers, as He spoke to them; therefore turn now and go to your tents, to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you beyond the Jordan.
Joshua	Josh	6	22	5	"Only be very careful to observe the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, to love the LORD your God and walk in all His ways and keep His commandments and hold fast to Him and serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul."
Joshua	Josh	6	22	6	So Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their tents.
Joshua	Josh	6	22	7	Now to the one half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given a possession in Bashan, but to the other half Joshua gave a possession among their brothers westward beyond the Jordan. So when Joshua sent them away to their tents, he blessed them,
Joshua	Josh	6	22	8	and said to them, "Return to your tents with great riches and with very much livestock, with silver, gold, bronze, iron, and with very many clothes; divide the spoil of your enemies with your brothers."
Joshua	Josh	6	22	9	The sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned home and departed from the sons of Israel at Shiloh which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead, to the land of their possession which they had possessed, according to the command of the LORD through Moses.
Joshua	Josh	6	22	10	When they came to the region of the Jordan which is in the land of Canaan, the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built an altar there by the Jordan, a large altar in appearance.
Joshua	Josh	6	22	11	And the sons of Israel heard it said, "Behold, the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar at the frontier of the land of Canaan, in the region of the Jordan, on the side belonging to the sons of Israel."
Joshua	Josh	6	22	12	When the sons of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the sons of Israel gathered themselves at Shiloh to go up against them in war.
Joshua	Josh	6	22	13	Then the sons of Israel sent to the sons of Reuben and to the sons of Gad and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,
Joshua	Josh	6	22	14	and with him ten chiefs, one chief for each father's household from each of the tribes of Israel; and each one of them was the head of his father's household among the thousands of Israel.
Joshua	Josh	6	22	15	They came to the sons of Reuben and to the sons of Gad and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them saying,
Joshua	Josh	6	22	16	"Thus says the whole congregation of the LORD, 'What is this unfaithful act which you have committed against the God of Israel, turning away from following the LORD this day, by building yourselves an altar, to rebel against the LORD this day?
Joshua	Josh	6	22	17	'Is not the iniquity of Peor enough for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day, although a plague came on the congregation of the LORD,
Joshua	Josh	6	22	18	that you must turn away this day from following the LORD? If you rebel against the LORD today, He will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel tomorrow.
Joshua	Josh	6	22	19	'If, however, the land of your possession is unclean, then cross into the land of the possession of the LORD, where the LORD'S tabernacle stands, and take possession among us. Only do not rebel against the LORD, or rebel against us by building an altar for yourselves, besides the altar of the LORD our God.
Joshua	Josh	6	22	20	'Did not Achan the son of Zerah act unfaithfully in the things under the ban, and wrath fall on all the congregation of Israel? And that man did not perish alone in his iniquity.'"
Joshua	Josh	6	22	21	Then the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered and spoke to the heads of the families of Israel.
Joshua	Josh	6	22	22	"The Mighty One, God, the LORD, the Mighty One, God, the LORD! He knows, and may Israel itself know. If it was in rebellion, or if in an unfaithful act against the LORD do not save us this day!
Joshua	Josh	6	22	23	"If we have built us an altar to turn away from following the LORD, or if to offer a burnt offering or grain offering on it, or if to offer sacrifices of peace offerings on it, may the LORD Himself require it.
Joshua	Josh	6	22	24	"But truly we have done this out of concern, for a reason, saying, 'In time to come your sons may say to our sons, "What have you to do with the LORD, the God of Israel?
Joshua	Josh	6	22	25	"For the LORD has made the Jordan a border between us and you, you sons of Reuben and sons of Gad; you have no portion in the LORD." So your sons may make our sons stop fearing the LORD.'
Joshua	Josh	6	22	26	"Therefore we said, 'Let us build an altar, not for burnt offering or for sacrifice;
Joshua	Josh	6	22	27	rather it shall be a witness between us and you and between our generations after us, that we are to perform the service of the LORD before Him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices and with our peace offerings, so that your sons will not say to our sons in time to come, "You have no portion in the LORD."'
Joshua	Josh	6	22	28	"Therefore we said, 'It shall also come about if they say this to us or to our generations in time to come, then we shall say, "See the copy of the altar of the LORD which our fathers made, not for burnt offering or for sacrifice; rather it is a witness between us and you."'
Joshua	Josh	6	22	29	"Far be it from us that we should rebel against the LORD and turn away from following the LORD this day, by building an altar for burnt offering, for grain offering or for sacrifice, besides the altar of the LORD our God which is before His tabernacle."
Joshua	Josh	6	22	30	So when Phinehas the priest and the leaders of the congregation, even the heads of the families of Israel who were with him, heard the words which the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the sons of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them.
Joshua	Josh	6	22	31	And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the sons of Reuben and to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Manasseh, "Today we know that the LORD is in our midst, because you have not committed this unfaithful act against the LORD; now you have delivered the sons of Israel from the hand of the LORD."
Joshua	Josh	6	22	32	Then Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest and the leaders returned from the sons of Reuben and from the sons of Gad, from the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan, to the sons of Israel, and brought back word to them.
Joshua	Josh	6	22	33	The word pleased the sons of Israel, and the sons of Israel blessed God; and they did not speak of going up against them in war to destroy the land in which the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad were living.
Joshua	Josh	6	22	34	The sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad called the altar Witness; "For," they said, "it is a witness between us that the LORD is God."
Joshua	Josh	6	23	1	Now it came about after many days, when the LORD had given rest to Israel from all their enemies on every side, and Joshua was old, advanced in years,
Joshua	Josh	6	23	2	that Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders and their heads and their judges and their officers, and said to them, "I am old, advanced in years.
Joshua	Josh	6	23	3	"And you have seen all that the LORD your God has done to all these nations because of you, for the LORD your God is He who has been fighting for you.
Joshua	Josh	6	23	4	"See, I have apportioned to you these nations which remain as an inheritance for your tribes, with all the nations which I have cut off, from the Jordan even to the Great Sea toward the setting of the sun.
Joshua	Josh	6	23	5	"The LORD your God, He will thrust them out from before you and drive them from before you; and you will possess their land, just as the LORD your God promised you.
Joshua	Josh	6	23	6	"Be very firm, then, to keep and do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, so that you may not turn aside from it to the right hand or to the left,
Joshua	Josh	6	23	7	so that you will not associate with these nations, these which remain among you, or mention the name of their gods, or make anyone swear by them, or serve them, or bow down to them.
Joshua	Josh	6	23	8	"But you are to cling to the LORD your God, as you have done to this day.
Joshua	Josh	6	23	9	"For the LORD has driven out great and strong nations from before you; and as for you, no man has stood before you to this day.
Joshua	Josh	6	23	10	"One of your men puts to flight a thousand, for the LORD your God is He who fights for you, just as He promised you.
Joshua	Josh	6	23	11	"So take diligent heed to yourselves to love the LORD your God.
Joshua	Josh	6	23	12	"For if you ever go back and cling to the rest of these nations, these which remain among you, and intermarry with them, so that you associate with them and they with you,
Joshua	Josh	6	23	13	know with certainty that the LORD your God will not continue to drive these nations out from before you; but they will be a snare and a trap to you, and a whip on your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from off this good land which the LORD your God has given you.
Joshua	Josh	6	23	14	"Now behold, today I am going the way of all the earth, and you know in all your hearts and in all your souls that not one word of all the good words which the LORD your God spoke concerning you has failed; all have been fulfilled for you, not one of them has failed.
Joshua	Josh	6	23	15	"It shall come about that just as all the good words which the LORD your God spoke to you have come upon you, so the LORD will bring upon you all the threats, until He has destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God has given you.
Joshua	Josh	6	23	16	"When you transgress the covenant of the LORD your God, which He commanded you, and go and serve other gods and bow down to them, then the anger of the LORD will burn against you, and you will perish quickly from off the good land which He has given you."
Joshua	Josh	6	24	1	Then Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel and for their heads and their judges and their officers; and they presented themselves before God.
Joshua	Josh	6	24	2	Joshua said to all the people, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'From ancient times your fathers lived beyond the River, namely, Terah, the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor, and they served other gods.
Joshua	Josh	6	24	3	'Then I took your father Abraham from beyond the River, and led him through all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his descendants and gave him Isaac.
Joshua	Josh	6	24	4	'To Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau, and to Esau I gave Mount Seir to possess it; but Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt.
Joshua	Josh	6	24	5	'Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt by what I did in its midst; and afterward I brought you out.
Joshua	Josh	6	24	6	'I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and you came to the sea; and Egypt pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea.
Joshua	Josh	6	24	7	'But when they cried out to the LORD, He put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them and covered them; and your own eyes saw what I did in Egypt. And you lived in the wilderness for a long time.
Joshua	Josh	6	24	8	'Then I brought you into the land of the Amorites who lived beyond the Jordan, and they fought with you; and I gave them into your hand, and you took possession of their land when I destroyed them before you.
Joshua	Josh	6	24	9	'Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel, and he sent and summoned Balaam the son of Beor to curse you.
Joshua	Josh	6	24	10	'But I was not willing to listen to Balaam. So he had to bless you, and I delivered you from his hand.
Joshua	Josh	6	24	11	'You crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho; and the citizens of Jericho fought against you, and the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Girgashite, the Hivite and the Jebusite. Thus I gave them into your hand.
Joshua	Josh	6	24	12	'Then I sent the hornet before you and it drove out the two kings of the Amorites from before you, but not by your sword or your bow.
Joshua	Josh	6	24	13	'I gave you a land on which you had not labored, and cities which you had not built, and you have lived in them; you are eating of vineyards and olive groves which you did not plant.'
Joshua	Josh	6	24	14	"Now, therefore, fear the LORD and serve Him in sincerity and truth; and put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River and in Egypt, and serve the LORD.
Joshua	Josh	6	24	15	"If it is disagreeable in your sight to serve the LORD, choose for yourselves today whom you will serve: whether the gods which your fathers served which were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living; but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD."
Joshua	Josh	6	24	16	The people answered and said, "Far be it from us that we should forsake the LORD to serve other gods;
Joshua	Josh	6	24	17	for the LORD our God is He who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and who did these great signs in our sight and preserved us through all the way in which we went and among all the peoples through whose midst we passed.
Joshua	Josh	6	24	18	"The LORD drove out from before us all the peoples, even the Amorites who lived in the land. We also will serve the LORD, for He is our God."
Joshua	Josh	6	24	19	Then Joshua said to the people, "You will not be able to serve the LORD, for He is a holy God. He is a jealous God; He will not forgive your transgression or your sins.
Joshua	Josh	6	24	20	"If you forsake the LORD and serve foreign gods, then He will turn and do you harm and consume you after He has done good to you."
Joshua	Josh	6	24	21	The people said to Joshua, "No, but we will serve the LORD."
Joshua	Josh	6	24	22	Joshua said to the people, "You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen for yourselves the LORD, to serve Him." And they said, "We are witnesses."
Joshua	Josh	6	24	23	"Now therefore, put away the foreign gods which are in your midst, and incline your hearts to the LORD, the God of Israel."
Joshua	Josh	6	24	24	The people said to Joshua, "We will serve the LORD our God and we will obey His voice."
Joshua	Josh	6	24	25	So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and made for them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.
Joshua	Josh	6	24	26	And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God; and he took a large stone and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of the LORD.
Joshua	Josh	6	24	27	Joshua said to all the people, "Behold, this stone shall be for a witness against us, for it has heard all the words of the LORD which He spoke to us; thus it shall be for a witness against you, so that you do not deny your God."
Joshua	Josh	6	24	28	Then Joshua dismissed the people, each to his inheritance.
Joshua	Josh	6	24	29	It came about after these things that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being one hundred and ten years old.
Joshua	Josh	6	24	30	And they buried him in the territory of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north of Mount Gaash.
Joshua	Josh	6	24	31	Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders who survived Joshua, and had known all the deeds of the LORD which He had done for Israel.
Joshua	Josh	6	24	32	Now they buried the bones of Joseph, which the sons of Israel brought up from Egypt, at Shechem, in the piece of ground which Jacob had bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for one hundred pieces of money; and they became the inheritance of Joseph's sons.
Joshua	Josh	6	24	33	And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him at Gibeah of Phinehas his son, which was given him in the hill country of Ephraim.
Judges	Jdgs	7	1	1	Now it came about after the death of Joshua that the sons of Israel inquired of the LORD, saying, "Who shall go up first for us against the Canaanites, to fight against them?"
Judges	Jdgs	7	1	2	The LORD said, "Judah shall go up; behold, I have given the land into his hand."
Judges	Jdgs	7	1	3	Then Judah said to Simeon his brother, "Come up with me into the territory allotted me, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I in turn will go with you into the territory allotted you." So Simeon went with him.
Judges	Jdgs	7	1	4	Judah went up, and the LORD gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hands, and they defeated ten thousand men at Bezek.
Judges	Jdgs	7	1	5	They found Adoni-bezek in Bezek and fought against him, and they defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
Judges	Jdgs	7	1	6	But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and big toes.
Judges	Jdgs	7	1	7	Adoni-bezek said, "Seventy kings with their thumbs and their big toes cut off used to gather up scraps under my table; as I have done, so God has repaid me." So they brought him to Jerusalem and he died there.
Judges	Jdgs	7	1	8	Then the sons of Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it and struck it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire.
Judges	Jdgs	7	1	9	Afterward the sons of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites living in the hill country and in the Negev and in the lowland.
Judges	Jdgs	7	1	10	So Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron (now the name of Hebron formerly was Kiriath-arba); and they struck Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai.
Judges	Jdgs	7	1	11	Then from there he went against the inhabitants of Debir (now the name of Debir formerly was Kiriath-sepher).
Judges	Jdgs	7	1	12	And Caleb said, "The one who attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will even give him my daughter Achsah for a wife."
Judges	Jdgs	7	1	13	Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, captured it; so he gave him his daughter Achsah for a wife.
Judges	Jdgs	7	1	14	Then it came about when she came to him, that she persuaded him to ask her father for a field. Then she alighted from her donkey, and Caleb said to her, "What do you want?"
Judges	Jdgs	7	1	15	She said to him, "Give me a blessing, since you have given me the land of the Negev, give me also springs of water." So Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
Judges	Jdgs	7	1	16	The descendants of the Kenite, Moses' father-in-law, went up from the city of palms with the sons of Judah, to the wilderness of Judah which is in the south of Arad; and they went and lived with the people.
Judges	Jdgs	7	1	17	Then Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they struck the Canaanites living in Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. So the name of the city was called Hormah.
Judges	Jdgs	7	1	18	And Judah took Gaza with its territory and Ashkelon with its territory and Ekron with its territory.
Judges	Jdgs	7	1	19	Now the LORD was with Judah, and they took possession of the hill country; but they could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had iron chariots.
Judges	Jdgs	7	1	20	Then they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had promised; and he drove out from there the three sons of Anak.
Judges	Jdgs	7	1	21	But the sons of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem; so the Jebusites have lived with the sons of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.
Judges	Jdgs	7	1	22	Likewise the house of Joseph went up against Bethel, and the LORD was with them.
Judges	Jdgs	7	1	23	The house of Joseph spied out Bethel (now the name of the city was formerly Luz).
Judges	Jdgs	7	1	24	The spies saw a man coming out of the city and they said to him, "Please show us the entrance to the city and we will treat you kindly."
Judges	Jdgs	7	1	25	So he showed them the entrance to the city, and they struck the city with the edge of the sword, but they let the man and all his family go free.
Judges	Jdgs	7	1	26	The man went into the land of the Hittites and built a city and named it Luz which is its name to this day.
Judges	Jdgs	7	1	27	But Manasseh did not take possession of Beth-shean and its villages, or Taanach and its villages, or the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages; so the Canaanites persisted in living in that land.
Judges	Jdgs	7	1	28	It came about when Israel became strong, that they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but they did not drive them out completely.
Judges	Jdgs	7	1	29	Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites who were living in Gezer; so the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them.
Judges	Jdgs	7	1	30	Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, or the inhabitants of Nahalol; so the Canaanites lived among them and became subject to forced labor.
Judges	Jdgs	7	1	31	Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, or the inhabitants of Sidon, or of Ahlab, or of Achzib, or of Helbah, or of Aphik, or of Rehob.
Judges	Jdgs	7	1	32	So the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out.
Judges	Jdgs	7	1	33	Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, or the inhabitants of Beth-anath, but lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; and the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath became forced labor for them.
Judges	Jdgs	7	1	34	Then the Amorites forced the sons of Dan into the hill country, for they did not allow them to come down to the valley;
Judges	Jdgs	7	1	35	yet the Amorites persisted in living in Mount Heres, in Aijalon and in Shaalbim; but when the power of the house of Joseph grew strong, they became forced labor.
Judges	Jdgs	7	1	36	The border of the Amorites ran from the ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela and upward.
Judges	Jdgs	7	2	1	Now the angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim. And he said, "I brought you up out of Egypt and led you into the land which I have sworn to your fathers; and I said, 'I will never break My covenant with you,
Judges	Jdgs	7	2	2	and as for you, you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you shall tear down their altars.' But you have not obeyed Me; what is this you have done?
Judges	Jdgs	7	2	3	"Therefore I also said, 'I will not drive them out before you; but they will become as thorns in your sides and their gods will be a snare to you.'"
Judges	Jdgs	7	2	4	When the angel of the LORD spoke these words to all the sons of Israel, the people lifted up their voices and wept.
Judges	Jdgs	7	2	5	So they named that place Bochim; and there they sacrificed to the LORD.
Judges	Jdgs	7	2	6	When Joshua had dismissed the people, the sons of Israel went each to his inheritance to possess the land.
Judges	Jdgs	7	2	7	The people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who survived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of the LORD which He had done for Israel.
Judges	Jdgs	7	2	8	Then Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of one hundred and ten.
Judges	Jdgs	7	2	9	And they buried him in the territory of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.
Judges	Jdgs	7	2	10	All that generation also were gathered to their fathers; and there arose another generation after them who did not know the LORD, nor yet the work which He had done for Israel.
Judges	Jdgs	7	2	11	Then the sons of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD and served the Baals,
Judges	Jdgs	7	2	12	and they forsook the LORD, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods from among the gods of the peoples who were around them, and bowed themselves down to them; thus they provoked the LORD to anger.
Judges	Jdgs	7	2	13	So they forsook the LORD and served Baal and the Ashtaroth.
Judges	Jdgs	7	2	14	The anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He gave them into the hands of plunderers who plundered them; and He sold them into the hands of their enemies around them, so that they could no longer stand before their enemies.
Judges	Jdgs	7	2	15	Wherever they went, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had spoken and as the LORD had sworn to them, so that they were severely distressed.
Judges	Jdgs	7	2	16	Then the LORD raised up judges who delivered them from the hands of those who plundered them.
Judges	Jdgs	7	2	17	Yet they did not listen to their judges, for they played the harlot after other gods and bowed themselves down to them. They turned aside quickly from the way in which their fathers had walked in obeying the commandments of the LORD; they did not do as their fathers.
Judges	Jdgs	7	2	18	When the LORD raised up judges for them, the LORD was with the judge and delivered them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for the LORD was moved to pity by their groaning because of those who oppressed and afflicted them.
Judges	Jdgs	7	2	19	But it came about when the judge died, that they would turn back and act more corruptly than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them and bow down to them; they did not abandon their practices or their stubborn ways.
Judges	Jdgs	7	2	20	So the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He said, "Because this nation has transgressed My covenant which I commanded their fathers and has not listened to My voice,
Judges	Jdgs	7	2	21	I also will no longer drive out before them any of the nations which Joshua left when he died,
Judges	Jdgs	7	2	22	in order to test Israel by them, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk in it as their fathers did, or not."
Judges	Jdgs	7	2	23	So the LORD allowed those nations to remain, not driving them out quickly; and He did not give them into the hand of Joshua.
Judges	Jdgs	7	3	1	Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to test Israel by them (that is, all who had not experienced any of the wars of Canaan;
Judges	Jdgs	7	3	2	only in order that the generations of the sons of Israel might be taught war, those who had not experienced it formerly).
Judges	Jdgs	7	3	3	These nations are: the five lords of the Philistines and all the Canaanites and the Sidonians and the Hivites who lived in Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal-hermon as far as Lebo-hamath.
Judges	Jdgs	7	3	4	They were for testing Israel, to find out if they would obey the commandments of the LORD, which He had commanded their fathers through Moses.
Judges	Jdgs	7	3	5	The sons of Israel lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites;
Judges	Jdgs	7	3	6	and they took their daughters for themselves as wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons, and served their gods.
Judges	Jdgs	7	3	7	The sons of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgot the LORD their God and served the Baals and the Asheroth.
Judges	Jdgs	7	3	8	Then the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, so that He sold them into the hands of Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia; and the sons of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years.
Judges	Jdgs	7	3	9	When the sons of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer for the sons of Israel to deliver them, Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.
Judges	Jdgs	7	3	10	The Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel. When he went out to war, the LORD gave Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand, so that he prevailed over Cushan-rishathaim.
Judges	Jdgs	7	3	11	Then the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
Judges	Jdgs	7	3	12	Now the sons of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD. So the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.
Judges	Jdgs	7	3	13	And he gathered to himself the sons of Ammon and Amalek; and he went and defeated Israel, and they possessed the city of the palm trees.
Judges	Jdgs	7	3	14	The sons of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
Judges	Jdgs	7	3	15	But when the sons of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer for them, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a left-handed man. And the sons of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab.
Judges	Jdgs	7	3	16	Ehud made himself a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length, and he bound it on his right thigh under his cloak.
Judges	Jdgs	7	3	17	He presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man.
Judges	Jdgs	7	3	18	It came about when he had finished presenting the tribute, that he sent away the people who had carried the tribute.
Judges	Jdgs	7	3	19	But he himself turned back from the idols which were at Gilgal, and said, "I have a secret message for you, O king." And he said, "Keep silence." And all who attended him left him.
Judges	Jdgs	7	3	20	Ehud came to him while he was sitting alone in his cool roof chamber. And Ehud said, "I have a message from God for you." And he arose from his seat.
Judges	Jdgs	7	3	21	Ehud stretched out his left hand, took the sword from his right thigh and thrust it into his belly.
Judges	Jdgs	7	3	22	The handle also went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not draw the sword out of his belly; and the refuse came out.
Judges	Jdgs	7	3	23	Then Ehud went out into the vestibule and shut the doors of the roof chamber behind him, and locked them.
Judges	Jdgs	7	3	24	When he had gone out, his servants came and looked, and behold, the doors of the roof chamber were locked; and they said, "He is only relieving himself in the cool room."
Judges	Jdgs	7	3	25	They waited until they became anxious; but behold, he did not open the doors of the roof chamber. Therefore they took the key and opened them, and behold, their master had fallen to the floor dead.
Judges	Jdgs	7	3	26	Now Ehud escaped while they were delaying, and he passed by the idols and escaped to Seirah.
Judges	Jdgs	7	3	27	It came about when he had arrived, that he blew the trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim; and the sons of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he was in front of them.
Judges	Jdgs	7	3	28	He said to them, "Pursue them, for the LORD has given your enemies the Moabites into your hands." So they went down after him and seized the fords of the Jordan opposite Moab, and did not allow anyone to cross.
Judges	Jdgs	7	3	29	They struck down at that time about ten thousand Moabites, all robust and valiant men; and no one escaped.
Judges	Jdgs	7	3	30	So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land was undisturbed for eighty years.
Judges	Jdgs	7	3	31	After him came Shamgar the son of Anath, who struck down six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad; and he also saved Israel.
Judges	Jdgs	7	4	1	Then the sons of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, after Ehud died.
Judges	Jdgs	7	4	2	And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; and the commander of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth-hagoyim.
Judges	Jdgs	7	4	3	The sons of Israel cried to the LORD; for he had nine hundred iron chariots, and he oppressed the sons of Israel severely for twenty years.
Judges	Jdgs	7	4	4	Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel at that time.
Judges	Jdgs	7	4	5	She used to sit under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim; and the sons of Israel came up to her for judgment.
Judges	Jdgs	7	4	6	Now she sent and summoned Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedesh-naphtali, and said to him, "Behold, the LORD, the God of Israel, has commanded, 'Go and march to Mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men from the sons of Naphtali and from the sons of Zebulun.
Judges	Jdgs	7	4	7	'I will draw out to you Sisera, the commander of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his many troops to the river Kishon, and I will give him into your hand.'"
Judges	Jdgs	7	4	8	Then Barak said to her, "If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go."
Judges	Jdgs	7	4	9	She said, "I will surely go with you; nevertheless, the honor shall not be yours on the journey that you are about to take, for the LORD will sell Sisera into the hands of a woman." Then Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh.
Judges	Jdgs	7	4	10	Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh, and ten thousand men went up with him; Deborah also went up with him.
Judges	Jdgs	7	4	11	Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, from the sons of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far away as the oak in Zaanannim, which is near Kedesh.
Judges	Jdgs	7	4	12	Then they told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor.
Judges	Jdgs	7	4	13	Sisera called together all his chariots, nine hundred iron chariots, and all the people who were with him, from Harosheth-hagoyim to the river Kishon.
Judges	Jdgs	7	4	14	Deborah said to Barak, "Arise! For this is the day in which the LORD has given Sisera into your hands; behold, the LORD has gone out before you." So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men following him.
Judges	Jdgs	7	4	15	The LORD routed Sisera and all his chariots and all his army with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera alighted from his chariot and fled away on foot.
Judges	Jdgs	7	4	16	But Barak pursued the chariots and the army as far as Harosheth-hagoyim, and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; not even one was left.
Judges	Jdgs	7	4	17	Now Sisera fled away on foot to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite, for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.
Judges	Jdgs	7	4	18	Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, "Turn aside, my master, turn aside to me! Do not be afraid." And he turned aside to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.
Judges	Jdgs	7	4	19	He said to her, "Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty." So she opened a bottle of milk and gave him a drink; then she covered him.
Judges	Jdgs	7	4	20	He said to her, "Stand in the doorway of the tent, and it shall be if anyone comes and inquires of you, and says, 'Is there anyone here?' that you shall say, 'No.'"
Judges	Jdgs	7	4	21	But Jael, Heber's wife, took a tent peg and seized a hammer in her hand, and went secretly to him and drove the peg into his temple, and it went through into the ground; for he was sound asleep and exhausted. So he died.
Judges	Jdgs	7	4	22	And behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him and said to him, "Come, and I will show you the man whom you are seeking." And he entered with her, and behold Sisera was lying dead with the tent peg in his temple.
Judges	Jdgs	7	4	23	So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the sons of Israel.
Judges	Jdgs	7	4	24	The hand of the sons of Israel pressed heavier and heavier upon Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin the king of Canaan.
Judges	Jdgs	7	5	1	Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying,
Judges	Jdgs	7	5	2	"That the leaders led in Israel, That the people volunteered, Bless the LORD!
Judges	Jdgs	7	5	3	"Hear, O kings; give ear, O rulers! I--to the LORD, I will sing, I will sing praise to the LORD, the God of Israel.
Judges	Jdgs	7	5	4	"LORD, when You went out from Seir, When You marched from the field of Edom, The earth quaked, the heavens also dripped, Even the clouds dripped water.
Judges	Jdgs	7	5	5	"The mountains quaked at the presence of the LORD, This Sinai, at the presence of the LORD, the God of Israel.
Judges	Jdgs	7	5	6	"In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, In the days of Jael, the highways were deserted, And travelers went by roundabout ways.
Judges	Jdgs	7	5	7	"The peasantry ceased, they ceased in Israel, Until I, Deborah, arose, Until I arose, a mother in Israel.
Judges	Jdgs	7	5	8	"New gods were chosen; Then war was in the gates. Not a shield or a spear was seen Among forty thousand in Israel.
Judges	Jdgs	7	5	9	"My heart goes out to the commanders of Israel, The volunteers among the people; Bless the LORD!
Judges	Jdgs	7	5	10	"You who ride on white donkeys, You who sit on rich carpets, And you who travel on the road--sing!
Judges	Jdgs	7	5	11	"At the sound of those who divide flocks among the watering places, There they shall recount the righteous deeds of the LORD, The righteous deeds for His peasantry in Israel. Then the people of the LORD went down to the gates.
Judges	Jdgs	7	5	12	"Awake, awake, Deborah; Awake, awake, sing a song! Arise, Barak, and take away your captives, O son of Abinoam.
Judges	Jdgs	7	5	13	"Then survivors came down to the nobles; The people of the LORD came down to me as warriors.
Judges	Jdgs	7	5	14	"From Ephraim those whose root is in Amalek came down, Following you, Benjamin, with your peoples; From Machir commanders came down, And from Zebulun those who wield the staff of office.
Judges	Jdgs	7	5	15	"And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; As was Issachar, so was Barak; Into the valley they rushed at his heels; Among the divisions of Reuben There were great resolves of heart.
Judges	Jdgs	7	5	16	"Why did you sit among the sheepfolds, To hear the piping for the flocks? Among the divisions of Reuben There were great searchings of heart.
Judges	Jdgs	7	5	17	"Gilead remained across the Jordan; And why did Dan stay in ships? Asher sat at the seashore, And remained by its landings.
Judges	Jdgs	7	5	18	"Zebulun was a people who despised their lives even to death, And Naphtali also, on the high places of the field.
Judges	Jdgs	7	5	19	"The kings came and fought; Then fought the kings of Canaan At Taanach near the waters of Megiddo; They took no plunder in silver.
Judges	Jdgs	7	5	20	"The stars fought from heaven, From their courses they fought against Sisera.
Judges	Jdgs	7	5	21	"The torrent of Kishon swept them away, The ancient torrent, the torrent Kishon. O my soul, march on with strength.
Judges	Jdgs	7	5	22	"Then the horses' hoofs beat From the dashing, the dashing of his valiant steeds.
Judges	Jdgs	7	5	23	'Curse Meroz,' said the angel of the LORD, 'Utterly curse its inhabitants; Because they did not come to the help of the LORD, To the help of the LORD against the warriors.'
Judges	Jdgs	7	5	24	"Most blessed of women is Jael, The wife of Heber the Kenite; Most blessed is she of women in the tent.
Judges	Jdgs	7	5	25	"He asked for water and she gave him milk; In a magnificent bowl she brought him curds.
Judges	Jdgs	7	5	26	"She reached out her hand for the tent peg, And her right hand for the workmen's hammer. Then she struck Sisera, she smashed his head; And she shattered and pierced his temple.
Judges	Jdgs	7	5	27	"Between her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay; Between her feet he bowed, he fell; Where he bowed, there he fell dead.
Judges	Jdgs	7	5	28	"Out of the window she looked and lamented, The mother of Sisera through the lattice, 'Why does his chariot delay in coming? Why do the hoofbeats of his chariots tarry?'
Judges	Jdgs	7	5	29	"Her wise princesses would answer her, Indeed she repeats her words to herself,
Judges	Jdgs	7	5	30	'Are they not finding, are they not dividing the spoil? A maiden, two maidens for every warrior; To Sisera a spoil of dyed work, A spoil of dyed work embroidered, Dyed work of double embroidery on the neck of the spoiler?'
Judges	Jdgs	7	5	31	"Thus let all Your enemies perish, O LORD; But let those who love Him be like the rising of the sun in its might." And the land was undisturbed for forty years.
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	1	Then the sons of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD gave them into the hands of Midian seven years.
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	2	The power of Midian prevailed against Israel. Because of Midian the sons of Israel made for themselves the dens which were in the mountains and the caves and the strongholds.
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	3	For it was when Israel had sown, that the Midianites would come up with the Amalekites and the sons of the east and go against them.
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	4	So they would camp against them and destroy the produce of the earth as far as Gaza, and leave no sustenance in Israel as well as no sheep, ox, or donkey.
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	5	For they would come up with their livestock and their tents, they would come in like locusts for number, both they and their camels were innumerable; and they came into the land to devastate it.
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	6	So Israel was brought very low because of Midian, and the sons of Israel cried to the LORD.
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	7	Now it came about when the sons of Israel cried to the LORD on account of Midian,
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	8	that the LORD sent a prophet to the sons of Israel, and he said to them, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'It was I who brought you up from Egypt and brought you out from the house of slavery.
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	9	'I delivered you from the hands of the Egyptians and from the hands of all your oppressors, and dispossessed them before you and gave you their land,
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	10	and I said to you, "I am the LORD your God; you shall not fear the gods of the Amorites in whose land you live. But you have not obeyed Me."'"
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	11	Then the angel of the LORD came and sat under the oak that was in Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite as his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the wine press in order to save it from the Midianites.
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	12	The angel of the LORD appeared to him and said to him, "The LORD is with you, O valiant warrior."
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	13	Then Gideon said to him, "O my lord, if the LORD is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And where are all His miracles which our fathers told us about, saying, 'Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt?' But now the LORD has abandoned us and given us into the hand of Midian."
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	14	The LORD looked at him and said, "Go in this your strength and deliver Israel from the hand of Midian. Have I not sent you?"
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	15	He said to Him, "O Lord, how shall I deliver Israel? Behold, my family is the least in Manasseh, and I am the youngest in my father's house."
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	16	But the LORD said to him, "Surely I will be with you, and you shall defeat Midian as one man."
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	17	So Gideon said to Him, "If now I have found favor in Your sight, then show me a sign that it is You who speak with me.
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	18	"Please do not depart from here, until I come back to You, and bring out my offering and lay it before You." And He said, "I will remain until you return."
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	19	Then Gideon went in and prepared a young goat and unleavened bread from an ephah of flour; he put the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot, and brought them out to him under the oak and presented them.
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	20	The angel of God said to him, "Take the meat and the unleavened bread and lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth." And he did so.
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	21	Then the angel of the LORD put out the end of the staff that was in his hand and touched the meat and the unleavened bread; and fire sprang up from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened bread. Then the angel of the LORD vanished from his sight.
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	22	When Gideon saw that he was the angel of the LORD, he said, "Alas, O Lord GOD! For now I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face."
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	23	The LORD said to him, "Peace to you, do not fear; you shall not die."
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	24	Then Gideon built an altar there to the LORD and named it The LORD is Peace. To this day it is still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	25	Now on the same night the LORD said to him, "Take your father's bull and a second bull seven years old, and pull down the altar of Baal which belongs to your father, and cut down the Asherah that is beside it;
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	26	and build an altar to the LORD your God on the top of this stronghold in an orderly manner, and take a second bull and offer a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah which you shall cut down."
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	27	Then Gideon took ten men of his servants and did as the LORD had spoken to him; and because he was too afraid of his father's household and the men of the city to do it by day, he did it by night.
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	28	When the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was torn down, and the Asherah which was beside it was cut down, and the second bull was offered on the altar which had been built.
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	29	They said to one another, "Who did this thing?" And when they searched about and inquired, they said, "Gideon the son of Joash did this thing."
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	30	Then the men of the city said to Joash, "Bring out your son, that he may die, for he has torn down the altar of Baal, and indeed, he has cut down the Asherah which was beside it."
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	31	But Joash said to all who stood against him, "Will you contend for Baal, or will you deliver him? Whoever will plead for him shall be put to death by morning. If he is a god, let him contend for himself, because someone has torn down his altar."
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	32	Therefore on that day he named him Jerubbaal, that is to say, "Let Baal contend against him," because he had torn down his altar.
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	33	Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the sons of the east assembled themselves; and they crossed over and camped in the valley of Jezreel.
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	34	So the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon; and he blew a trumpet, and the Abiezrites were called together to follow him.
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	35	He sent messengers throughout Manasseh, and they also were called together to follow him; and he sent messengers to Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they came up to meet them.
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	36	Then Gideon said to God, "If You will deliver Israel through me, as You have spoken,
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	37	behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew on the fleece only, and it is dry on all the ground, then I will know that You will deliver Israel through me, as You have spoken."
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	38	And it was so. When he arose early the next morning and squeezed the fleece, he drained the dew from the fleece, a bowl full of water.
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	39	Then Gideon said to God, "Do not let Your anger burn against me that I may speak once more; please let me make a test once more with the fleece, let it now be dry only on the fleece, and let there be dew on all the ground."
Judges	Jdgs	7	6	40	God did so that night; for it was dry only on the fleece, and dew was on all the ground.
Judges	Jdgs	7	7	1	Then Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) and all the people who were with him, rose early and camped beside the spring of Harod; and the camp of Midian was on the north side of them by the hill of Moreh in the valley.
Judges	Jdgs	7	7	2	The LORD said to Gideon, "The people who are with you are too many for Me to give Midian into their hands, for Israel would become boastful, saying, 'My own power has delivered me.'
Judges	Jdgs	7	7	3	"Now therefore come, proclaim in the hearing of the people, saying, 'Whoever is afraid and trembling, let him return and depart from Mount Gilead.'" So 22,people returned, but 10,000 remained.
Judges	Jdgs	7	7	4	Then the LORD said to Gideon, "The people are still too many; bring them down to the water and I will test them for you there. Therefore it shall be that he of whom I say to you, 'This one shall go with you,' he shall go with you; but everyone of whom I say to you, 'This one shall not go with you,' he shall not go."
Judges	Jdgs	7	7	5	So he brought the people down to the water. And the LORD said to Gideon, "You shall separate everyone who laps the water with his tongue as a dog laps, as well as everyone who kneels to drink."
Judges	Jdgs	7	7	6	Now the number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was men; but all the rest of the people kneeled to drink water.
Judges	Jdgs	7	7	7	The LORD said to Gideon, "I will deliver you with the men who lapped and will give the Midianites into your hands; so let all the other people go, each man to his home."
Judges	Jdgs	7	7	8	So the men took the people's provisions and their trumpets into their hands. And Gideon sent all the other men of Israel, each to his tent, but retained the 300 men; and the camp of Midian was below him in the valley.
Judges	Jdgs	7	7	9	Now the same night it came about that the LORD said to him, "Arise, go down against the camp, for I have given it into your hands.
Judges	Jdgs	7	7	10	"But if you are afraid to go down, go with Purah your servant down to the camp,
Judges	Jdgs	7	7	11	and you will hear what they say; and afterward your hands will be strengthened that you may go down against the camp." So he went with Purah his servant down to the outposts of the army that was in the camp.
Judges	Jdgs	7	7	12	Now the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the sons of the east were lying in the valley as numerous as locusts; and their camels were without number, as numerous as the sand on the seashore.
Judges	Jdgs	7	7	13	When Gideon came, behold, a man was relating a dream to his friend. And he said, "Behold, I had a dream; a loaf of barley bread was tumbling into the camp of Midian, and it came to the tent and struck it so that it fell, and turned it upside down so that the tent lay flat."
Judges	Jdgs	7	7	14	His friend replied, "This is nothing less than the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel; God has given Midian and all the camp into his hand."
Judges	Jdgs	7	7	15	When Gideon heard the account of the dream and its interpretation, he bowed in worship. He returned to the camp of Israel and said, "Arise, for the LORD has given the camp of Midian into your hands."
Judges	Jdgs	7	7	16	He divided the men into three companies, and he put trumpets and empty pitchers into the hands of all of them, with torches inside the pitchers.
Judges	Jdgs	7	7	17	He said to them, "Look at me and do likewise. And behold, when I come to the outskirts of the camp, do as I do.
Judges	Jdgs	7	7	18	"When I and all who are with me blow the trumpet, then you also blow the trumpets all around the camp and say, 'For the LORD and for Gideon.'"
Judges	Jdgs	7	7	19	So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the outskirts of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, when they had just posted the watch; and they blew the trumpets and smashed the pitchers that were in their hands.
Judges	Jdgs	7	7	20	When the three companies blew the trumpets and broke the pitchers, they held the torches in their left hands and the trumpets in their right hands for blowing, and cried, "A sword for the LORD and for Gideon!"
Judges	Jdgs	7	7	21	Each stood in his place around the camp; and all the army ran, crying out as they fled.
Judges	Jdgs	7	7	22	When they blew trumpets, the LORD set the sword of one against another even throughout the whole army; and the army fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the edge of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath.
Judges	Jdgs	7	7	23	The men of Israel were summoned from Naphtali and Asher and all Manasseh, and they pursued Midian.
Judges	Jdgs	7	7	24	Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, "Come down against Midian and take the waters before them, as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan." So all the men of Ephraim were summoned and they took the waters as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan.
Judges	Jdgs	7	7	25	They captured the two leaders of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb, and they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and they killed Zeeb at the wine press of Zeeb, while they pursued Midian; and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon from across the Jordan.
Judges	Jdgs	7	8	1	Then the men of Ephraim said to him, "What is this thing you have done to us, not calling us when you went to fight against Midian?" And they contended with him vigorously.
Judges	Jdgs	7	8	2	But he said to them, "What have I done now in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?
Judges	Jdgs	7	8	3	"God has given the leaders of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb into your hands; and what was I able to do in comparison with you?" Then their anger toward him subsided when he said that.
Judges	Jdgs	7	8	4	Then Gideon and the men who were with him came to the Jordan and crossed over, weary yet pursuing.
Judges	Jdgs	7	8	5	He said to the men of Succoth, "Please give loaves of bread to the people who are following me, for they are weary, and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian."
Judges	Jdgs	7	8	6	The leaders of Succoth said, "Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hands, that we should give bread to your army?"
Judges	Jdgs	7	8	7	Gideon said, "All right, when the LORD has given Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will thrash your bodies with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers."
Judges	Jdgs	7	8	8	He went up from there to Penuel and spoke similarly to them; and the men of Penuel answered him just as the men of Succoth had answered.
Judges	Jdgs	7	8	9	So he spoke also to the men of Penuel, saying, "When I return safely, I will tear down this tower."
Judges	Jdgs	7	8	10	Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their armies with them, about 15,men, all who were left of the entire army of the sons of the east; for the fallen were 120,000 swordsmen.
Judges	Jdgs	7	8	11	Gideon went up by the way of those who lived in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and attacked the camp when the camp was unsuspecting.
Judges	Jdgs	7	8	12	When Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued them and captured the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and routed the whole army.
Judges	Jdgs	7	8	13	Then Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle by the ascent of Heres.
Judges	Jdgs	7	8	14	And he captured a youth from Succoth and questioned him. Then the youth wrote down for him the princes of Succoth and its elders, seventy-seven men.
Judges	Jdgs	7	8	15	He came to the men of Succoth and said, "Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, concerning whom you taunted me, saying, 'Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand, that we should give bread to your men who are weary?'"
Judges	Jdgs	7	8	16	He took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and he disciplined the men of Succoth with them.
Judges	Jdgs	7	8	17	He tore down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city.
Judges	Jdgs	7	8	18	Then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, "What kind of men were they whom you killed at Tabor?" And they said, "They were like you, each one resembling the son of a king."
Judges	Jdgs	7	8	19	He said, "They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As the LORD lives, if only you had let them live, I would not kill you."
Judges	Jdgs	7	8	20	So he said to Jether his firstborn, "Rise, kill them." But the youth did not draw his sword, for he was afraid, because he was still a youth.
Judges	Jdgs	7	8	21	Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, "Rise up yourself, and fall on us; for as the man, so is his strength." So Gideon arose and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescent ornaments which were on their camels' necks.
Judges	Jdgs	7	8	22	Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, "Rule over us, both you and your son, also your son's son, for you have delivered us from the hand of Midian."
Judges	Jdgs	7	8	23	But Gideon said to them, "I will not rule over you, nor shall my son rule over you; the LORD shall rule over you."
Judges	Jdgs	7	8	24	Yet Gideon said to them, "I would request of you, that each of you give me an earring from his spoil." (For they had gold earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)
Judges	Jdgs	7	8	25	They said, "We will surely give them." So they spread out a garment, and every one of them threw an earring there from his spoil.
Judges	Jdgs	7	8	26	The weight of the gold earrings that he requested was 1,shekels of gold, besides the crescent ornaments and the pendants and the purple robes which were on the kings of Midian, and besides the neck bands that were on their camels' necks.
Judges	Jdgs	7	8	27	Gideon made it into an ephod, and placed it in his city, Ophrah, and all Israel played the harlot with it there, so that it became a snare to Gideon and his household.
Judges	Jdgs	7	8	28	So Midian was subdued before the sons of Israel, and they did not lift up their heads anymore. And the land was undisturbed for forty years in the days of Gideon.
Judges	Jdgs	7	8	29	Then Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and lived in his own house.
Judges	Jdgs	7	8	30	Now Gideon had seventy sons who were his direct descendants, for he had many wives.
Judges	Jdgs	7	8	31	His concubine who was in Shechem also bore him a son, and he named him Abimelech.
Judges	Jdgs	7	8	32	And Gideon the son of Joash died at a ripe old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
Judges	Jdgs	7	8	33	Then it came about, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the sons of Israel again played the harlot with the Baals, and made Baal-berith their god.
Judges	Jdgs	7	8	34	Thus the sons of Israel did not remember the LORD their God, who had delivered them from the hands of all their enemies on every side;
Judges	Jdgs	7	8	35	nor did they show kindness to the household of Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) in accord with all the good that he had done to Israel.
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	1	And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother's relatives, and spoke to them and to the whole clan of the household of his mother's father, saying,
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	2	"Speak, now, in the hearing of all the leaders of Shechem, 'Which is better for you, that seventy men, all the sons of Jerubbaal, rule over you, or that one man rule over you?' Also, remember that I am your bone and your flesh."
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	3	And his mother's relatives spoke all these words on his behalf in the hearing of all the leaders of Shechem; and they were inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, "He is our relative."
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	4	They gave him seventy pieces of silver from the house of Baal-berith with which Abimelech hired worthless and reckless fellows, and they followed him.
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	5	Then he went to his father's house at Ophrah and killed his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal, seventy men, on one stone. But Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left, for he hid himself.
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	6	All the men of Shechem and all Beth-millo assembled together, and they went and made Abimelech king, by the oak of the pillar which was in Shechem.
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	7	Now when they told Jotham, he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim, and lifted his voice and called out. Thus he said to them, "Listen to me, O men of Shechem, that God may listen to you.
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	8	"Once the trees went forth to anoint a king over them, and they said to the olive tree, 'Reign over us!'
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	9	"But the olive tree said to them, 'Shall I leave my fatness with which God and men are honored, and go to wave over the trees?'
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	10	"Then the trees said to the fig tree, 'You come, reign over us!'
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	11	"But the fig tree said to them, 'Shall I leave my sweetness and my good fruit, and go to wave over the trees?'
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	12	"Then the trees said to the vine, 'You come, reign over us!'
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	13	"But the vine said to them, 'Shall I leave my new wine, which cheers God and men, and go to wave over the trees?'
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	14	"Finally all the trees said to the bramble, 'You come, reign over us!'
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	15	"The bramble said to the trees, 'If in truth you are anointing me as king over you, come and take refuge in my shade; but if not, may fire come out from the bramble and consume the cedars of Lebanon.'
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	16	"Now therefore, if you have dealt in truth and integrity in making Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have dealt with him as he deserved--
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	17	for my father fought for you and risked his life and delivered you from the hand of Midian;
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	18	but you have risen against my father's house today and have killed his sons, seventy men, on one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your relative--
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	19	if then you have dealt in truth and integrity with Jerubbaal and his house this day, rejoice in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you.
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	20	"But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech and consume the men of Shechem and Beth-millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem and from Beth-millo, and consume Abimelech."
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	21	Then Jotham escaped and fled, and went to Beer and remained there because of Abimelech his brother.
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	22	Now Abimelech ruled over Israel three years.
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	23	Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech,
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	24	so that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood might be laid on Abimelech their brother, who killed them, and on the men of Shechem, who strengthened his hands to kill his brothers.
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	25	The men of Shechem set men in ambush against him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all who might pass by them along the road; and it was told to Abimelech.
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	26	Now Gaal the son of Ebed came with his relatives, and crossed over into Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their trust in him.
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	27	They went out into the field and gathered the grapes of their vineyards and trod them, and held a festival; and they went into the house of their god, and ate and drank and cursed Abimelech.
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	28	Then Gaal the son of Ebed said, "Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerubbaal, and is Zebul not his lieutenant? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem; but why should we serve him?
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	29	"Would, therefore, that this people were under my authority! Then I would remove Abimelech." And he said to Abimelech, "Increase your army and come out."
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	30	When Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger burned.
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	31	He sent messengers to Abimelech deceitfully, saying, "Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his relatives have come to Shechem; and behold, they are stirring up the city against you.
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	32	"Now therefore, arise by night, you and the people who are with you, and lie in wait in the field.
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	33	"In the morning, as soon as the sun is up, you shall rise early and rush upon the city; and behold, when he and the people who are with him come out against you, you shall do to them whatever you can."
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	34	So Abimelech and all the people who were with him arose by night and lay in wait against Shechem in four companies.
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	35	Now Gaal the son of Ebed went out and stood in the entrance of the city gate; and Abimelech and the people who were with him arose from the ambush.
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	36	When Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, "Look, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains." But Zebul said to him, "You are seeing the shadow of the mountains as if they were men."
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	37	Gaal spoke again and said, "Behold, people are coming down from the highest part of the land, and one company comes by the way of the diviners' oak."
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	38	Then Zebul said to him, "Where is your boasting now with which you said, 'Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?' Is this not the people whom you despised? Go out now and fight with them!"
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	39	So Gaal went out before the leaders of Shechem and fought with Abimelech.
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	40	Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him; and many fell wounded up to the entrance of the gate.
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	41	Then Abimelech remained at Arumah, but Zebul drove out Gaal and his relatives so that they could not remain in Shechem.
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	42	Now it came about the next day, that the people went out to the field, and it was told to Abimelech.
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	43	So he took his people and divided them into three companies, and lay in wait in the field; when he looked and saw the people coming out from the city, he arose against them and slew them.
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	44	Then Abimelech and the company who was with him dashed forward and stood in the entrance of the city gate; the other two companies then dashed against all who were in the field and slew them.
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	45	Abimelech fought against the city all that day, and he captured the city and killed the people who were in it; then he razed the city and sowed it with salt.
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	46	When all the leaders of the tower of Shechem heard of it, they entered the inner chamber of the temple of El-berith.
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	47	It was told Abimelech that all the leaders of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	48	So Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people who were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand and cut down a branch from the trees, and lifted it and laid it on his shoulder. Then he said to the people who were with him, "What you have seen me do, hurry and do likewise."
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	49	All the people also cut down each one his branch and followed Abimelech, and put them on the inner chamber and set the inner chamber on fire over those inside, so that all the men of the tower of Shechem also died, about a thousand men and women.
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	50	Then Abimelech went to Thebez, and he camped against Thebez and captured it.
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	51	But there was a strong tower in the center of the city, and all the men and women with all the leaders of the city fled there and shut themselves in; and they went up on the roof of the tower.
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	52	So Abimelech came to the tower and fought against it, and approached the entrance of the tower to burn it with fire.
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	53	But a certain woman threw an upper millstone on Abimelech's head, crushing his skull.
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	54	Then he called quickly to the young man, his armor bearer, and said to him, "Draw your sword and kill me, so that it will not be said of me, 'A woman slew him.'" So the young man pierced him through, and he died.
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	55	When the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, each departed to his home.
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	56	Thus God repaid the wickedness of Abimelech, which he had done to his father in killing his seventy brothers.
Judges	Jdgs	7	9	57	Also God returned all the wickedness of the men of Shechem on their heads, and the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal came upon them.
Judges	Jdgs	7	10	1	Now after Abimelech died, Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar, arose to save Israel; and he lived in Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim.
Judges	Jdgs	7	10	2	He judged Israel twenty-three years. Then he died and was buried in Shamir.
Judges	Jdgs	7	10	3	After him, Jair the Gileadite arose and judged Israel twenty-two years.
Judges	Jdgs	7	10	4	He had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkeys, and they had thirty cities in the land of Gilead that are called Havvoth-jair to this day.
Judges	Jdgs	7	10	5	And Jair died and was buried in Kamon.
Judges	Jdgs	7	10	6	Then the sons of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, served the Baals and the Ashtaroth, the gods of Aram, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the sons of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines; thus they forsook the LORD and did not serve Him.
Judges	Jdgs	7	10	7	The anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He sold them into the hands of the Philistines and into the hands of the sons of Ammon.
Judges	Jdgs	7	10	8	They afflicted and crushed the sons of Israel that year; for eighteen years they afflicted all the sons of Israel who were beyond the Jordan in Gilead in the land of the Amorites.
Judges	Jdgs	7	10	9	The sons of Ammon crossed the Jordan to fight also against Judah, Benjamin, and the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was greatly distressed.
Judges	Jdgs	7	10	10	Then the sons of Israel cried out to the LORD, saying, "We have sinned against You, for indeed, we have forsaken our God and served the Baals."
Judges	Jdgs	7	10	11	The LORD said to the sons of Israel, "Did I not deliver you from the Egyptians, the Amorites, the sons of Ammon, and the Philistines?
Judges	Jdgs	7	10	12	"Also when the Sidonians, the Amalekites and the Maonites oppressed you, you cried out to Me, and I delivered you from their hands.
Judges	Jdgs	7	10	13	"Yet you have forsaken Me and served other gods; therefore I will no longer deliver you.
Judges	Jdgs	7	10	14	"Go and cry out to the gods which you have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your distress."
Judges	Jdgs	7	10	15	The sons of Israel said to the LORD, "We have sinned, do to us whatever seems good to You; only please deliver us this day."
Judges	Jdgs	7	10	16	So they put away the foreign gods from among them and served the LORD; and He could bear the misery of Israel no longer.
Judges	Jdgs	7	10	17	Then the sons of Ammon were summoned and they camped in Gilead. And the sons of Israel gathered together and camped in Mizpah.
Judges	Jdgs	7	10	18	The people, the leaders of Gilead, said to one another, "Who is the man who will begin to fight against the sons of Ammon? He shall become head over all the inhabitants of Gilead."
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	1	Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a valiant warrior, but he was the son of a harlot. And Gilead was the father of Jephthah.
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	2	Gilead's wife bore him sons; and when his wife's sons grew up, they drove Jephthah out and said to him, "You shall not have an inheritance in our father's house, for you are the son of another woman."
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	3	So Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob; and worthless fellows gathered themselves about Jephthah, and they went out with him.
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	4	It came about after a while that the sons of Ammon fought against Israel.
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	5	When the sons of Ammon fought against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob;
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	6	and they said to Jephthah, "Come and be our chief that we may fight against the sons of Ammon."
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	7	Then Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, "Did you not hate me and drive me from my father's house? So why have you come to me now when you are in trouble?"
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	8	The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, "For this reason we have now returned to you, that you may go with us and fight with the sons of Ammon and become head over all the inhabitants of Gilead."
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	9	So Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, "If you take me back to fight against the sons of Ammon and the LORD gives them up to me, will I become your head?"
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	10	The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, "The LORD is witness between us; surely we will do as you have said."
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	11	Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and chief over them; and Jephthah spoke all his words before the LORD at Mizpah.
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	12	Now Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the sons of Ammon, saying, "What is between you and me, that you have come to me to fight against my land?"
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	13	The king of the sons of Ammon said to the messengers of Jephthah, "Because Israel took away my land when they came up from Egypt, from the Arnon as far as the Jabbok and the Jordan; therefore, return them peaceably now."
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	14	But Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the sons of Ammon,
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	15	and they said to him, "Thus says Jephthah, 'Israel did not take away the land of Moab nor the land of the sons of Ammon.
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	16	'For when they came up from Egypt, and Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea and came to Kadesh,
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	17	then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, "Please let us pass through your land," but the king of Edom would not listen. And they also sent to the king of Moab, but he would not consent. So Israel remained at Kadesh.
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	18	'Then they went through the wilderness and around the land of Edom and the land of Moab, and came to the east side of the land of Moab, and they camped beyond the Arnon; but they did not enter the territory of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab.
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	19	'And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon, and Israel said to him, "Please let us pass through your land to our place."
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	20	'But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory; so Sihon gathered all his people and camped in Jahaz and fought with Israel.
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	21	'The LORD, the God of Israel, gave Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they defeated them; so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	22	'So they possessed all the territory of the Amorites, from the Arnon as far as the Jabbok, and from the wilderness as far as the Jordan.
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	23	'Since now the LORD, the God of Israel, drove out the Amorites from before His people Israel, are you then to possess it?
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	24	'Do you not possess what Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whatever the LORD our God has driven out before us, we will possess it.
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	25	'Now are you any better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever strive with Israel, or did he ever fight against them?
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	26	'While Israel lived in Heshbon and its villages, and in Aroer and its villages, and in all the cities that are on the banks of the Arnon, three hundred years, why did you not recover them within that time?
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	27	'I therefore have not sinned against you, but you are doing me wrong by making war against me; may the LORD, the Judge, judge today between the sons of Israel and the sons of Ammon.'"
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	28	But the king of the sons of Ammon disregarded the message which Jephthah sent him.
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	29	Now the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, so that he passed through Gilead and Manasseh; then he passed through Mizpah of Gilead, and from Mizpah of Gilead he went on to the sons of Ammon.
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	30	Jephthah made a vow to the LORD and said, "If You will indeed give the sons of Ammon into my hand,
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	31	then it shall be that whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the sons of Ammon, it shall be the LORD'S, and I will offer it up as a burnt offering."
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	32	So Jephthah crossed over to the sons of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD gave them into his hand.
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	33	He struck them with a very great slaughter from Aroer to the entrance of Minnith, twenty cities, and as far as Abel-keramim. So the sons of Ammon were subdued before the sons of Israel.
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	34	When Jephthah came to his house at Mizpah, behold, his daughter was coming out to meet him with tambourines and with dancing. Now she was his one and only child; besides her he had no son or daughter.
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	35	When he saw her, he tore his clothes and said, "Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very low, and you are among those who trouble me; for I have given my word to the LORD, and I cannot take it back."
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	36	So she said to him, "My father, you have given your word to the LORD; do to me as you have said, since the LORD has avenged you of your enemies, the sons of Ammon."
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	37	She said to her father, "Let this thing be done for me; let me alone two months, that I may go to the mountains and weep because of my virginity, I and my companions."
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	38	Then he said, "Go." So he sent her away for two months; and she left with her companions, and wept on the mountains because of her virginity.
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	39	At the end of two months she returned to her father, who did to her according to the vow which he had made; and she had no relations with a man. Thus it became a custom in Israel,
Judges	Jdgs	7	11	40	that the daughters of Israel went yearly to commemorate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in the year.
Judges	Jdgs	7	12	1	Then the men of Ephraim were summoned, and they crossed to Zaphon and said to Jephthah, "Why did you cross over to fight against the sons of Ammon without calling us to go with you? We will burn your house down on you."
Judges	Jdgs	7	12	2	Jephthah said to them, "I and my people were at great strife with the sons of Ammon; when I called you, you did not deliver me from their hand.
Judges	Jdgs	7	12	3	"When I saw that you would not deliver me, I took my life in my hands and crossed over against the sons of Ammon, and the LORD gave them into my hand. Why then have you come up to me this day to fight against me?"
Judges	Jdgs	7	12	4	Then Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead and fought Ephraim; and the men of Gilead defeated Ephraim, because they said, "You are fugitives of Ephraim, O Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim and in the midst of Manasseh."
Judges	Jdgs	7	12	5	The Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan opposite Ephraim. And it happened when any of the fugitives of Ephraim said, "Let me cross over," the men of Gilead would say to him, "Are you an Ephraimite?" If he said, "No,"
Judges	Jdgs	7	12	6	then they would say to him, "Say now, 'Shibboleth.'" But he said, "Sibboleth," for he could not pronounce it correctly. Then they seized him and slew him at the fords of the Jordan. Thus there fell at that time 42,of Ephraim.
Judges	Jdgs	7	12	7	Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.
Judges	Jdgs	7	12	8	Now Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel after him.
Judges	Jdgs	7	12	9	He had thirty sons, and thirty daughters whom he gave in marriage outside the family, and he brought in thirty daughters from outside for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years.
Judges	Jdgs	7	12	10	Then Ibzan died and was buried in Bethlehem.
Judges	Jdgs	7	12	11	Now Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel after him; and he judged Israel ten years.
Judges	Jdgs	7	12	12	Then Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried at Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.
Judges	Jdgs	7	12	13	Now Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel after him.
Judges	Jdgs	7	12	14	He had forty sons and thirty grandsons who rode on seventy donkeys; and he judged Israel eight years.
Judges	Jdgs	7	12	15	Then Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died and was buried at Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.
Judges	Jdgs	7	13	1	Now the sons of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, so that the LORD gave them into the hands of the Philistines forty years.
Judges	Jdgs	7	13	2	There was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren and had borne no children.
Judges	Jdgs	7	13	3	Then the angel of the LORD appeared to the woman and said to her, "Behold now, you are barren and have borne no children, but you shall conceive and give birth to a son.
Judges	Jdgs	7	13	4	"Now therefore, be careful not to drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing.
Judges	Jdgs	7	13	5	"For behold, you shall conceive and give birth to a son, and no razor shall come upon his head, for the boy shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb; and he shall begin to deliver Israel from the hands of the Philistines."
Judges	Jdgs	7	13	6	Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, "A man of God came to me and his appearance was like the appearance of the angel of God, very awesome. And I did not ask him where he came from, nor did he tell me his name.
Judges	Jdgs	7	13	7	"But he said to me, 'Behold, you shall conceive and give birth to a son, and now you shall not drink wine or strong drink nor eat any unclean thing, for the boy shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death.'"
Judges	Jdgs	7	13	8	Then Manoah entreated the LORD and said, "O Lord, please let the man of God whom You have sent come to us again that he may teach us what to do for the boy who is to be born."
Judges	Jdgs	7	13	9	God listened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again to the woman as she was sitting in the field, but Manoah her husband was not with her.
Judges	Jdgs	7	13	10	So the woman ran quickly and told her husband, "Behold, the man who came the other day has appeared to me."
Judges	Jdgs	7	13	11	Then Manoah arose and followed his wife, and when he came to the man he said to him, "Are you the man who spoke to the woman?" And he said, "I am."
Judges	Jdgs	7	13	12	Manoah said, "Now when your words come to pass, what shall be the boy's mode of life and his vocation?"
Judges	Jdgs	7	13	13	So the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, "Let the woman pay attention to all that I said.
Judges	Jdgs	7	13	14	"She should not eat anything that comes from the vine nor drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing; let her observe all that I commanded."
Judges	Jdgs	7	13	15	Then Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, "Please let us detain you so that we may prepare a young goat for you."
Judges	Jdgs	7	13	16	The angel of the LORD said to Manoah, "Though you detain me, I will not eat your food, but if you prepare a burnt offering, then offer it to the LORD." For Manoah did not know that he was the angel of the LORD.
Judges	Jdgs	7	13	17	Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, "What is your name, so that when your words come to pass, we may honor you?"
Judges	Jdgs	7	13	18	But the angel of the LORD said to him, "Why do you ask my name, seeing it is wonderful?"
Judges	Jdgs	7	13	19	So Manoah took the young goat with the grain offering and offered it on the rock to the LORD, and He performed wonders while Manoah and his wife looked on.
Judges	Jdgs	7	13	20	For it came about when the flame went up from the altar toward heaven, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. When Manoah and his wife saw this, they fell on their faces to the ground.
Judges	Jdgs	7	13	21	Now the angel of the LORD did not appear to Manoah or his wife again. Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of the LORD.
Judges	Jdgs	7	13	22	So Manoah said to his wife, "We will surely die, for we have seen God."
Judges	Jdgs	7	13	23	But his wife said to him, "If the LORD had desired to kill us, He would not have accepted a burnt offering and a grain offering from our hands, nor would He have shown us all these things, nor would He have let us hear things like this at this time."
Judges	Jdgs	7	13	24	Then the woman gave birth to a son and named him Samson; and the child grew up and the LORD blessed him.
Judges	Jdgs	7	13	25	And the Spirit of the LORD began to stir him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.
Judges	Jdgs	7	14	1	Then Samson went down to Timnah and saw a woman in Timnah, one of the daughters of the Philistines.
Judges	Jdgs	7	14	2	So he came back and told his father and mother, "I saw a woman in Timnah, one of the daughters of the Philistines; now therefore, get her for me as a wife."
Judges	Jdgs	7	14	3	Then his father and his mother said to him, "Is there no woman among the daughters of your relatives, or among all our people, that you go to take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?" But Samson said to his father, "Get her for me, for she looks good to me."
Judges	Jdgs	7	14	4	However, his father and mother did not know that it was of the LORD, for He was seeking an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines were ruling over Israel.
Judges	Jdgs	7	14	5	Then Samson went down to Timnah with his father and mother, and came as far as the vineyards of Timnah; and behold, a young lion came roaring toward him.
Judges	Jdgs	7	14	6	The Spirit of the LORD came upon him mightily, so that he tore him as one tears a young goat though he had nothing in his hand; but he did not tell his father or mother what he had done.
Judges	Jdgs	7	14	7	So he went down and talked to the woman; and she looked good to Samson.
Judges	Jdgs	7	14	8	When he returned later to take her, he turned aside to look at the carcass of the lion; and behold, a swarm of bees and honey were in the body of the lion.
Judges	Jdgs	7	14	9	So he scraped the honey into his hands and went on, eating as he went. When he came to his father and mother, he gave some to them and they ate it; but he did not tell them that he had scraped the honey out of the body of the lion.
Judges	Jdgs	7	14	10	Then his father went down to the woman; and Samson made a feast there, for the young men customarily did this.
Judges	Jdgs	7	14	11	When they saw him, they brought thirty companions to be with him.
Judges	Jdgs	7	14	12	Then Samson said to them, "Let me now propound a riddle to you; if you will indeed tell it to me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen wraps and thirty changes of clothes.
Judges	Jdgs	7	14	13	"But if you are unable to tell me, then you shall give me thirty linen wraps and thirty changes of clothes." And they said to him, "Propound your riddle, that we may hear it."
Judges	Jdgs	7	14	14	So he said to them, "Out of the eater came something to eat, And out of the strong came something sweet." But they could not tell the riddle in three days.
Judges	Jdgs	7	14	15	Then it came about on the fourth day that they said to Samson's wife, "Entice your husband, so that he will tell us the riddle, or we will burn you and your father's house with fire. Have you invited us to impoverish us? Is this not so?"
Judges	Jdgs	7	14	16	Samson's wife wept before him and said, "You only hate me, and you do not love me; you have propounded a riddle to the sons of my people, and have not told it to me." And he said to her, "Behold, I have not told it to my father or mother; so should I tell you?"
Judges	Jdgs	7	14	17	However she wept before him seven days while their feast lasted. And on the seventh day he told her because she pressed him so hard. She then told the riddle to the sons of her people.
Judges	Jdgs	7	14	18	So the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, "What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion?" And he said to them, "If you had not plowed with my heifer, You would not have found out my riddle."
Judges	Jdgs	7	14	19	Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon him mightily, and he went down to Ashkelon and killed thirty of them and took their spoil and gave the changes of clothes to those who told the riddle. And his anger burned, and he went up to his father's house.
Judges	Jdgs	7	14	20	But Samson's wife was given to his companion who had been his friend.
Judges	Jdgs	7	15	1	But after a while, in the time of wheat harvest, Samson visited his wife with a young goat, and said, "I will go in to my wife in her room." But her father did not let him enter.
Judges	Jdgs	7	15	2	Her father said, "I really thought that you hated her intensely; so I gave her to your companion. Is not her younger sister more beautiful than she? Please let her be yours instead."
Judges	Jdgs	7	15	3	Samson then said to them, "This time I shall be blameless in regard to the Philistines when I do them harm."
Judges	Jdgs	7	15	4	Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took torches, and turned the foxes tail to tail and put one torch in the middle between two tails.
Judges	Jdgs	7	15	5	When he had set fire to the torches, he released the foxes into the standing grain of the Philistines, thus burning up both the shocks and the standing grain, along with the vineyards and groves.
Judges	Jdgs	7	15	6	Then the Philistines said, "Who did this?" And they said, "Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he took his wife and gave her to his companion." So the Philistines came up and burned her and her father with fire.
Judges	Jdgs	7	15	7	Samson said to them, "Since you act like this, I will surely take revenge on you, but after that I will quit."
Judges	Jdgs	7	15	8	He struck them ruthlessly with a great slaughter; and he went down and lived in the cleft of the rock of Etam.
Judges	Jdgs	7	15	9	Then the Philistines went up and camped in Judah, and spread out in Lehi.
Judges	Jdgs	7	15	10	The men of Judah said, "Why have you come up against us?" And they said, "We have come up to bind Samson in order to do to him as he did to us."
Judges	Jdgs	7	15	11	Then 3,men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam and said to Samson, "Do you not know that the Philistines are rulers over us? What then is this that you have done to us?" And he said to them, "As they did to me, so I have done to them."
Judges	Jdgs	7	15	12	They said to him, "We have come down to bind you so that we may give you into the hands of the Philistines." And Samson said to them, "Swear to me that you will not kill me."
Judges	Jdgs	7	15	13	So they said to him, "No, but we will bind you fast and give you into their hands; yet surely we will not kill you." Then they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock.
Judges	Jdgs	7	15	14	When he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him. And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him mightily so that the ropes that were on his arms were as flax that is burned with fire, and his bonds dropped from his hands.
Judges	Jdgs	7	15	15	He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, so he reached out and took it and killed a thousand men with it.
Judges	Jdgs	7	15	16	Then Samson said, "With the jawbone of a donkey, Heaps upon heaps, With the jawbone of a donkey I have killed a thousand men."
Judges	Jdgs	7	15	17	When he had finished speaking, he threw the jawbone from his hand; and he named that place Ramath-lehi.
Judges	Jdgs	7	15	18	Then he became very thirsty, and he called to the LORD and said, "You have given this great deliverance by the hand of Your servant, and now shall I die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?"
Judges	Jdgs	7	15	19	But God split the hollow place that is in Lehi so that water came out of it. When he drank, his strength returned and he revived. Therefore he named it En-hakkore, which is in Lehi to this day.
Judges	Jdgs	7	15	20	So he judged Israel twenty years in the days of the Philistines.
Judges	Jdgs	7	16	1	Now Samson went to Gaza and saw a harlot there, and went in to her.
Judges	Jdgs	7	16	2	When it was told to the Gazites, saying, "Samson has come here," they surrounded the place and lay in wait for him all night at the gate of the city. And they kept silent all night, saying, "Let us wait until the morning light, then we will kill him."
Judges	Jdgs	7	16	3	Now Samson lay until midnight, and at midnight he arose and took hold of the doors of the city gate and the two posts and pulled them up along with the bars; then he put them on his shoulders and carried them up to the top of the mountain which is opposite Hebron.
Judges	Jdgs	7	16	4	After this it came about that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.
Judges	Jdgs	7	16	5	The lords of the Philistines came up to her and said to her, "Entice him, and see where his great strength lies and how we may overpower him that we may bind him to afflict him. Then we will each give you eleven hundred pieces of silver."
Judges	Jdgs	7	16	6	So Delilah said to Samson, "Please tell me where your great strength is and how you may be bound to afflict you."
Judges	Jdgs	7	16	7	Samson said to her, "If they bind me with seven fresh cords that have not been dried, then I will become weak and be like any other man."
Judges	Jdgs	7	16	8	Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven fresh cords that had not been dried, and she bound him with them.
Judges	Jdgs	7	16	9	Now she had men lying in wait in an inner room. And she said to him, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" But he snapped the cords as a string of tow snaps when it touches fire. So his strength was not discovered.
Judges	Jdgs	7	16	10	Then Delilah said to Samson, "Behold, you have deceived me and told me lies; now please tell me how you may be bound."
Judges	Jdgs	7	16	11	He said to her, "If they bind me tightly with new ropes which have not been used, then I will become weak and be like any other man."
Judges	Jdgs	7	16	12	So Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them and said to him, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" For the men were lying in wait in the inner room. But he snapped the ropes from his arms like a thread.
Judges	Jdgs	7	16	13	Then Delilah said to Samson, "Up to now you have deceived me and told me lies; tell me how you may be bound." And he said to her, "If you weave the seven locks of my hair with the web [and fasten it with a pin, then I will become weak and be like any other man."
Judges	Jdgs	7	16	14	So while he slept, Delilah took the seven locks of his hair and wove them into the web]. And she fastened it with the pin and said to him, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" But he awoke from his sleep and pulled out the pin of the loom and the web.
Judges	Jdgs	7	16	15	Then she said to him, "How can you say, 'I love you,' when your heart is not with me? You have deceived me these three times and have not told me where your great strength is."
Judges	Jdgs	7	16	16	It came about when she pressed him daily with her words and urged him, that his soul was annoyed to death.
Judges	Jdgs	7	16	17	So he told her all that was in his heart and said to her, "A razor has never come on my head, for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother's womb. If I am shaved, then my strength will leave me and I will become weak and be like any other man."
Judges	Jdgs	7	16	18	When Delilah saw that he had told her all that was in his heart, she sent and called the lords of the Philistines, saying, "Come up once more, for he has told me all that is in his heart." Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her and brought the money in their hands.
Judges	Jdgs	7	16	19	She made him sleep on her knees, and called for a man and had him shave off the seven locks of his hair. Then she began to afflict him, and his strength left him.
Judges	Jdgs	7	16	20	She said, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" And he awoke from his sleep and said, "I will go out as at other times and shake myself free." But he did not know that the LORD had departed from him.
Judges	Jdgs	7	16	21	Then the Philistines seized him and gouged out his eyes; and they brought him down to Gaza and bound him with bronze chains, and he was a grinder in the prison.
Judges	Jdgs	7	16	22	However, the hair of his head began to grow again after it was shaved off.
Judges	Jdgs	7	16	23	Now the lords of the Philistines assembled to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice, for they said, "Our god has given Samson our enemy into our hands."
Judges	Jdgs	7	16	24	When the people saw him, they praised their god, for they said, "Our god has given our enemy into our hands, Even the destroyer of our country, Who has slain many of us."
Judges	Jdgs	7	16	25	It so happened when they were in high spirits, that they said, "Call for Samson, that he may amuse us." So they called for Samson from the prison, and he entertained them. And they made him stand between the pillars.
Judges	Jdgs	7	16	26	Then Samson said to the boy who was holding his hand, "Let me feel the pillars on which the house rests, that I may lean against them."
Judges	Jdgs	7	16	27	Now the house was full of men and women, and all the lords of the Philistines were there. And about 3,men and women were on the roof looking on while Samson was amusing them.
Judges	Jdgs	7	16	28	Then Samson called to the LORD and said, "O Lord GOD, please remember me and please strengthen me just this time, O God, that I may at once be avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes."
Judges	Jdgs	7	16	29	Samson grasped the two middle pillars on which the house rested, and braced himself against them, the one with his right hand and the other with his left.
Judges	Jdgs	7	16	30	And Samson said, "Let me die with the Philistines!" And he bent with all his might so that the house fell on the lords and all the people who were in it. So the dead whom he killed at his death were more than those whom he killed in his life.
Judges	Jdgs	7	16	31	Then his brothers and all his father's household came down, took him, brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of Manoah his father. Thus he had judged Israel twenty years.
Judges	Jdgs	7	17	1	Now there was a man of the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Micah.
Judges	Jdgs	7	17	2	He said to his mother, "The eleven hundred pieces of silver which were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse in my hearing, behold, the silver is with me; I took it." And his mother said, "Blessed be my son by the LORD."
Judges	Jdgs	7	17	3	He then returned the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother, and his mother said, "I wholly dedicate the silver from my hand to the LORD for my son to make a graven image and a molten image; now therefore, I will return them to you."
Judges	Jdgs	7	17	4	So when he returned the silver to his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver and gave them to the silversmith who made them into a graven image and a molten image, and they were in the house of Micah.
Judges	Jdgs	7	17	5	And the man Micah had a shrine and he made an ephod and household idols and consecrated one of his sons, that he might become his priest.
Judges	Jdgs	7	17	6	In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes.
Judges	Jdgs	7	17	7	Now there was a young man from Bethlehem in Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he was staying there.
Judges	Jdgs	7	17	8	Then the man departed from the city, from Bethlehem in Judah, to stay wherever he might find a place; and as he made his journey, he came to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah.
Judges	Jdgs	7	17	9	Micah said to him, "Where do you come from?" And he said to him, "I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to stay wherever I may find a place."
Judges	Jdgs	7	17	10	Micah then said to him, "Dwell with me and be a father and a priest to me, and I will give you ten pieces of silver a year, a suit of clothes, and your maintenance." So the Levite went in.
Judges	Jdgs	7	17	11	The Levite agreed to live with the man, and the young man became to him like one of his sons.
Judges	Jdgs	7	17	12	So Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest and lived in the house of Micah.
Judges	Jdgs	7	17	13	Then Micah said, "Now I know that the LORD will prosper me, seeing I have a Levite as priest."
Judges	Jdgs	7	18	1	In those days there was no king of Israel; and in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking an inheritance for themselves to live in, for until that day an inheritance had not been allotted to them as a possession among the tribes of Israel.
Judges	Jdgs	7	18	2	So the sons of Dan sent from their family five men out of their whole number, valiant men from Zorah and Eshtaol, to spy out the land and to search it; and they said to them, "Go, search the land." And they came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there.
Judges	Jdgs	7	18	3	When they were near the house of Micah, they recognized the voice of the young man, the Levite; and they turned aside there and said to him, "Who brought you here? And what are you doing in this place? And what do you have here?"
Judges	Jdgs	7	18	4	He said to them, "Thus and so has Micah done to me, and he has hired me and I have become his priest."
Judges	Jdgs	7	18	5	They said to him, "Inquire of God, please, that we may know whether our way on which we are going will be prosperous."
Judges	Jdgs	7	18	6	The priest said to them, "Go in peace; your way in which you are going has the LORD'S approval."
Judges	Jdgs	7	18	7	Then the five men departed and came to Laish and saw the people who were in it living in security, after the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and secure; for there was no ruler humiliating them for anything in the land, and they were far from the Sidonians and had no dealings with anyone.
Judges	Jdgs	7	18	8	When they came back to their brothers at Zorah and Eshtaol, their brothers said to them, "What do you report?"
Judges	Jdgs	7	18	9	They said, "Arise, and let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good. And will you sit still? Do not delay to go, to enter, to possess the land.
Judges	Jdgs	7	18	10	"When you enter, you will come to a secure people with a spacious land; for God has given it into your hand, a place where there is no lack of anything that is on the earth."
Judges	Jdgs	7	18	11	Then from the family of the Danites, from Zorah and from Eshtaol, six hundred men armed with weapons of war set out.
Judges	Jdgs	7	18	12	They went up and camped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah. Therefore they called that place Mahaneh-dan to this day; behold, it is west of Kiriath-jearim.
Judges	Jdgs	7	18	13	They passed from there to the hill country of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah.
Judges	Jdgs	7	18	14	Then the five men who went to spy out the country of Laish said to their kinsmen, "Do you know that there are in these houses an ephod and household idols and a graven image and a molten image? Now therefore, consider what you should do."
Judges	Jdgs	7	18	15	They turned aside there and came to the house of the young man, the Levite, to the house of Micah, and asked him of his welfare.
Judges	Jdgs	7	18	16	The six hundred men armed with their weapons of war, who were of the sons of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate.
Judges	Jdgs	7	18	17	Now the five men who went to spy out the land went up and entered there, and took the graven image and the ephod and household idols and the molten image, while the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men armed with weapons of war.
Judges	Jdgs	7	18	18	When these went into Micah's house and took the graven image, the ephod and household idols and the molten image, the priest said to them, "What are you doing?"
Judges	Jdgs	7	18	19	They said to him, "Be silent, put your hand over your mouth and come with us, and be to us a father and a priest. Is it better for you to be a priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?"
Judges	Jdgs	7	18	20	The priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod and household idols and the graven image and went among the people.
Judges	Jdgs	7	18	21	Then they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the livestock and the valuables in front of them.
Judges	Jdgs	7	18	22	When they had gone some distance from the house of Micah, the men who were in the houses near Micah's house assembled and overtook the sons of Dan.
Judges	Jdgs	7	18	23	They cried to the sons of Dan, who turned around and said to Micah, "What is the matter with you, that you have assembled together?"
Judges	Jdgs	7	18	24	He said, "You have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and have gone away, and what do I have besides? So how can you say to me, 'What is the matter with you?'"
Judges	Jdgs	7	18	25	The sons of Dan said to him, "Do not let your voice be heard among us, or else fierce men will fall upon you and you will lose your life, with the lives of your household."
Judges	Jdgs	7	18	26	So the sons of Dan went on their way; and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house.
Judges	Jdgs	7	18	27	Then they took what Micah had made and the priest who had belonged to him, and came to Laish, to a people quiet and secure, and struck them with the edge of the sword; and they burned the city with fire.
Judges	Jdgs	7	18	28	And there was no one to deliver them, because it was far from Sidon and they had no dealings with anyone, and it was in the valley which is near Beth-rehob. And they rebuilt the city and lived in it.
Judges	Jdgs	7	18	29	They called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father who was born in Israel; however, the name of the city formerly was Laish.
Judges	Jdgs	7	18	30	The sons of Dan set up for themselves the graven image; and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land.
Judges	Jdgs	7	18	31	So they set up for themselves Micah's graven image which he had made, all the time that the house of God was at Shiloh.
Judges	Jdgs	7	19	1	Now it came about in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite staying in the remote part of the hill country of Ephraim, who took a concubine for himself from Bethlehem in Judah.
Judges	Jdgs	7	19	2	But his concubine played the harlot against him, and she went away from him to her father's house in Bethlehem in Judah, and was there for a period of four months.
Judges	Jdgs	7	19	3	Then her husband arose and went after her to speak tenderly to her in order to bring her back, taking with him his servant and a pair of donkeys. So she brought him into her father's house, and when the girl's father saw him, he was glad to meet him.
Judges	Jdgs	7	19	4	His father-in-law, the girl's father, detained him; and he remained with him three days. So they ate and drank and lodged there.
Judges	Jdgs	7	19	5	Now on the fourth day they got up early in the morning, and he prepared to go; and the girl's father said to his son-in-law, "Sustain yourself with a piece of bread, and afterward you may go."
Judges	Jdgs	7	19	6	So both of them sat down and ate and drank together; and the girl's father said to the man, "Please be willing to spend the night, and let your heart be merry."
Judges	Jdgs	7	19	7	Then the man arose to go, but his father-in-law urged him so that he spent the night there again.
Judges	Jdgs	7	19	8	On the fifth day he arose to go early in the morning, and the girl's father said, "Please sustain yourself, and wait until afternoon"; so both of them ate.
Judges	Jdgs	7	19	9	When the man arose to go along with his concubine and servant, his father-in-law, the girl's father, said to him, "Behold now, the day has drawn to a close; please spend the night. Lo, the day is coming to an end; spend the night here that your heart may be merry. Then tomorrow you may arise early for your journey so that you may go home."
Judges	Jdgs	7	19	10	But the man was not willing to spend the night, so he arose and departed and came to a place opposite Jebus (that is, Jerusalem). And there were with him a pair of saddled donkeys; his concubine also was with him.
Judges	Jdgs	7	19	11	When they were near Jebus, the day was almost gone; and the servant said to his master, "Please come, and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites and spend the night in it."
Judges	Jdgs	7	19	12	However, his master said to him, "We will not turn aside into the city of foreigners who are not of the sons of Israel; but we will go on as far as Gibeah."
Judges	Jdgs	7	19	13	He said to his servant, "Come and let us approach one of these places; and we will spend the night in Gibeah or Ramah."
Judges	Jdgs	7	19	14	So they passed along and went their way, and the sun set on them near Gibeah which belongs to Benjamin.
Judges	Jdgs	7	19	15	They turned aside there in order to enter and lodge in Gibeah. When they entered, they sat down in the open square of the city, for no one took them into his house to spend the night.
Judges	Jdgs	7	19	16	Then behold, an old man was coming out of the field from his work at evening. Now the man was from the hill country of Ephraim, and he was staying in Gibeah, but the men of the place were Benjamites.
Judges	Jdgs	7	19	17	And he lifted up his eyes and saw the traveler in the open square of the city; and the old man said, "Where are you going, and where do you come from?"
Judges	Jdgs	7	19	18	He said to him, "We are passing from Bethlehem in Judah to the remote part of the hill country of Ephraim, for I am from there, and I went to Bethlehem in Judah. But I am now going to my house, and no man will take me into his house.
Judges	Jdgs	7	19	19	"Yet there is both straw and fodder for our donkeys, and also bread and wine for me, your maidservant, and the young man who is with your servants; there is no lack of anything."
Judges	Jdgs	7	19	20	The old man said, "Peace to you. Only let me take care of all your needs; however, do not spend the night in the open square."
Judges	Jdgs	7	19	21	So he took him into his house and gave the donkeys fodder, and they washed their feet and ate and drank.
Judges	Jdgs	7	19	22	While they were celebrating, behold, the men of the city, certain worthless fellows, surrounded the house, pounding the door; and they spoke to the owner of the house, the old man, saying, "Bring out the man who came into your house that we may have relations with him."
Judges	Jdgs	7	19	23	Then the man, the owner of the house, went out to them and said to them, "No, my fellows, please do not act so wickedly; since this man has come into my house, do not commit this act of folly.
Judges	Jdgs	7	19	24	"Here is my virgin daughter and his concubine. Please let me bring them out that you may ravish them and do to them whatever you wish. But do not commit such an act of folly against this man."
Judges	Jdgs	7	19	25	But the men would not listen to him. So the man seized his concubine and brought her out to them; and they raped her and abused her all night until morning, then let her go at the approach of dawn.
Judges	Jdgs	7	19	26	As the day began to dawn, the woman came and fell down at the doorway of the man's house where her master was, until full daylight.
Judges	Jdgs	7	19	27	When her master arose in the morning and opened the doors of the house and went out to go on his way, then behold, his concubine was lying at the doorway of the house with her hands on the threshold.
Judges	Jdgs	7	19	28	He said to her, "Get up and let us go," but there was no answer. Then he placed her on the donkey; and the man arose and went to his home.
Judges	Jdgs	7	19	29	When he entered his house, he took a knife and laid hold of his concubine and cut her in twelve pieces, limb by limb, and sent her throughout the territory of Israel.
Judges	Jdgs	7	19	30	All who saw it said, "Nothing like this has ever happened or been seen from the day when the sons of Israel came up from the land of Egypt to this day. Consider it, take counsel and speak up!"
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	1	Then all the sons of Israel from Dan to Beersheba, including the land of Gilead, came out, and the congregation assembled as one man to the LORD at Mizpah.
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	2	The chiefs of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, took their stand in the assembly of the people of God, 400,foot soldiers who drew the sword.
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	3	(Now the sons of Benjamin heard that the sons of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) And the sons of Israel said, "Tell us, how did this wickedness take place?"
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	4	So the Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered and said, "I came with my concubine to spend the night at Gibeah which belongs to Benjamin.
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	5	"But the men of Gibeah rose up against me and surrounded the house at night because of me. They intended to kill me; instead, they ravished my concubine so that she died.
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	6	"And I took hold of my concubine and cut her in pieces and sent her throughout the land of Israel's inheritance; for they have committed a lewd and disgraceful act in Israel.
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	7	"Behold, all you sons of Israel, give your advice and counsel here."
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	8	Then all the people arose as one man, saying, "Not one of us will go to his tent, nor will any of us return to his house.
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	9	"But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we will go up against it by lot.
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	10	"And we will take men out of 100 throughout the tribes of Israel, and 100 out of 1,000, and 1,000 out of 10,000 to supply food for the people, that when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, they may punish them for all the disgraceful acts that they have committed in Israel."
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	11	Thus all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, united as one man.
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	12	Then the tribes of Israel sent men through the entire tribe of Benjamin, saying, "What is this wickedness that has taken place among you?
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	13	"Now then, deliver up the men, the worthless fellows in Gibeah, that we may put them to death and remove this wickedness from Israel." But the sons of Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers, the sons of Israel.
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	14	The sons of Benjamin gathered from the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against the sons of Israel.
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	15	From the cities on that day the sons of Benjamin were numbered, 26,men who draw the sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah who were numbered, 700 choice men.
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	16	Out of all these people choice men were left-handed; each one could sling a stone at a hair and not miss.
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	17	Then the men of Israel besides Benjamin were numbered, 400,men who draw the sword; all these were men of war.
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	18	Now the sons of Israel arose, went up to Bethel, and inquired of God and said, "Who shall go up first for us to battle against the sons of Benjamin?" Then the LORD said, "Judah shall go up first."
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	19	So the sons of Israel arose in the morning and camped against Gibeah.
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	20	The men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin, and the men of Israel arrayed for battle against them at Gibeah.
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	21	Then the sons of Benjamin came out of Gibeah and felled to the ground on that day 22,men of Israel.
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	22	But the people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves and arrayed for battle again in the place where they had arrayed themselves the first day.
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	23	The sons of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until evening, and inquired of the LORD, saying, "Shall we again draw near for battle against the sons of my brother Benjamin?" And the LORD said, "Go up against him."
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	24	Then the sons of Israel came against the sons of Benjamin the second day.
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	25	Benjamin went out against them from Gibeah the second day and felled to the ground again 18,men of the sons of Israel; all these drew the sword.
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	26	Then all the sons of Israel and all the people went up and came to Bethel and wept; thus they remained there before the LORD and fasted that day until evening. And they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	27	The sons of Israel inquired of the LORD (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	28	and Phinehas the son of Eleazar, Aaron's son, stood before it to minister in those days), saying, "Shall I yet again go out to battle against the sons of my brother Benjamin, or shall I cease?" And the LORD said, "Go up, for tomorrow I will deliver them into your hand."
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	29	So Israel set men in ambush around Gibeah.
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	30	The sons of Israel went up against the sons of Benjamin on the third day and arrayed themselves against Gibeah as at other times.
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	31	The sons of Benjamin went out against the people and were drawn away from the city, and they began to strike and kill some of the people as at other times, on the highways, one of which goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah, and in the field, about thirty men of Israel.
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	32	The sons of Benjamin said, "They are struck down before us, as at the first." But the sons of Israel said, "Let us flee that we may draw them away from the city to the highways."
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	33	Then all the men of Israel arose from their place and arrayed themselves at Baal-tamar; and the men of Israel in ambush broke out of their place, even out of Maareh-geba.
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	34	When ten thousand choice men from all Israel came against Gibeah, the battle became fierce; but Benjamin did not know that disaster was close to them.
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	35	And the LORD struck Benjamin before Israel, so that the sons of Israel destroyed 25,men of Benjamin that day, all who draw the sword.
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	36	So the sons of Benjamin saw that they were defeated. When the men of Israel gave ground to Benjamin because they relied on the men in ambush whom they had set against Gibeah,
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	37	the men in ambush hurried and rushed against Gibeah; the men in ambush also deployed and struck all the city with the edge of the sword.
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	38	Now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the men in ambush was that they would make a great cloud of smoke rise from the city.
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	39	Then the men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began to strike and kill about thirty men of Israel, for they said, "Surely they are defeated before us, as in the first battle."
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	40	But when the cloud began to rise from the city in a column of smoke, Benjamin looked behind them; and behold, the whole city was going up in smoke to heaven.
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	41	Then the men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were terrified; for they saw that disaster was close to them.
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	42	Therefore, they turned their backs before the men of Israel toward the direction of the wilderness, but the battle overtook them while those who came out of the cities destroyed them in the midst of them.
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	43	They surrounded Benjamin, pursued them without rest and trod them down opposite Gibeah toward the east.
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	44	Thus 18,men of Benjamin fell; all these were valiant warriors.
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	45	The rest turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, but they caught 5,of them on the highways and overtook them at Gidom and killed 2,000 of them.
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	46	So all of Benjamin who fell that day were 25,men who draw the sword; all these were valiant warriors.
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	47	But men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and they remained at the rock of Rimmon four months.
Judges	Jdgs	7	20	48	The men of Israel then turned back against the sons of Benjamin and struck them with the edge of the sword, both the entire city with the cattle and all that they found; they also set on fire all the cities which they found.
Judges	Jdgs	7	21	1	Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying, "None of us shall give his daughter to Benjamin in marriage."
Judges	Jdgs	7	21	2	So the people came to Bethel and sat there before God until evening, and lifted up their voices and wept bitterly.
Judges	Jdgs	7	21	3	They said, "Why, O LORD, God of Israel, has this come about in Israel, so that one tribe should be missing today in Israel?"
Judges	Jdgs	7	21	4	It came about the next day that the people arose early and built an altar there and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.
Judges	Jdgs	7	21	5	Then the sons of Israel said, "Who is there among all the tribes of Israel who did not come up in the assembly to the LORD?" For they had taken a great oath concerning him who did not come up to the LORD at Mizpah, saying, "He shall surely be put to death."
Judges	Jdgs	7	21	6	And the sons of Israel were sorry for their brother Benjamin and said, "One tribe is cut off from Israel today.
Judges	Jdgs	7	21	7	"What shall we do for wives for those who are left, since we have sworn by the LORD not to give them any of our daughters in marriage?"
Judges	Jdgs	7	21	8	And they said, "What one is there of the tribes of Israel who did not come up to the LORD at Mizpah?" And behold, no one had come to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly.
Judges	Jdgs	7	21	9	For when the people were numbered, behold, not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead was there.
Judges	Jdgs	7	21	10	And the congregation sent 12,of the valiant warriors there, and commanded them, saying, "Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones.
Judges	Jdgs	7	21	11	"This is the thing that you shall do: you shall utterly destroy every man and every woman who has lain with a man."
Judges	Jdgs	7	21	12	And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead young virgins who had not known a man by lying with him; and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
Judges	Jdgs	7	21	13	Then the whole congregation sent word and spoke to the sons of Benjamin who were at the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace to them.
Judges	Jdgs	7	21	14	Benjamin returned at that time, and they gave them the women whom they had kept alive from the women of Jabesh-gilead; yet they were not enough for them.
Judges	Jdgs	7	21	15	And the people were sorry for Benjamin because the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
Judges	Jdgs	7	21	16	Then the elders of the congregation said, "What shall we do for wives for those who are left, since the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?"
Judges	Jdgs	7	21	17	They said, "There must be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, so that a tribe will not be blotted out from Israel.
Judges	Jdgs	7	21	18	"But we cannot give them wives of our daughters." For the sons of Israel had sworn, saying, "Cursed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin."
Judges	Jdgs	7	21	19	So they said, "Behold, there is a feast of the LORD from year to year in Shiloh, which is on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south side of Lebonah."
Judges	Jdgs	7	21	20	And they commanded the sons of Benjamin, saying, "Go and lie in wait in the vineyards,
Judges	Jdgs	7	21	21	and watch; and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to take part in the dances, then you shall come out of the vineyards and each of you shall catch his wife from the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.
Judges	Jdgs	7	21	22	"It shall come about, when their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, that we shall say to them, 'Give them to us voluntarily, because we did not take for each man of Benjamin a wife in battle, nor did you give them to them, else you would now be guilty.'"
Judges	Jdgs	7	21	23	The sons of Benjamin did so, and took wives according to their number from those who danced, whom they carried away. And they went and returned to their inheritance and rebuilt the cities and lived in them.
Judges	Jdgs	7	21	24	The sons of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and family, and each one of them went out from there to his inheritance.
Judges	Jdgs	7	21	25	In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes.
Ruth	Ruth	8	1	1	Now it came about in the days when the judges governed, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem in Judah went to sojourn in the land of Moab with his wife and his two sons.
Ruth	Ruth	8	1	2	The name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife, Naomi; and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem in Judah. Now they entered the land of Moab and remained there.
Ruth	Ruth	8	1	3	Then Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died; and she was left with her two sons.
Ruth	Ruth	8	1	4	They took for themselves Moabite women as wives; the name of the one was Orpah and the name of the other Ruth. And they lived there about ten years.
Ruth	Ruth	8	1	5	Then both Mahlon and Chilion also died, and the woman was bereft of her two children and her husband.
Ruth	Ruth	8	1	6	Then she arose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the land of Moab, for she had heard in the land of Moab that the LORD had visited His people in giving them food.
Ruth	Ruth	8	1	7	So she departed from the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.
Ruth	Ruth	8	1	8	And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, "Go, return each of you to her mother's house. May the LORD deal kindly with you as you have dealt with the dead and with me.
Ruth	Ruth	8	1	9	"May the LORD grant that you may find rest, each in the house of her husband." Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices and wept.
Ruth	Ruth	8	1	10	And they said to her, "No, but we will surely return with you to your people."
Ruth	Ruth	8	1	11	But Naomi said, "Return, my daughters. Why should you go with me? Have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?
Ruth	Ruth	8	1	12	"Return, my daughters! Go, for I am too old to have a husband. If I said I have hope, if I should even have a husband tonight and also bear sons,
Ruth	Ruth	8	1	13	would you therefore wait until they were grown? Would you therefore refrain from marrying? No, my daughters; for it is harder for me than for you, for the hand of the LORD has gone forth against me."
Ruth	Ruth	8	1	14	And they lifted up their voices and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her.
Ruth	Ruth	8	1	15	Then she said, "Behold, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and her gods; return after your sister-in-law."
Ruth	Ruth	8	1	16	But Ruth said, "Do not urge me to leave you or turn back from following you; for where you go, I will go, and where you lodge, I will lodge. Your people shall be my people, and your God, my God.
Ruth	Ruth	8	1	17	"Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. Thus may the LORD do to me, and worse, if anything but death parts you and me."
Ruth	Ruth	8	1	18	When she saw that she was determined to go with her, she said no more to her.
Ruth	Ruth	8	1	19	So they both went until they came to Bethlehem. And when they had come to Bethlehem, all the city was stirred because of them, and the women said, "Is this Naomi?"
Ruth	Ruth	8	1	20	She said to them, "Do not call me Naomi; call me Mara, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.
Ruth	Ruth	8	1	21	"I went out full, but the LORD has brought me back empty. Why do you call me Naomi, since the LORD has witnessed against me and the Almighty has afflicted me?"
Ruth	Ruth	8	1	22	So Naomi returned, and with her Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, who returned from the land of Moab. And they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of barley harvest.
Ruth	Ruth	8	2	1	Now Naomi had a kinsman of her husband, a man of great wealth, of the family of Elimelech, whose name was Boaz.
Ruth	Ruth	8	2	2	And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, "Please let me go to the field and glean among the ears of grain after one in whose sight I may find favor." And she said to her, "Go, my daughter."
Ruth	Ruth	8	2	3	So she departed and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.
Ruth	Ruth	8	2	4	Now behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the reapers, "May the LORD be with you." And they said to him, "May the LORD bless you."
Ruth	Ruth	8	2	5	Then Boaz said to his servant who was in charge of the reapers, "Whose young woman is this?"
Ruth	Ruth	8	2	6	The servant in charge of the reapers replied, "She is the young Moabite woman who returned with Naomi from the land of Moab.
Ruth	Ruth	8	2	7	"And she said, 'Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.' Thus she came and has remained from the morning until now; she has been sitting in the house for a little while."
Ruth	Ruth	8	2	8	Then Boaz said to Ruth, "Listen carefully, my daughter. Do not go to glean in another field; furthermore, do not go on from this one, but stay here with my maids.
Ruth	Ruth	8	2	9	"Let your eyes be on the field which they reap, and go after them. Indeed, I have commanded the servants not to touch you. When you are thirsty, go to the water jars and drink from what the servants draw."
Ruth	Ruth	8	2	10	Then she fell on her face, bowing to the ground and said to him, "Why have I found favor in your sight that you should take notice of me, since I am a foreigner?"
Ruth	Ruth	8	2	11	Boaz replied to her, "All that you have done for your mother-in-law after the death of your husband has been fully reported to me, and how you left your father and your mother and the land of your birth, and came to a people that you did not previously know.
Ruth	Ruth	8	2	12	"May the LORD reward your work, and your wages be full from the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to seek refuge."
Ruth	Ruth	8	2	13	Then she said, "I have found favor in your sight, my lord, for you have comforted me and indeed have spoken kindly to your maidservant, though I am not like one of your maidservants."
Ruth	Ruth	8	2	14	At mealtime Boaz said to her, "Come here, that you may eat of the bread and dip your piece of bread in the vinegar." So she sat beside the reapers; and he served her roasted grain, and she ate and was satisfied and had some left.
Ruth	Ruth	8	2	15	When she rose to glean, Boaz commanded his servants, saying, "Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not insult her.
Ruth	Ruth	8	2	16	"Also you shall purposely pull out for her some grain from the bundles and leave it that she may glean, and do not rebuke her."
Ruth	Ruth	8	2	17	So she gleaned in the field until evening. Then she beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.
Ruth	Ruth	8	2	18	She took it up and went into the city, and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. She also took it out and gave Naomi what she had left after she was satisfied.
Ruth	Ruth	8	2	19	Her mother-in-law then said to her, "Where did you glean today and where did you work? May he who took notice of you be blessed." So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked and said, "The name of the man with whom I worked today is Boaz."
Ruth	Ruth	8	2	20	Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, "May he be blessed of the LORD who has not withdrawn his kindness to the living and to the dead." Again Naomi said to her, "The man is our relative, he is one of our closest relatives."
Ruth	Ruth	8	2	21	Then Ruth the Moabitess said, "Furthermore, he said to me, 'You should stay close to my servants until they have finished all my harvest.'"
Ruth	Ruth	8	2	22	Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, "It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maids, so that others do not fall upon you in another field."
Ruth	Ruth	8	2	23	So she stayed close by the maids of Boaz in order to glean until the end of the barley harvest and the wheat harvest. And she lived with her mother-in-law.
Ruth	Ruth	8	3	1	Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, "My daughter, shall I not seek security for you, that it may be well with you?
Ruth	Ruth	8	3	2	"Now is not Boaz our kinsman, with whose maids you were? Behold, he winnows barley at the threshing floor tonight.
Ruth	Ruth	8	3	3	"Wash yourself therefore, and anoint yourself and put on your best clothes, and go down to the threshing floor; but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.
Ruth	Ruth	8	3	4	"It shall be when he lies down, that you shall notice the place where he lies, and you shall go and uncover his feet and lie down; then he will tell you what you shall do."
Ruth	Ruth	8	3	5	She said to her, "All that you say I will do."
Ruth	Ruth	8	3	6	So she went down to the threshing floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law had commanded her.
Ruth	Ruth	8	3	7	When Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain; and she came secretly, and uncovered his feet and lay down.
Ruth	Ruth	8	3	8	It happened in the middle of the night that the man was startled and bent forward; and behold, a woman was lying at his feet.
Ruth	Ruth	8	3	9	He said, "Who are you?" And she answered, "I am Ruth your maid. So spread your covering over your maid, for you are a close relative."
Ruth	Ruth	8	3	10	Then he said, "May you be blessed of the LORD, my daughter. You have shown your last kindness to be better than the first by not going after young men, whether poor or rich.
Ruth	Ruth	8	3	11	"Now, my daughter, do not fear. I will do for you whatever you ask, for all my people in the city know that you are a woman of excellence.
Ruth	Ruth	8	3	12	"Now it is true I am a close relative; however, there is a relative closer than I.
Ruth	Ruth	8	3	13	"Remain this night, and when morning comes, if he will redeem you, good; let him redeem you. But if he does not wish to redeem you, then I will redeem you, as the LORD lives. Lie down until morning."
Ruth	Ruth	8	3	14	So she lay at his feet until morning and rose before one could recognize another; and he said, "Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor."
Ruth	Ruth	8	3	15	Again he said, "Give me the cloak that is on you and hold it." So she held it, and he measured six measures of barley and laid it on her. Then she went into the city.
Ruth	Ruth	8	3	16	When she came to her mother-in-law, she said, "How did it go, my daughter?" And she told her all that the man had done for her.
Ruth	Ruth	8	3	17	She said, "These six measures of barley he gave to me, for he said, 'Do not go to your mother-in-law empty-handed.'"
Ruth	Ruth	8	3	18	Then she said, "Wait, my daughter, until you know how the matter turns out; for the man will not rest until he has settled it today."
Ruth	Ruth	8	4	1	Now Boaz went up to the gate and sat down there, and behold, the close relative of whom Boaz spoke was passing by, so he said, "Turn aside, friend, sit down here." And he turned aside and sat down.
Ruth	Ruth	8	4	2	He took ten men of the elders of the city and said, "Sit down here." So they sat down.
Ruth	Ruth	8	4	3	Then he said to the closest relative, "Naomi, who has come back from the land of Moab, has to sell the piece of land which belonged to our brother Elimelech.
Ruth	Ruth	8	4	4	"So I thought to inform you, saying, 'Buy it before those who are sitting here, and before the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it; but if not, tell me that I may know; for there is no one but you to redeem it, and I am after you.'" And he said, "I will redeem it."
Ruth	Ruth	8	4	5	Then Boaz said, "On the day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you must also acquire Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of the deceased, in order to raise up the name of the deceased on his inheritance."
Ruth	Ruth	8	4	6	The closest relative said, "I cannot redeem it for myself, because I would jeopardize my own inheritance. Redeem it for yourself; you may have my right of redemption, for I cannot redeem it."
Ruth	Ruth	8	4	7	Now this was the custom in former times in Israel concerning the redemption and the exchange of land to confirm any matter: a man removed his sandal and gave it to another; and this was the manner of attestation in Israel.
Ruth	Ruth	8	4	8	So the closest relative said to Boaz, "Buy it for yourself." And he removed his sandal.
Ruth	Ruth	8	4	9	Then Boaz said to the elders and all the people, "You are witnesses today that I have bought from the hand of Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech and all that belonged to Chilion and Mahlon.
Ruth	Ruth	8	4	10	"Moreover, I have acquired Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of Mahlon, to be my wife in order to raise up the name of the deceased on his inheritance, so that the name of the deceased will not be cut off from his brothers or from the court of his birth place; you are witnesses today."
Ruth	Ruth	8	4	11	All the people who were in the court, and the elders, said, "We are witnesses. May the LORD make the woman who is coming into your home like Rachel and Leah, both of whom built the house of Israel; and may you achieve wealth in Ephrathah and become famous in Bethlehem.
Ruth	Ruth	8	4	12	"Moreover, may your house be like the house of Perez whom Tamar bore to Judah, through the offspring which the LORD will give you by this young woman."
Ruth	Ruth	8	4	13	So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife, and he went in to her. And the LORD enabled her to conceive, and she gave birth to a son.
Ruth	Ruth	8	4	14	Then the women said to Naomi, "Blessed is the LORD who has not left you without a redeemer today, and may his name become famous in Israel.
Ruth	Ruth	8	4	15	"May he also be to you a restorer of life and a sustainer of your old age; for your daughter-in-law, who loves you and is better to you than seven sons, has given birth to him."
Ruth	Ruth	8	4	16	Then Naomi took the child and laid him in her lap, and became his nurse.
Ruth	Ruth	8	4	17	The neighbor women gave him a name, saying, "A son has been born to Naomi!" So they named him Obed. He is the father of Jesse, the father of David.
Ruth	Ruth	8	4	18	Now these are the generations of Perez: to Perez was born Hezron,
Ruth	Ruth	8	4	19	and to Hezron was born Ram, and to Ram, Amminadab,
Ruth	Ruth	8	4	20	and to Amminadab was born Nahshon, and to Nahshon, Salmon,
Ruth	Ruth	8	4	21	and to Salmon was born Boaz, and to Boaz, Obed,
Ruth	Ruth	8	4	22	and to Obed was born Jesse, and to Jesse, David.

Ezra	Ezra	15	1	1	Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, in order to fulfill the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he sent a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and also put it in writing, saying:
Ezra	Ezra	15	1	2	"Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, 'The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and He has appointed me to build Him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.
Ezra	Ezra	15	1	3	'Whoever there is among you of all His people, may his God be with him! Let him go up to Jerusalem which is in Judah and rebuild the house of the LORD, the God of Israel; He is the God who is in Jerusalem.
Ezra	Ezra	15	1	4	'Every survivor, at whatever place he may live, let the men of that place support him with silver and gold, with goods and cattle, together with a freewill offering for the house of God which is in Jerusalem.'"
Ezra	Ezra	15	1	5	Then the heads of fathers' households of Judah and Benjamin and the priests and the Levites arose, even everyone whose spirit God had stirred to go up and rebuild the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem.
Ezra	Ezra	15	1	6	All those about them encouraged them with articles of silver, with gold, with goods, with cattle and with valuables, aside from all that was given as a freewill offering.
Ezra	Ezra	15	1	7	Also King Cyrus brought out the articles of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem and put in the house of his gods;
Ezra	Ezra	15	1	8	and Cyrus, king of Persia, had them brought out by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and he counted them out to Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.
Ezra	Ezra	15	1	9	Now this was their number: gold dishes, 1,000 silver dishes, 29 duplicates;
Ezra	Ezra	15	1	10	gold bowls, 410 silver bowls of a second kind and 1,000 other articles.
Ezra	Ezra	15	1	11	All the articles of gold and silver numbered 5,400. Sheshbazzar brought them all up with the exiles who went up from Babylon to Jerusalem.
Ezra	Ezra	15	2	1	Now these are the people of the province who came up out of the captivity of the exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away to Babylon, and returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his city.

Ezra	Ezra	15	2	41	The singers: the sons of Asaph, 128.
Ezra	Ezra	15	2	42	The sons of the gatekeepers: the sons of Shallum, the sons of Ater, the sons of Talmon, the sons of Akkub, the sons of Hatita, the sons of Shobai, in all 139.

Ezra	Ezra	15	2	47	the sons of Giddel, the sons of Gahar, the sons of Reaiah,
Ezra	Ezra	15	2	48	the sons of Rezin, the sons of Nekoda, the sons of Gazzam,
Ezra	Ezra	15	2	49	the sons of Uzza, the sons of Paseah, the sons of Besai,

Ezra	Ezra	15	2	57	the sons of Shephatiah, the sons of Hattil, the sons of Pochereth-hazzebaim, the sons of Ami.
Ezra	Ezra	15	2	58	All the temple servants and the sons of Solomon's servants were 392.
Ezra	Ezra	15	2	59	Now these are those who came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addan and Immer, but they were not able to give evidence of their fathers' households and their descendants, whether they were of Israel:
Ezra	Ezra	15	2	60	the sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, the sons of Nekoda, 652.
Ezra	Ezra	15	2	61	Of the sons of the priests: the sons of Habaiah, the sons of Hakkoz, the sons of Barzillai, who took a wife from the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and he was called by their name.
Ezra	Ezra	15	2	62	These searched among their ancestral registration, but they could not be located; therefore they were considered unclean and excluded from the priesthood.
Ezra	Ezra	15	2	63	The governor said to them that they should not eat from the most holy things until a priest stood up with Urim and Thummim.
Ezra	Ezra	15	2	64	The whole assembly numbered 42,360,
Ezra	Ezra	15	2	65	besides their male and female servants who numbered 7,337; and they had singing men and women.
Ezra	Ezra	15	2	66	Their horses were 736; their mules, 245;
Ezra	Ezra	15	2	67	their camels, 435; their donkeys, 6,720.
Ezra	Ezra	15	2	68	Some of the heads of fathers' households, when they arrived at the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem, offered willingly for the house of God to restore it on its foundation.
Ezra	Ezra	15	2	69	According to their ability they gave to the treasury for the work 61,gold drachmas and 5,000 silver minas and 100 priestly garments.
Ezra	Ezra	15	2	70	Now the priests and the Levites, some of the people, the singers, the gatekeepers and the temple servants lived in their cities, and all Israel in their cities.
Ezra	Ezra	15	3	1	Now when the seventh month came, and the sons of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered together as one man to Jerusalem.
Ezra	Ezra	15	3	2	Then Jeshua the son of Jozadak and his brothers the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and his brothers arose and built the altar of the God of Israel to offer burnt offerings on it, as it is written in the law of Moses, the man of God.
Ezra	Ezra	15	3	3	So they set up the altar on its foundation, for they were terrified because of the peoples of the lands; and they offered burnt offerings on it to the LORD, burnt offerings morning and evening.
Ezra	Ezra	15	3	4	They celebrated the Feast of Booths, as it is written, and offered the fixed number of burnt offerings daily, according to the ordinance, as each day required;
Ezra	Ezra	15	3	5	and afterward there was a continual burnt offering, also for the new moons and for all the fixed festivals of the LORD that were consecrated, and from everyone who offered a freewill offering to the LORD.
Ezra	Ezra	15	3	6	From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the LORD, but the foundation of the temple of the LORD had not been laid.
Ezra	Ezra	15	3	7	Then they gave money to the masons and carpenters, and food, drink and oil to the Sidonians and to the Tyrians, to bring cedar wood from Lebanon to the sea at Joppa, according to the permission they had from Cyrus king of Persia.
Ezra	Ezra	15	3	8	Now in the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem in the second month, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak and the rest of their brothers the priests and the Levites, and all who came from the captivity to Jerusalem, began the work and appointed the Levites from twenty years and older to oversee the work of the house of the LORD.
Ezra	Ezra	15	3	9	Then Jeshua with his sons and brothers stood united with Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah and the sons of Henadad with their sons and brothers the Levites, to oversee the workmen in the temple of God.
Ezra	Ezra	15	3	10	Now when the builders had laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, the priests stood in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise the LORD according to the directions of King David of Israel.
Ezra	Ezra	15	3	11	They sang, praising and giving thanks to the LORD, saying, "For He is good, for His lovingkindness is upon Israel forever." And all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised the LORD because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.
Ezra	Ezra	15	3	12	Yet many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers' households, the old men who had seen the first temple, wept with a loud voice when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, while many shouted aloud for joy,
Ezra	Ezra	15	3	13	so that the people could not distinguish the sound of the shout of joy from the sound of the weeping of the people, for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the sound was heard far away.
Ezra	Ezra	15	4	1	Now when the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the people of the exile were building a temple to the LORD God of Israel,
Ezra	Ezra	15	4	2	they approached Zerubbabel and the heads of fathers' households, and said to them, "Let us build with you, for we, like you, seek your God; and we have been sacrificing to Him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us up here."
Ezra	Ezra	15	4	3	But Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of the heads of fathers' households of Israel said to them, "You have nothing in common with us in building a house to our God; but we ourselves will together build to the LORD God of Israel, as King Cyrus, the king of Persia has commanded us."
Ezra	Ezra	15	4	4	Then the people of the land discouraged the people of Judah, and frightened them from building,
Ezra	Ezra	15	4	5	and hired counselors against them to frustrate their counsel all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.
Ezra	Ezra	15	4	6	Now in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.
Ezra	Ezra	15	4	7	And in the days of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel and the rest of his colleagues wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the text of the letter was written in Aramaic and translated from Aramaic.
Ezra	Ezra	15	4	8	Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes, as follows--
Ezra	Ezra	15	4	9	then wrote Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe and the rest of their colleagues, the judges and the lesser governors, the officials, the secretaries, the men of Erech, the Babylonians, the men of Susa, that is, the Elamites,
Ezra	Ezra	15	4	10	and the rest of the nations which the great and honorable Osnappar deported and settled in the city of Samaria, and in the rest of the region beyond the River. Now
Ezra	Ezra	15	4	11	this is the copy of the letter which they sent to him: "To King Artaxerxes: Your servants, the men in the region beyond the River, and now
Ezra	Ezra	15	4	12	let it be known to the king that the Jews who came up from you have come to us at Jerusalem; they are rebuilding the rebellious and evil city and are finishing the walls and repairing the foundations.
Ezra	Ezra	15	4	13	"Now let it be known to the king, that if that city is rebuilt and the walls are finished, they will not pay tribute, custom or toll, and it will damage the revenue of the kings.
Ezra	Ezra	15	4	14	"Now because we are in the service of the palace, and it is not fitting for us to see the king's dishonor, therefore we have sent and informed the king,
Ezra	Ezra	15	4	15	so that a search may be made in the record books of your fathers. And you will discover in the record books and learn that that city is a rebellious city and damaging to kings and provinces, and that they have incited revolt within it in past days; therefore that city was laid waste.
Ezra	Ezra	15	4	16	"We inform the king that if that city is rebuilt and the walls finished, as a result you will have no possession in the province beyond the River."
Ezra	Ezra	15	4	17	Then the king sent an answer to Rehum the commander, to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their colleagues who live in Samaria and in the rest of the provinces beyond the River: "Peace. And now
Ezra	Ezra	15	4	18	the document which you sent to us has been translated and read before me.
Ezra	Ezra	15	4	19	"A decree has been issued by me, and a search has been made and it has been discovered that that city has risen up against the kings in past days, that rebellion and revolt have been perpetrated in it,
Ezra	Ezra	15	4	20	that mighty kings have ruled over Jerusalem, governing all the provinces beyond the River, and that tribute, custom and toll were paid to them.
Ezra	Ezra	15	4	21	"So, now issue a decree to make these men stop work, that this city may not be rebuilt until a decree is issued by me.
Ezra	Ezra	15	4	22	"Beware of being negligent in carrying out this matter; why should damage increase to the detriment of the kings?"
Ezra	Ezra	15	4	23	Then as soon as the copy of King Artaxerxes' document was read before Rehum and Shimshai the scribe and their colleagues, they went in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews and stopped them by force of arms.
Ezra	Ezra	15	4	24	Then work on the house of God in Jerusalem ceased, and it was stopped until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.
Ezra	Ezra	15	5	1	When the prophets, Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, who was over them,
Ezra	Ezra	15	5	2	then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak arose and began to rebuild the house of God which is in Jerusalem; and the prophets of God were with them supporting them.
Ezra	Ezra	15	5	3	At that time Tattenai, the governor of the province beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai and their colleagues came to them and spoke to them thus, "Who issued you a decree to rebuild this temple and to finish this structure?"
Ezra	Ezra	15	5	4	Then we told them accordingly what the names of the men were who were reconstructing this building.
Ezra	Ezra	15	5	5	But the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews, and they did not stop them until a report could come to Darius, and then a written reply be returned concerning it.
Ezra	Ezra	15	5	6	This is the copy of the letter which Tattenai, the governor of the province beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai and his colleagues the officials, who were beyond the River, sent to Darius the king.
Ezra	Ezra	15	5	7	They sent a report to him in which it was written thus: "To Darius the king, all peace.
Ezra	Ezra	15	5	8	"Let it be known to the king that we have gone to the province of Judah, to the house of the great God, which is being built with huge stones, and beams are being laid in the walls; and this work is going on with great care and is succeeding in their hands.
Ezra	Ezra	15	5	9	"Then we asked those elders and said to them thus, 'Who issued you a decree to rebuild this temple and to finish this structure?'
Ezra	Ezra	15	5	10	"We also asked them their names so as to inform you, and that we might write down the names of the men who were at their head.
Ezra	Ezra	15	5	11	"Thus they answered us, saying, 'We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth and are rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and finished.
Ezra	Ezra	15	5	12	'But because our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath, He gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this temple and deported the people to Babylon.
Ezra	Ezra	15	5	13	'However, in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, King Cyrus issued a decree to rebuild this house of God.
Ezra	Ezra	15	5	14	'Also the gold and silver utensils of the house of God which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem, and brought them to the temple of Babylon, these King Cyrus took from the temple of Babylon and they were given to one whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had appointed governor.
Ezra	Ezra	15	5	15	'He said to him, "Take these utensils, go and deposit them in the temple in Jerusalem and let the house of God be rebuilt in its place."
Ezra	Ezra	15	5	16	'Then that Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the house of God in Jerusalem; and from then until now it has been under construction and it is not yet completed.'
Ezra	Ezra	15	5	17	"Now if it pleases the king, let a search be conducted in the king's treasure house, which is there in Babylon, if it be that a decree was issued by King Cyrus to rebuild this house of God at Jerusalem; and let the king send to us his decision concerning this matter."
Ezra	Ezra	15	6	1	Then King Darius issued a decree, and search was made in the archives, where the treasures were stored in Babylon.
Ezra	Ezra	15	6	2	In Ecbatana in the fortress, which is in the province of Media, a scroll was found and there was written in it as follows: "Memorandum--
Ezra	Ezra	15	6	3	"In the first year of King Cyrus, Cyrus the king issued a decree: 'Concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, let the temple, the place where sacrifices are offered, be rebuilt and let its foundations be retained, its height being cubits and its width 60 cubits;
Ezra	Ezra	15	6	4	with three layers of huge stones and one layer of timbers. And let the cost be paid from the royal treasury.
Ezra	Ezra	15	6	5	'Also let the gold and silver utensils of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, be returned and brought to their places in the temple in Jerusalem; and you shall put them in the house of God.'
Ezra	Ezra	15	6	6	"Now therefore, Tattenai, governor of the province beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai and your colleagues, the officials of the provinces beyond the River, keep away from there.
Ezra	Ezra	15	6	7	"Leave this work on the house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews rebuild this house of God on its site.
Ezra	Ezra	15	6	8	"Moreover, I issue a decree concerning what you are to do for these elders of Judah in the rebuilding of this house of God: the full cost is to be paid to these people from the royal treasury out of the taxes of the provinces beyond the River, and that without delay.
Ezra	Ezra	15	6	9	"Whatever is needed, both young bulls, rams, and lambs for a burnt offering to the God of heaven, and wheat, salt, wine and anointing oil, as the priests in Jerusalem request, it is to be given to them daily without fail,
Ezra	Ezra	15	6	10	that they may offer acceptable sacrifices to the God of heaven and pray for the life of the king and his sons.
Ezra	Ezra	15	6	11	"And I issued a decree that any man who violates this edict, a timber shall be drawn from his house and he shall be impaled on it and his house shall be made a refuse heap on account of this.
Ezra	Ezra	15	6	12	"May the God who has caused His name to dwell there overthrow any king or people who attempts to change it, so as to destroy this house of God in Jerusalem. I, Darius, have issued this decree, let it be carried out with all diligence!"
Ezra	Ezra	15	6	13	Then Tattenai, the governor of the province beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai and their colleagues carried out the decree with all diligence, just as King Darius had sent.
Ezra	Ezra	15	6	14	And the elders of the Jews were successful in building through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they finished building according to the command of the God of Israel and the decree of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.
Ezra	Ezra	15	6	15	This temple was completed on the third day of the month Adar; it was the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.
Ezra	Ezra	15	6	16	And the sons of Israel, the priests, the Levites and the rest of the exiles, celebrated the dedication of this house of God with joy.
Ezra	Ezra	15	6	17	They offered for the dedication of this temple of God bulls, 200 rams, 400 lambs, and as a sin offering for all Israel 12 male goats, corresponding to the number of the tribes of Israel.
Ezra	Ezra	15	6	18	Then they appointed the priests to their divisions and the Levites in their orders for the service of God in Jerusalem, as it is written in the book of Moses.
Ezra	Ezra	15	6	19	The exiles observed the Passover on the fourteenth of the first month.
Ezra	Ezra	15	6	20	For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were pure. Then they slaughtered the Passover lamb for all the exiles, both for their brothers the priests and for themselves.
Ezra	Ezra	15	6	21	The sons of Israel who returned from exile and all those who had separated themselves from the impurity of the nations of the land to join them, to seek the LORD God of Israel, ate the Passover.
Ezra	Ezra	15	6	22	And they observed the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with joy, for the LORD had caused them to rejoice, and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria toward them to encourage them in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.
Ezra	Ezra	15	7	1	Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, there went up Ezra son of Seraiah, son of Azariah, son of Hilkiah,
Ezra	Ezra	15	7	2	son of Shallum, son of Zadok, son of Ahitub,
Ezra	Ezra	15	7	3	son of Amariah, son of Azariah, son of Meraioth,
Ezra	Ezra	15	7	4	son of Zerahiah, son of Uzzi, son of Bukki,
Ezra	Ezra	15	7	5	son of Abishua, son of Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the chief priest.
Ezra	Ezra	15	7	6	This Ezra went up from Babylon, and he was a scribe skilled in the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given; and the king granted him all he requested because the hand of the LORD his God was upon him.
Ezra	Ezra	15	7	7	Some of the sons of Israel and some of the priests, the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers and the temple servants went up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes.
Ezra	Ezra	15	7	8	He came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king.
Ezra	Ezra	15	7	9	For on the first of the first month he began to go up from Babylon; and on the first of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, because the good hand of his God was upon him.
Ezra	Ezra	15	7	10	For Ezra had set his heart to study the law of the LORD and to practice it, and to teach His statutes and ordinances in Israel.
Ezra	Ezra	15	7	11	Now this is the copy of the decree which King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, learned in the words of the commandments of the LORD and His statutes to Israel:
Ezra	Ezra	15	7	12	"Artaxerxes, king of kings, to Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect peace. And now
Ezra	Ezra	15	7	13	I have issued a decree that any of the people of Israel and their priests and the Levites in my kingdom who are willing to go to Jerusalem, may go with you.
Ezra	Ezra	15	7	14	"Forasmuch as you are sent by the king and his seven counselors to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem according to the law of your God which is in your hand,
Ezra	Ezra	15	7	15	and to bring the silver and gold, which the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose dwelling is in Jerusalem,
Ezra	Ezra	15	7	16	with all the silver and gold which you find in the whole province of Babylon, along with the freewill offering of the people and of the priests, who offered willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem;
Ezra	Ezra	15	7	17	with this money, therefore, you shall diligently buy bulls, rams and lambs, with their grain offerings and their drink offerings and offer them on the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem.
Ezra	Ezra	15	7	18	"Whatever seems good to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and gold, you may do according to the will of your God.
Ezra	Ezra	15	7	19	"Also the utensils which are given to you for the service of the house of your God, deliver in full before the God of Jerusalem.
Ezra	Ezra	15	7	20	"The rest of the needs for the house of your God, for which you may have occasion to provide, provide for it from the royal treasury.
Ezra	Ezra	15	7	21	"I, even I, King Artaxerxes, issue a decree to all the treasurers who are in the provinces beyond the River, that whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, may require of you, it shall be done diligently,
Ezra	Ezra	15	7	22	even up to talents of silver, 100 kors of wheat, 100 baths of wine, 100 baths of oil, and salt as needed.
Ezra	Ezra	15	7	23	"Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be done with zeal for the house of the God of heaven, so that there will not be wrath against the kingdom of the king and his sons.
Ezra	Ezra	15	7	24	"We also inform you that it is not allowed to impose tax, tribute or toll on any of the priests, Levites, singers, doorkeepers, Nethinim or servants of this house of God.
Ezra	Ezra	15	7	25	"You, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God which is in your hand, appoint magistrates and judges that they may judge all the people who are in the province beyond the River, even all those who know the laws of your God; and you may teach anyone who is ignorant of them.
Ezra	Ezra	15	7	26	"Whoever will not observe the law of your God and the law of the king, let judgment be executed upon him strictly, whether for death or for banishment or for confiscation of goods or for imprisonment."
Ezra	Ezra	15	7	27	Blessed be the LORD, the God of our fathers, who has put such a thing as this in the king's heart, to adorn the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem,
Ezra	Ezra	15	7	28	and has extended lovingkindness to me before the king and his counselors and before all the king's mighty princes. Thus I was strengthened according to the hand of the LORD my God upon me, and I gathered leading men from Israel to go up with me.
Ezra	Ezra	15	8	1	Now these are the heads of their fathers' households and the genealogical enrollment of those who went up with me from Babylon in the reign of King Artaxerxes:
Ezra	Ezra	15	8	2	of the sons of Phinehas, Gershom; of the sons of Ithamar, Daniel; of the sons of David, Hattush;
Ezra	Ezra	15	8	3	of the sons of Shecaniah who was of the sons of Parosh, Zechariah and with him males who were in the genealogical list;
Ezra	Ezra	15	8	4	of the sons of Pahath-moab, Eliehoenai the son of Zerahiah and males with him;
Ezra	Ezra	15	8	5	of the sons of Zattu, Shecaniah, the son of Jahaziel and males with him;
Ezra	Ezra	15	8	6	and of the sons of Adin, Ebed the son of Jonathan and males with him;
Ezra	Ezra	15	8	7	and of the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah and males with him;
Ezra	Ezra	15	8	8	and of the sons of Shephatiah, Zebadiah the son of Michael and males with him;
Ezra	Ezra	15	8	9	of the sons of Joab, Obadiah the son of Jehiel and males with him;
Ezra	Ezra	15	8	10	and of the sons of Bani, Shelomith, the son of Josiphiah and males with him;
Ezra	Ezra	15	8	11	and of the sons of Bebai, Zechariah the son of Bebai and males with him;
Ezra	Ezra	15	8	12	and of the sons of Azgad, Johanan the son of Hakkatan and males with him;
Ezra	Ezra	15	8	13	and of the sons of Adonikam, the last ones, these being their names, Eliphelet, Jeuel and Shemaiah, and males with them;
Ezra	Ezra	15	8	14	and of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and Zabbud, and males with them.
Ezra	Ezra	15	8	15	Now I assembled them at the river that runs to Ahava, where we camped for three days; and when I observed the people and the priests, I did not find any Levites there.
Ezra	Ezra	15	8	16	So I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah and Meshullam, leading men, and for Joiarib and Elnathan, teachers.
Ezra	Ezra	15	8	17	I sent them to Iddo the leading man at the place Casiphia; and I told them what to say to Iddo and his brothers, the temple servants at the place Casiphia, that is, to bring ministers to us for the house of our God.
Ezra	Ezra	15	8	18	According to the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of insight of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel, namely Sherebiah, and his sons and brothers, men;
Ezra	Ezra	15	8	19	and Hashabiah and Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, with his brothers and their sons, men;
Ezra	Ezra	15	8	20	and of the temple servants, whom David and the princes had given for the service of the Levites, all of them designated by name.
Ezra	Ezra	15	8	21	Then I proclaimed a fast there at the river of Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God to seek from Him a safe journey for us, our little ones, and all our possessions.
Ezra	Ezra	15	8	22	For I was ashamed to request from the king troops and horsemen to protect us from the enemy on the way, because we had said to the king, "The hand of our God is favorably disposed to all those who seek Him, but His power and His anger are against all those who forsake Him."
Ezra	Ezra	15	8	23	So we fasted and sought our God concerning this matter, and He listened to our entreaty.
Ezra	Ezra	15	8	24	Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and with them ten of their brothers;
Ezra	Ezra	15	8	25	and I weighed out to them the silver, the gold and the utensils, the offering for the house of our God which the king and his counselors and his princes and all Israel present there had offered.
Ezra	Ezra	15	8	26	Thus I weighed into their hands talents of silver, and silver utensils worth 100 talents, and 100 gold talents,
Ezra	Ezra	15	8	27	and gold bowls worth 1,000 darics, and two utensils of fine shiny bronze, precious as gold.
Ezra	Ezra	15	8	28	Then I said to them, "You are holy to the LORD, and the utensils are holy; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to the LORD God of your fathers.
Ezra	Ezra	15	8	29	"Watch and keep them until you weigh them before the leading priests, the Levites and the heads of the fathers' households of Israel at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD."
Ezra	Ezra	15	8	30	So the priests and the Levites accepted the weighed out silver and gold and the utensils, to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God.
Ezra	Ezra	15	8	31	Then we journeyed from the river Ahava on the twelfth of the first month to go to Jerusalem; and the hand of our God was over us, and He delivered us from the hand of the enemy and the ambushes by the way.
Ezra	Ezra	15	8	32	Thus we came to Jerusalem and remained there three days.
Ezra	Ezra	15	8	33	On the fourth day the silver and the gold and the utensils were weighed out in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest, and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them were the Levites, Jozabad the son of Jeshua and Noadiah the son of Binnui.
Ezra	Ezra	15	8	34	Everything was numbered and weighed, and all the weight was recorded at that time.
Ezra	Ezra	15	8	35	The exiles who had come from the captivity offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel: bulls for all Israel, 96 rams, 77 lambs, 12 male goats for a sin offering, all as a burnt offering to the LORD.
Ezra	Ezra	15	8	36	Then they delivered the king's edicts to the king's satraps and to the governors in the provinces beyond the River, and they supported the people and the house of God.
Ezra	Ezra	15	9	1	Now when these things had been completed, the princes approached me, saying, "The people of Israel and the priests and the Levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, according to their abominations, those of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians and the Amorites.
Ezra	Ezra	15	9	2	"For they have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and for their sons, so that the holy race has intermingled with the peoples of the lands; indeed, the hands of the princes and the rulers have been foremost in this unfaithfulness."
Ezra	Ezra	15	9	3	When I heard about this matter, I tore my garment and my robe, and pulled some of the hair from my head and my beard, and sat down appalled.
Ezra	Ezra	15	9	4	Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel on account of the unfaithfulness of the exiles gathered to me, and I sat appalled until the evening offering.
Ezra	Ezra	15	9	5	But at the evening offering I arose from my humiliation, even with my garment and my robe torn, and I fell on my knees and stretched out my hands to the LORD my God;
Ezra	Ezra	15	9	6	and I said, "O my God, I am ashamed and embarrassed to lift up my face to You, my God, for our iniquities have risen above our heads and our guilt has grown even to the heavens.
Ezra	Ezra	15	9	7	"Since the days of our fathers to this day we have been in great guilt, and on account of our iniquities we, our kings and our priests have been given into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity and to plunder and to open shame, as it is this day.
Ezra	Ezra	15	9	8	"But now for a brief moment grace has been shown from the LORD our God, to leave us an escaped remnant and to give us a peg in His holy place, that our God may enlighten our eyes and grant us a little reviving in our bondage.
Ezra	Ezra	15	9	9	"For we are slaves; yet in our bondage our God has not forsaken us, but has extended lovingkindness to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us reviving to raise up the house of our God, to restore its ruins and to give us a wall in Judah and Jerusalem.
Ezra	Ezra	15	9	10	"Now, our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken Your commandments,
Ezra	Ezra	15	9	11	which You have commanded by Your servants the prophets, saying, 'The land which you are entering to possess is an unclean land with the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, with their abominations which have filled it from end to end and with their impurity.
Ezra	Ezra	15	9	12	'So now do not give your daughters to their sons nor take their daughters to your sons, and never seek their peace or their prosperity, that you may be strong and eat the good things of the land and leave it as an inheritance to your sons forever.'
Ezra	Ezra	15	9	13	"After all that has come upon us for our evil deeds and our great guilt, since You our God have requited us less than our iniquities deserve, and have given us an escaped remnant as this,
Ezra	Ezra	15	9	14	shall we again break Your commandments and intermarry with the peoples who commit these abominations? Would You not be angry with us to the point of destruction, until there is no remnant nor any who escape?
Ezra	Ezra	15	9	15	"O LORD God of Israel, You are righteous, for we have been left an escaped remnant, as it is this day; behold, we are before You in our guilt, for no one can stand before You because of this."
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	1	Now while Ezra was praying and making confession, weeping and prostrating himself before the house of God, a very large assembly, men, women and children, gathered to him from Israel; for the people wept bitterly.
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	2	Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, said to Ezra, "We have been unfaithful to our God and have married foreign women from the peoples of the land; yet now there is hope for Israel in spite of this.
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	3	"So now let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives and their children, according to the counsel of my lord and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	4	"Arise! For this matter is your responsibility, but we will be with you; be courageous and act."
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	5	Then Ezra rose and made the leading priests, the Levites and all Israel, take oath that they would do according to this proposal; so they took the oath.
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	6	Then Ezra rose from before the house of God and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib. Although he went there, he did not eat bread nor drink water, for he was mourning over the unfaithfulness of the exiles.
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	7	They made a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the exiles, that they should assemble at Jerusalem,
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	8	and that whoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the leaders and the elders, all his possessions should be forfeited and he himself excluded from the assembly of the exiles.
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	9	So all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled at Jerusalem within the three days. It was the ninth month on the twentieth of the month, and all the people sat in the open square before the house of God, trembling because of this matter and the heavy rain.
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	10	Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, "You have been unfaithful and have married foreign wives adding to the guilt of Israel.
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	11	"Now therefore, make confession to the LORD God of your fathers and do His will; and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from the foreign wives."
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	12	Then all the assembly replied with a loud voice, "That's right! As you have said, so it is our duty to do.
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	13	"But there are many people; it is the rainy season and we are not able to stand in the open. Nor can the task be done in one or two days, for we have transgressed greatly in this matter.
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	14	"Let our leaders represent the whole assembly and let all those in our cities who have married foreign wives come at appointed times, together with the elders and judges of each city, until the fierce anger of our God on account of this matter is turned away from us."
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	15	Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah opposed this, with Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite supporting them.
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	16	But the exiles did so. And Ezra the priest selected men who were heads of fathers' households for each of their father's households, all of them by name. So they convened on the first day of the tenth month to investigate the matter.
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	17	They finished investigating all the men who had married foreign wives by the first day of the first month.
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	18	Among the sons of the priests who had married foreign wives were found of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib and Gedaliah.
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	19	They pledged to put away their wives, and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their offense.
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	20	Of the sons of Immer there were Hanani and Zebadiah;
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	21	and of the sons of Harim: Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel and Uzziah;
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	22	and of the sons of Pashhur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad and Elasah.
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	23	Of Levites there were Jozabad, Shimei, Kelaiah (that is, Kelita), Pethahiah, Judah and Eliezer.
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	24	Of the singers there was Eliashib; and of the gatekeepers: Shallum, Telem and Uri.
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	25	Of Israel, of the sons of Parosh there were Ramiah, Izziah, Malchijah, Mijamin, Eleazar, Malchijah and Benaiah;
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	26	and of the sons of Elam: Mattaniah, Zechariah, Jehiel, Abdi, Jeremoth and Elijah;
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	27	and of the sons of Zattu: Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Jeremoth, Zabad and Aziza;
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	28	and of the sons of Bebai: Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai and Athlai;
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	29	and of the sons of Bani: Meshullam, Malluch and Adaiah, Jashub, Sheal and Jeremoth;
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	30	and of the sons of Pahath-moab: Adna, Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, Binnui and Manasseh;
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	31	and of the sons of Harim: Eliezer, Isshijah, Malchijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon,
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	32	Benjamin, Malluch and Shemariah;
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	33	of the sons of Hashum: Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh and Shimei;
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	34	of the sons of Bani: Maadai, Amram, Uel,
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	35	Benaiah, Bedeiah, Cheluhi,
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	36	Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	37	Mattaniah, Mattenai, Jaasu,
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	38	Bani, Binnui, Shimei,
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	39	Shelemiah, Nathan, Adaiah,
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	40	Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai,
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	41	Azarel, Shelemiah, Shemariah,
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	42	Shallum, Amariah and Joseph.
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	43	Of the sons of Nebo there were Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jaddai, Joel and Benaiah.
Ezra	Ezra	15	10	44	All these had married foreign wives, and some of them had wives by whom they had children.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	1	1	The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah. Now it happened in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, while I was in Susa the capitol,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	1	2	that Hanani, one of my brothers, and some men from Judah came; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped and had survived the captivity, and about Jerusalem.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	1	3	They said to me, "The remnant there in the province who survived the captivity are in great distress and reproach, and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down and its gates are burned with fire."
Nehemiah	Neh	16	1	4	When I heard these words, I sat down and wept and mourned for days; and I was fasting and praying before the God of heaven.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	1	5	I said, "I beseech You, O LORD God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who preserves the covenant and lovingkindness for those who love Him and keep His commandments,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	1	6	let Your ear now be attentive and Your eyes open to hear the prayer of Your servant which I am praying before You now, day and night, on behalf of the sons of Israel Your servants, confessing the sins of the sons of Israel which we have sinned against You; I and my father's house have sinned.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	1	7	"We have acted very corruptly against You and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances which You commanded Your servant Moses.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	1	8	"Remember the word which You commanded Your servant Moses, saying, 'If you are unfaithful I will scatter you among the peoples;
Nehemiah	Neh	16	1	9	but if you return to Me and keep My commandments and do them, though those of you who have been scattered were in the most remote part of the heavens, I will gather them from there and will bring them to the place where I have chosen to cause My name to dwell.'
Nehemiah	Neh	16	1	10	"They are Your servants and Your people whom You redeemed by Your great power and by Your strong hand.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	1	11	"O Lord, I beseech You, may Your ear be attentive to the prayer of Your servant and the prayer of Your servants who delight to revere Your name, and make Your servant successful today and grant him compassion before this man." Now I was the cupbearer to the king.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	2	1	And it came about in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, that wine was before him, and I took up the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had not been sad in his presence.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	2	2	So the king said to me, "Why is your face sad though you are not sick? This is nothing but sadness of heart." Then I was very much afraid.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	2	3	I said to the king, "Let the king live forever. Why should my face not be sad when the city, the place of my fathers' tombs, lies desolate and its gates have been consumed by fire?"
Nehemiah	Neh	16	2	4	Then the king said to me, "What would you request?" So I prayed to the God of heaven.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	2	5	I said to the king, "If it please the king, and if your servant has found favor before you, send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers' tombs, that I may rebuild it."
Nehemiah	Neh	16	2	6	Then the king said to me, the queen sitting beside him, "How long will your journey be, and when will you return?" So it pleased the king to send me, and I gave him a definite time.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	2	7	And I said to the king, "If it please the king, let letters be given me for the governors of the provinces beyond the River, that they may allow me to pass through until I come to Judah,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	2	8	and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the fortress which is by the temple, for the wall of the city and for the house to which I will go." And the king granted them to me because the good hand of my God was on me.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	2	9	Then I came to the governors of the provinces beyond the River and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent with me officers of the army and horsemen.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	2	10	When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about it, it was very displeasing to them that someone had come to seek the welfare of the sons of Israel.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	2	11	So I came to Jerusalem and was there three days.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	2	12	And I arose in the night, I and a few men with me. I did not tell anyone what my God was putting into my mind to do for Jerusalem and there was no animal with me except the animal on which I was riding.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	2	13	So I went out at night by the Valley Gate in the direction of the Dragon's Well and on to the Refuse Gate, inspecting the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down and its gates which were consumed by fire.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	2	14	Then I passed on to the Fountain Gate and the King's Pool, but there was no place for my mount to pass.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	2	15	So I went up at night by the ravine and inspected the wall. Then I entered the Valley Gate again and returned.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	2	16	The officials did not know where I had gone or what I had done; nor had I as yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials or the rest who did the work.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	2	17	Then I said to them, "You see the bad situation we are in, that Jerusalem is desolate and its gates burned by fire. Come, let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem so that we will no longer be a reproach."
Nehemiah	Neh	16	2	18	I told them how the hand of my God had been favorable to me and also about the king's words which he had spoken to me. Then they said, "Let us arise and build." So they put their hands to the good work.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	2	19	But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard it, they mocked us and despised us and said, "What is this thing you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?"
Nehemiah	Neh	16	2	20	So I answered them and said to them, "The God of heaven will give us success; therefore we His servants will arise and build, but you have no portion, right or memorial in Jerusalem."
Nehemiah	Neh	16	3	1	Then Eliashib the high priest arose with his brothers the priests and built the Sheep Gate; they consecrated it and hung its doors. They consecrated the wall to the Tower of the Hundred and the Tower of Hananel.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	3	2	Next to him the men of Jericho built, and next to them Zaccur the son of Imri built.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	3	3	Now the sons of Hassenaah built the Fish Gate; they laid its beams and hung its doors with its bolts and bars.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	3	4	Next to them Meremoth the son of Uriah the son of Hakkoz made repairs. And next to him Meshullam the son of Berechiah the son of Meshezabel made repairs. And next to him Zadok the son of Baana also made repairs.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	3	5	Moreover, next to him the Tekoites made repairs, but their nobles did not support the work of their masters.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	3	6	Joiada the son of Paseah and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah repaired the Old Gate; they laid its beams and hung its doors with its bolts and its bars.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	3	7	Next to them Melatiah the Gibeonite and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon and of Mizpah, also made repairs for the official seat of the governor of the province beyond the River.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	3	8	Next to him Uzziel the son of Harhaiah of the goldsmiths made repairs. And next to him Hananiah, one of the perfumers, made repairs, and they restored Jerusalem as far as the Broad Wall.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	3	9	Next to them Rephaiah the son of Hur, the official of half the district of Jerusalem, made repairs.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	3	10	Next to them Jedaiah the son of Harumaph made repairs opposite his house. And next to him Hattush the son of Hashabneiah made repairs.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	3	11	Malchijah the son of Harim and Hasshub the son of Pahath-moab repaired another section and the Tower of Furnaces.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	3	12	Next to him Shallum the son of Hallohesh, the official of half the district of Jerusalem, made repairs, he and his daughters.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	3	13	Hanun and the inhabitants of Zanoah repaired the Valley Gate. They built it and hung its doors with its bolts and its bars, and a thousand cubits of the wall to the Refuse Gate.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	3	14	Malchijah the son of Rechab, the official of the district of Beth-haccherem repaired the Refuse Gate. He built it and hung its doors with its bolts and its bars.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	3	15	Shallum the son of Col-hozeh, the official of the district of Mizpah, repaired the Fountain Gate. He built it, covered it and hung its doors with its bolts and its bars, and the wall of the Pool of Shelah at the king's garden as far as the steps that descend from the city of David.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	3	16	After him Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, official of half the district of Beth-zur, made repairs as far as a point opposite the tombs of David, and as far as the artificial pool and the house of the mighty men.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	3	17	After him the Levites carried out repairs under Rehum the son of Bani. Next to him Hashabiah, the official of half the district of Keilah, carried out repairs for his district.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	3	18	After him their brothers carried out repairs under Bavvai the son of Henadad, official of the other half of the district of Keilah.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	3	19	Next to him Ezer the son of Jeshua, the official of Mizpah, repaired another section in front of the ascent of the armory at the Angle.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	3	20	After him Baruch the son of Zabbai zealously repaired another section, from the Angle to the doorway of the house of Eliashib the high priest.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	3	21	After him Meremoth the son of Uriah the son of Hakkoz repaired another section, from the doorway of Eliashib's house even as far as the end of his house.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	3	22	After him the priests, the men of the valley, carried out repairs.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	3	23	After them Benjamin and Hasshub carried out repairs in front of their house. After them Azariah the son of Maaseiah, son of Ananiah, carried out repairs beside his house.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	3	24	After him Binnui the son of Henadad repaired another section, from the house of Azariah as far as the Angle and as far as the corner.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	3	25	Palal the son of Uzai made repairs in front of the Angle and the tower projecting from the upper house of the king, which is by the court of the guard. After him Pedaiah the son of Parosh made repairs.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	3	26	The temple servants living in Ophel made repairs as far as the front of the Water Gate toward the east and the projecting tower.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	3	27	After them the Tekoites repaired another section in front of the great projecting tower and as far as the wall of Ophel.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	3	28	Above the Horse Gate the priests carried out repairs, each in front of his house.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	3	29	After them Zadok the son of Immer carried out repairs in front of his house. And after him Shemaiah the son of Shecaniah, the keeper of the East Gate, carried out repairs.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	3	30	After him Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph, repaired another section. After him Meshullam the son of Berechiah carried out repairs in front of his own quarters.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	3	31	After him Malchijah, one of the goldsmiths, carried out repairs as far as the house of the temple servants and of the merchants, in front of the Inspection Gate and as far as the upper room of the corner.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	3	32	Between the upper room of the corner and the Sheep Gate the goldsmiths and the merchants carried out repairs.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	4	1	Now it came about that when Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he became furious and very angry and mocked the Jews.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	4	2	He spoke in the presence of his brothers and the wealthy men of Samaria and said, "What are these feeble Jews doing? Are they going to restore it for themselves? Can they offer sacrifices? Can they finish in a day? Can they revive the stones from the dusty rubble even the burned ones?"
Nehemiah	Neh	16	4	3	Now Tobiah the Ammonite was near him and he said, "Even what they are building--if a fox should jump on it, he would break their stone wall down!"
Nehemiah	Neh	16	4	4	Hear, O our God, how we are despised! Return their reproach on their own heads and give them up for plunder in a land of captivity.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	4	5	Do not forgive their iniquity and let not their sin be blotted out before You, for they have demoralized the builders.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	4	6	So we built the wall and the whole wall was joined together to half its height, for the people had a mind to work.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	4	7	Now when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites and the Ashdodites heard that the repair of the walls of Jerusalem went on, and that the breaches began to be closed, they were very angry.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	4	8	All of them conspired together to come and fight against Jerusalem and to cause a disturbance in it.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	4	9	But we prayed to our God, and because of them we set up a guard against them day and night.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	4	10	Thus in Judah it was said, "The strength of the burden bearers is failing, Yet there is much rubbish; And we ourselves are unable To rebuild the wall."
Nehemiah	Neh	16	4	11	Our enemies said, "They will not know or see until we come among them, kill them and put a stop to the work."
Nehemiah	Neh	16	4	12	When the Jews who lived near them came and told us ten times, "They will come up against us from every place where you may turn,"
Nehemiah	Neh	16	4	13	then I stationed men in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, the exposed places, and I stationed the people in families with their swords, spears and bows.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	4	14	When I saw their fear, I rose and spoke to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people: "Do not be afraid of them; remember the Lord who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives and your houses."
Nehemiah	Neh	16	4	15	When our enemies heard that it was known to us, and that God had frustrated their plan, then all of us returned to the wall, each one to his work.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	4	16	From that day on, half of my servants carried on the work while half of them held the spears, the shields, the bows and the breastplates; and the captains were behind the whole house of Judah.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	4	17	Those who were rebuilding the wall and those who carried burdens took their load with one hand doing the work and the other holding a weapon.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	4	18	As for the builders, each wore his sword girded at his side as he built, while the trumpeter stood near me.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	4	19	I said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, "The work is great and extensive, and we are separated on the wall far from one another.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	4	20	"At whatever place you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us."
Nehemiah	Neh	16	4	21	So we carried on the work with half of them holding spears from dawn until the stars appeared.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	4	22	At that time I also said to the people, "Let each man with his servant spend the night within Jerusalem so that they may be a guard for us by night and a laborer by day."
Nehemiah	Neh	16	4	23	So neither I, my brothers, my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us removed our clothes, each took his weapon even to the water.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	5	1	Now there was a great outcry of the people and of their wives against their Jewish brothers.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	5	2	For there were those who said, "We, our sons and our daughters are many; therefore let us get grain that we may eat and live."
Nehemiah	Neh	16	5	3	There were others who said, "We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards and our houses that we might get grain because of the famine."
Nehemiah	Neh	16	5	4	Also there were those who said, "We have borrowed money for the king's tax on our fields and our vineyards.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	5	5	"Now our flesh is like the flesh of our brothers, our children like their children. Yet behold, we are forcing our sons and our daughters to be slaves, and some of our daughters are forced into bondage already, and we are helpless because our fields and vineyards belong to others."
Nehemiah	Neh	16	5	6	Then I was very angry when I had heard their outcry and these words.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	5	7	I consulted with myself and contended with the nobles and the rulers and said to them, "You are exacting usury, each from his brother!" Therefore, I held a great assembly against them.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	5	8	I said to them, "We according to our ability have redeemed our Jewish brothers who were sold to the nations; now would you even sell your brothers that they may be sold to us?" Then they were silent and could not find a word to say.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	5	9	Again I said, "The thing which you are doing is not good; should you not walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the nations, our enemies?
Nehemiah	Neh	16	5	10	"And likewise I, my brothers and my servants are lending them money and grain. Please, let us leave off this usury.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	5	11	"Please, give back to them this very day their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money and of the grain, the new wine and the oil that you are exacting from them."
Nehemiah	Neh	16	5	12	Then they said, "We will give it back and will require nothing from them; we will do exactly as you say." So I called the priests and took an oath from them that they would do according to this promise.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	5	13	I also shook out the front of my garment and said, "Thus may God shake out every man from his house and from his possessions who does not fulfill this promise; even thus may he be shaken out and emptied." And all the assembly said, "Amen!" And they praised the LORD. Then the people did according to this promise.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	5	14	Moreover, from the day that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year to the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes, for twelve years, neither I nor my kinsmen have eaten the governor's food allowance.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	5	15	But the former governors who were before me laid burdens on the people and took from them bread and wine besides forty shekels of silver; even their servants domineered the people. But I did not do so because of the fear of God.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	5	16	I also applied myself to the work on this wall; we did not buy any land, and all my servants were gathered there for the work.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	5	17	Moreover, there were at my table one hundred and fifty Jews and officials, besides those who came to us from the nations that were around us.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	5	18	Now that which was prepared for each day was one ox and six choice sheep, also birds were prepared for me; and once in ten days all sorts of wine were furnished in abundance. Yet for all this I did not demand the governor's food allowance, because the servitude was heavy on this people.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	5	19	Remember me, O my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	6	1	Now when it was reported to Sanballat, Tobiah, to Geshem the Arab and to the rest of our enemies that I had rebuilt the wall, and that no breach remained in it, although at that time I had not set up the doors in the gates,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	6	2	then Sanballat and Geshem sent a message to me, saying, "Come, let us meet together at Chephirim in the plain of Ono." But they were planning to harm me.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	6	3	So I sent messengers to them, saying, "I am doing a great work and I cannot come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you?"
Nehemiah	Neh	16	6	4	They sent messages to me four times in this manner, and I answered them in the same way.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	6	5	Then Sanballat sent his servant to me in the same manner a fifth time with an open letter in his hand.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	6	6	In it was written, "It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu says, that you and the Jews are planning to rebel; therefore you are rebuilding the wall. And you are to be their king, according to these reports.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	6	7	"You have also appointed prophets to proclaim in Jerusalem concerning you, 'A king is in Judah!' And now it will be reported to the king according to these reports. So come now, let us take counsel together."
Nehemiah	Neh	16	6	8	Then I sent a message to him saying, "Such things as you are saying have not been done, but you are inventing them in your own mind."
Nehemiah	Neh	16	6	9	For all of them were trying to frighten us, thinking, "They will become discouraged with the work and it will not be done." But now, O God, strengthen my hands.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	6	10	When I entered the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel, who was confined at home, he said, "Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you, and they are coming to kill you at night."
Nehemiah	Neh	16	6	11	But I said, "Should a man like me flee? And could one such as I go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in."
Nehemiah	Neh	16	6	12	Then I perceived that surely God had not sent him, but he uttered his prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	6	13	He was hired for this reason, that I might become frightened and act accordingly and sin, so that they might have an evil report in order that they could reproach me.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	6	14	Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these works of theirs, and also Noadiah the prophetess and the rest of the prophets who were trying to frighten me.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	6	15	So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth of the month Elul, in fifty-two days.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	6	16	When all our enemies heard of it, and all the nations surrounding us saw it, they lost their confidence; for they recognized that this work had been accomplished with the help of our God.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	6	17	Also in those days many letters went from the nobles of Judah to Tobiah, and Tobiah's letters came to them.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	6	18	For many in Judah were bound by oath to him because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	6	19	Moreover, they were speaking about his good deeds in my presence and reported my words to him. Then Tobiah sent letters to frighten me.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	7	1	Now when the wall was rebuilt and I had set up the doors, and the gatekeepers and the singers and the Levites were appointed,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	7	2	then I put Hanani my brother, and Hananiah the commander of the fortress, in charge of Jerusalem, for he was a faithful man and feared God more than many.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	7	3	Then I said to them, "Do not let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot, and while they are standing guard, let them shut and bolt the doors. Also appoint guards from the inhabitants of Jerusalem, each at his post, and each in front of his own house."
Nehemiah	Neh	16	7	4	Now the city was large and spacious, but the people in it were few and the houses were not built.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	7	5	Then my God put it into my heart to assemble the nobles, the officials and the people to be enrolled by genealogies. Then I found the book of the genealogy of those who came up first in which I found the following record:
Nehemiah	Neh	16	7	6	These are the people of the province who came up from the captivity of the exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his city,

Nehemiah	Neh	16	7	60	All the temple servants and the sons of Solomon's servants were 392.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	7	61	These were they who came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon and Immer; but they could not show their fathers' houses or their descendants, whether they were of Israel:
Nehemiah	Neh	16	7	62	the sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, the sons of Nekoda, 642.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	7	63	Of the priests: the sons of Hobaiah, the sons of Hakkoz, the sons of Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai, the Gileadite, and was named after them.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	7	64	These searched among their ancestral registration, but it could not be located; therefore they were considered unclean and excluded from the priesthood.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	7	65	The governor said to them that they should not eat from the most holy things until a priest arose with Urim and Thummim.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	7	66	The whole assembly together was 42,360,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	7	67	besides their male and their female servants, of whom there were 7,337; and they had male and female singers.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	7	68	Their horses were 736; their mules, 245;
Nehemiah	Neh	16	7	69	their camels, 435; their donkeys, 6,720.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	7	70	Some from among the heads of fathers' households gave to the work. The governor gave to the treasury 1,gold drachmas, 50 basins, 530 priests' garments.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	7	71	Some of the heads of fathers' households gave into the treasury of the work 20,gold drachmas and 2,200 silver minas.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	7	72	That which the rest of the people gave was 20,gold drachmas and 2,000 silver minas and 67 priests' garments.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	7	73	Now the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, some of the people, the temple servants and all Israel, lived in their cities. And when the seventh month came, the sons of Israel were in their cities.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	8	1	And all the people gathered as one man at the square which was in front of the Water Gate, and they asked Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses which the LORD had given to Israel.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	8	2	Then Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly of men, women and all who could listen with understanding, on the first day of the seventh month.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	8	3	He read from it before the square which was in front of the Water Gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of men and women, those who could understand; and all the people were attentive to the book of the law.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	8	4	Ezra the scribe stood at a wooden podium which they had made for the purpose. And beside him stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah on his right hand; and Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah and Meshullam on his left hand.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	8	5	Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people for he was standing above all the people; and when he opened it, all the people stood up.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	8	6	Then Ezra blessed the LORD the great God. And all the people answered, "Amen, Amen!" while lifting up their hands; then they bowed low and worshiped the LORD with their faces to the ground.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	8	7	Also Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, the Levites, explained the law to the people while the people remained in their place.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	8	8	They read from the book, from the law of God, translating to give the sense so that they understood the reading.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	8	9	Then Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who taught the people said to all the people, "This day is holy to the LORD your God; do not mourn or weep." For all the people were weeping when they heard the words of the law.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	8	10	Then he said to them, "Go, eat of the fat, drink of the sweet, and send portions to him who has nothing prepared; for this day is holy to our Lord. Do not be grieved, for the joy of the LORD is your strength."
Nehemiah	Neh	16	8	11	So the Levites calmed all the people, saying, "Be still, for the day is holy; do not be grieved."
Nehemiah	Neh	16	8	12	All the people went away to eat, to drink, to send portions and to celebrate a great festival, because they understood the words which had been made known to them.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	8	13	Then on the second day the heads of fathers' households of all the people, the priests and the Levites were gathered to Ezra the scribe that they might gain insight into the words of the law.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	8	14	They found written in the law how the LORD had commanded through Moses that the sons of Israel should live in booths during the feast of the seventh month.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	8	15	So they proclaimed and circulated a proclamation in all their cities and in Jerusalem, saying, "Go out to the hills, and bring olive branches and wild olive branches, myrtle branches, palm branches and branches of other leafy trees, to make booths, as it is written."
Nehemiah	Neh	16	8	16	So the people went out and brought them and made booths for themselves, each on his roof, and in their courts and in the courts of the house of God, and in the square at the Water Gate and in the square at the Gate of Ephraim.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	8	17	The entire assembly of those who had returned from the captivity made booths and lived in them. The sons of Israel had indeed not done so from the days of Joshua the son of Nun to that day. And there was great rejoicing.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	8	18	He read from the book of the law of God daily, from the first day to the last day. And they celebrated the feast seven days, and on the eighth day there was a solemn assembly according to the ordinance.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	1	Now on the twenty-fourth day of this month the sons of Israel assembled with fasting, in sackcloth and with dirt upon them.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	2	The descendants of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners, and stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	3	While they stood in their place, they read from the book of the law of the LORD their God for a fourth of the day; and for another fourth they confessed and worshiped the LORD their God.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	4	Now on the Levites' platform stood Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani and Chenani, and they cried with a loud voice to the LORD their God.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	5	Then the Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah and Pethahiah, said, "Arise, bless the LORD your God forever and ever! O may Your glorious name be blessed And exalted above all blessing and praise!
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	6	"You alone are the LORD. You have made the heavens, The heaven of heavens with all their host, The earth and all that is on it, The seas and all that is in them. You give life to all of them And the heavenly host bows down before You.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	7	"You are the LORD God, Who chose Abram And brought him out from Ur of the Chaldees, And gave him the name Abraham.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	8	"You found his heart faithful before You, And made a covenant with him To give him the land of the Canaanite, Of the Hittite and the Amorite, Of the Perizzite, the Jebusite and the Girgashite-- To give it to his descendants. And You have fulfilled Your promise, For You are righteous.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	9	"You saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, And heard their cry by the Red Sea.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	10	"Then You performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh, Against all his servants and all the people of his land; For You knew that they acted arrogantly toward them, And made a name for Yourself as it is this day.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	11	"You divided the sea before them, So they passed through the midst of the sea on dry ground; And their pursuers You hurled into the depths, Like a stone into raging waters.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	12	"And with a pillar of cloud You led them by day, And with a pillar of fire by night To light for them the way In which they were to go.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	13	"Then You came down on Mount Sinai, And spoke with them from heaven; You gave them just ordinances and true laws, Good statutes and commandments.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	14	"So You made known to them Your holy sabbath, And laid down for them commandments, statutes and law, Through Your servant Moses.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	15	"You provided bread from heaven for them for their hunger, You brought forth water from a rock for them for their thirst, And You told them to enter in order to possess The land which You swore to give them.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	16	"But they, our fathers, acted arrogantly; They became stubborn and would not listen to Your commandments.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	17	"They refused to listen, And did not remember Your wondrous deeds which You had performed among them; So they became stubborn and appointed a leader to return to their slavery in Egypt. But You are a God of forgiveness, Gracious and compassionate, Slow to anger and abounding in lovingkindness; And You did not forsake them.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	18	"Even when they made for themselves A calf of molten metal And said, 'This is your God Who brought you up from Egypt,' And committed great blasphemies,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	19	You, in Your great compassion, Did not forsake them in the wilderness; The pillar of cloud did not leave them by day, To guide them on their way, Nor the pillar of fire by night, to light for them the way in which they were to go.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	20	"You gave Your good Spirit to instruct them, Your manna You did not withhold from their mouth, And You gave them water for their thirst.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	21	"Indeed, forty years You provided for them in the wilderness and they were not in want; Their clothes did not wear out, nor did their feet swell.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	22	"You also gave them kingdoms and peoples, And allotted them to them as a boundary. They took possession of the land of Sihon the king of Heshbon And the land of Og the king of Bashan.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	23	"You made their sons numerous as the stars of heaven, And You brought them into the land Which You had told their fathers to enter and possess.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	24	"So their sons entered and possessed the land. And You subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, And You gave them into their hand, with their kings and the peoples of the land, To do with them as they desired.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	25	"They captured fortified cities and a fertile land. They took possession of houses full of every good thing, Hewn cisterns, vineyards, olive groves, Fruit trees in abundance. So they ate, were filled and grew fat, And reveled in Your great goodness.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	26	"But they became disobedient and rebelled against You, And cast Your law behind their backs And killed Your prophets who had admonished them So that they might return to You, And they committed great blasphemies.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	27	"Therefore You delivered them into the hand of their oppressors who oppressed them, But when they cried to You in the time of their distress, You heard from heaven, and according to Your great compassion You gave them deliverers who delivered them from the hand of their oppressors.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	28	"But as soon as they had rest, they did evil again before You; Therefore You abandoned them to the hand of their enemies, so that they ruled over them. When they cried again to You, You heard from heaven, And many times You rescued them according to Your compassion,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	29	And admonished them in order to turn them back to Your law. Yet they acted arrogantly and did not listen to Your commandments but sinned against Your ordinances, By which if a man observes them he shall live. And they turned a stubborn shoulder and stiffened their neck, and would not listen.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	30	"However, You bore with them for many years, And admonished them by Your Spirit through Your prophets, Yet they would not give ear. Therefore You gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	31	"Nevertheless, in Your great compassion You did not make an end of them or forsake them, For You are a gracious and compassionate God.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	32	"Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keeps covenant and lovingkindness, Do not let all the hardship seem insignificant before You, Which has come upon us, our kings, our princes, our priests, our prophets, our fathers and on all Your people, From the days of the kings of Assyria to this day.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	33	"However, You are just in all that has come upon us; For You have dealt faithfully, but we have acted wickedly.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	34	"For our kings, our leaders, our priests and our fathers have not kept Your law Or paid attention to Your commandments and Your admonitions with which You have admonished them.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	35	"But they, in their own kingdom, With Your great goodness which You gave them, With the broad and rich land which You set before them, Did not serve You or turn from their evil deeds.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	36	"Behold, we are slaves today, And as to the land which You gave to our fathers to eat of its fruit and its bounty, Behold, we are slaves in it.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	37	"Its abundant produce is for the kings Whom You have set over us because of our sins; They also rule over our bodies And over our cattle as they please, So we are in great distress.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	9	38	"Now because of all this We are making an agreement in writing; And on the sealed document are the names of our leaders, our Levites and our priests."
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	1	Now on the sealed document were the names of: Nehemiah the governor, the son of Hacaliah, and Zedekiah,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	2	Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	3	Pashhur, Amariah, Malchijah,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	4	Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	5	Harim, Meremoth, Obadiah,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	6	Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	7	Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	8	Maaziah, Bilgai, Shemaiah. These were the priests.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	9	And the Levites: Jeshua the son of Azaniah, Binnui of the sons of Henadad, Kadmiel;
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	10	also their brothers Shebaniah, Hodiah, Kelita, Pelaiah, Hanan,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	11	Mica, Rehob, Hashabiah,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	12	Zaccur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	13	Hodiah, Bani, Beninu.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	14	The leaders of the people: Parosh, Pahath-moab, Elam, Zattu, Bani,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	15	Bunni, Azgad, Bebai,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	16	Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	17	Ater, Hezekiah, Azzur,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	18	Hodiah, Hashum, Bezai,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	19	Hariph, Anathoth, Nebai,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	20	Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	21	Meshezabel, Zadok, Jaddua,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	22	Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	23	Hoshea, Hananiah, Hasshub,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	24	Hallohesh, Pilha, Shobek,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	25	Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	26	Ahiah, Hanan, Anan,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	27	Malluch, Harim, Baanah.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	28	Now the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the temple servants and all those who had separated themselves from the peoples of the lands to the law of God, their wives, their sons and their daughters, all those who had knowledge and understanding,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	29	are joining with their kinsmen, their nobles, and are taking on themselves a curse and an oath to walk in God's law, which was given through Moses, God's servant, and to keep and to observe all the commandments of GOD our Lord, and His ordinances and His statutes;
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	30	and that we will not give our daughters to the peoples of the land or take their daughters for our sons.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	31	As for the peoples of the land who bring wares or any grain on the sabbath day to sell, we will not buy from them on the sabbath or a holy day; and we will forego the crops the seventh year and the exaction of every debt.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	32	We also placed ourselves under obligation to contribute yearly one third of a shekel for the service of the house of our God:
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	33	for the showbread, for the continual grain offering, for the continual burnt offering, the sabbaths, the new moon, for the appointed times, for the holy things and for the sin offerings to make atonement for Israel, and all the work of the house of our God.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	34	Likewise we cast lots for the supply of wood among the priests, the Levites and the people so that they might bring it to the house of our God, according to our fathers' households, at fixed times annually, to burn on the altar of the LORD our God, as it is written in the law;
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	35	and that they might bring the first fruits of our ground and the first fruits of all the fruit of every tree to the house of the LORD annually,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	36	and bring to the house of our God the firstborn of our sons and of our cattle, and the firstborn of our herds and our flocks as it is written in the law, for the priests who are ministering in the house of our God.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	37	We will also bring the first of our dough, our contributions, the fruit of every tree, the new wine and the oil to the priests at the chambers of the house of our God, and the tithe of our ground to the Levites, for the Levites are they who receive the tithes in all the rural towns.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	38	The priest, the son of Aaron, shall be with the Levites when the Levites receive tithes, and the Levites shall bring up the tenth of the tithes to the house of our God, to the chambers of the storehouse.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	10	39	For the sons of Israel and the sons of Levi shall bring the contribution of the grain, the new wine and the oil to the chambers; there are the utensils of the sanctuary, the priests who are ministering, the gatekeepers and the singers. Thus we will not neglect the house of our God.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	11	1	Now the leaders of the people lived in Jerusalem, but the rest of the people cast lots to bring one out of ten to live in Jerusalem, the holy city, while nine-tenths remained in the other cities.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	11	2	And the people blessed all the men who volunteered to live in Jerusalem.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	11	3	Now these are the heads of the provinces who lived in Jerusalem, but in the cities of Judah each lived on his own property in their cities--the Israelites, the priests, the Levites, the temple servants and the descendants of Solomon's servants.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	11	4	Some of the sons of Judah and some of the sons of Benjamin lived in Jerusalem. From the sons of Judah: Athaiah the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalalel, of the sons of Perez;
Nehemiah	Neh	16	11	5	and Maaseiah the son of Baruch, the son of Col-hozeh, the son of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zechariah, the son of the Shilonite.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	11	6	All the sons of Perez who lived in Jerusalem were able men.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	11	7	Now these are the sons of Benjamin: Sallu the son of Meshullam, the son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son of Kolaiah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of Jeshaiah;
Nehemiah	Neh	16	11	8	and after him Gabbai and Sallai, 928.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	11	9	Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer, and Judah the son of Hassenuah was second in command of the city.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	11	10	From the priests: Jedaiah the son of Joiarib, Jachin,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	11	11	Seraiah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the leader of the house of God,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	11	12	and their kinsmen who performed the work of the temple, 822; and Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pelaliah, the son of Amzi, the son of Zechariah, the son of Pashhur, the son of Malchijah,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	11	13	and his kinsmen, heads of fathers' households, 242; and Amashsai the son of Azarel, the son of Ahzai, the son of Meshillemoth, the son of Immer,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	11	14	and their brothers, valiant warriors, 128. And their overseer was Zabdiel, the son of Haggedolim.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	11	15	Now from the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni;
Nehemiah	Neh	16	11	16	and Shabbethai and Jozabad, from the leaders of the Levites, who were in charge of the outside work of the house of God;
Nehemiah	Neh	16	11	17	and Mattaniah the son of Mica, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph, who was the leader in beginning the thanksgiving at prayer, and Bakbukiah, the second among his brethren; and Abda the son of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	11	18	All the Levites in the holy city were 284.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	11	19	Also the gatekeepers, Akkub, Talmon and their brethren who kept watch at the gates, were 172.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	11	20	The rest of Israel, of the priests and of the Levites, were in all the cities of Judah, each on his own inheritance.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	11	21	But the temple servants were living in Ophel, and Ziha and Gishpa were in charge of the temple servants.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	11	22	Now the overseer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Mica, from the sons of Asaph, who were the singers for the service of the house of God.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	11	23	For there was a commandment from the king concerning them and a firm regulation for the song leaders day by day.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	11	24	Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel, of the sons of Zerah the son of Judah, was the king's representative in all matters concerning the people.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	11	25	Now as for the villages with their fields, some of the sons of Judah lived in Kiriath-arba and its towns, in Dibon and its towns, and in Jekabzeel and its villages,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	11	26	and in Jeshua, in Moladah and Beth-pelet,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	11	27	and in Hazar-shual, in Beersheba and its towns,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	11	28	and in Ziklag, in Meconah and in its towns,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	11	29	and in En-rimmon, in Zorah and in Jarmuth,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	11	30	Zanoah, Adullam, and their villages, Lachish and its fields, Azekah and its towns. So they encamped from Beersheba as far as the valley of Hinnom.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	11	31	The sons of Benjamin also lived from Geba onward, at Michmash and Aija, at Bethel and its towns,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	11	32	at Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	11	33	Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	11	34	Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	11	35	Lod and Ono, the valley of craftsmen.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	11	36	From the Levites, some divisions in Judah belonged to Benjamin.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	1	Now these are the priests and the Levites who came up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	2	Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	3	Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	4	Iddo, Ginnethoi, Abijah,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	5	Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	6	Shemaiah and Joiarib, Jedaiah,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	7	Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah and Jedaiah. These were the heads of the priests and their kinsmen in the days of Jeshua.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	8	The Levites were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah who was in charge of the songs of thanksgiving, he and his brothers.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	9	Also Bakbukiah and Unni, their brothers, stood opposite them in their service divisions.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	10	Jeshua became the father of Joiakim, and Joiakim became the father of Eliashib, and Eliashib became the father of Joiada,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	11	and Joiada became the father of Jonathan, and Jonathan became the father of Jaddua.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	12	Now in the days of Joiakim, the priests, the heads of fathers' households were: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	13	of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	14	of Malluchi, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph;
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	15	of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai;
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	16	of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam;
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	17	of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Piltai;
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	18	of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan;
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	19	of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi;
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	20	of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	21	of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethanel.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	22	As for the Levites, the heads of fathers' households were registered in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan and Jaddua; so were the priests in the reign of Darius the Persian.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	23	The sons of Levi, the heads of fathers' households, were registered in the Book of the Chronicles up to the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	24	The heads of the Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brothers opposite them, to praise and give thanks, as prescribed by David the man of God, division corresponding to division.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	25	Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon and Akkub were gatekeepers keeping watch at the storehouses of the gates.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	26	These served in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and of Ezra the priest and scribe.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	27	Now at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought out the Levites from all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem so that they might celebrate the dedication with gladness, with hymns of thanksgiving and with songs to the accompaniment of cymbals, harps and lyres.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	28	So the sons of the singers were assembled from the district around Jerusalem, and from the villages of the Netophathites,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	29	from Beth-gilgal and from their fields in Geba and Azmaveth, for the singers had built themselves villages around Jerusalem.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	30	The priests and the Levites purified themselves; they also purified the people, the gates and the wall.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	31	Then I had the leaders of Judah come up on top of the wall, and I appointed two great choirs, the first proceeding to the right on top of the wall toward the Refuse Gate.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	32	Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah followed them,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	33	with Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	34	Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	35	and some of the sons of the priests with trumpets; and Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	36	and his kinsmen, Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God. And Ezra the scribe went before them.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	37	At the Fountain Gate they went directly up the steps of the city of David by the stairway of the wall above the house of David to the Water Gate on the east.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	38	The second choir proceeded to the left, while I followed them with half of the people on the wall, above the Tower of Furnaces, to the Broad Wall,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	39	and above the Gate of Ephraim, by the Old Gate, by the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate; and they stopped at the Gate of the Guard.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	40	Then the two choirs took their stand in the house of God. So did I and half of the officials with me;
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	41	and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah and Hananiah, with the trumpets;
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	42	and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam and Ezer. And the singers sang, with Jezrahiah their leader,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	43	and on that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced because God had given them great joy, even the women and children rejoiced, so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard from afar.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	44	On that day men were also appointed over the chambers for the stores, the contributions, the first fruits and the tithes, to gather into them from the fields of the cities the portions required by the law for the priests and Levites; for Judah rejoiced over the priests and Levites who served.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	45	For they performed the worship of their God and the service of purification, together with the singers and the gatekeepers in accordance with the command of David and of his son Solomon.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	46	For in the days of David and Asaph, in ancient times, there were leaders of the singers, songs of praise and hymns of thanksgiving to God.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	12	47	So all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah gave the portions due the singers and the gatekeepers as each day required, and set apart the consecrated portion for the Levites, and the Levites set apart the consecrated portion for the sons of Aaron.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	13	1	On that day they read aloud from the book of Moses in the hearing of the people; and there was found written in it that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever enter the assembly of God,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	13	2	because they did not meet the sons of Israel with bread and water, but hired Balaam against them to curse them. However, our God turned the curse into a blessing.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	13	3	So when they heard the law, they excluded all foreigners from Israel.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	13	4	Now prior to this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, being related to Tobiah,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	13	5	had prepared a large room for him, where formerly they put the grain offerings, the frankincense, the utensils and the tithes of grain, wine and oil prescribed for the Levites, the singers and the gatekeepers, and the contributions for the priests.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	13	6	But during all this time I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I had gone to the king. After some time, however, I asked leave from the king,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	13	7	and I came to Jerusalem and learned about the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, by preparing a room for him in the courts of the house of God.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	13	8	It was very displeasing to me, so I threw all of Tobiah's household goods out of the room.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	13	9	Then I gave an order and they cleansed the rooms; and I returned there the utensils of the house of God with the grain offerings and the frankincense.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	13	10	I also discovered that the portions of the Levites had not been given them, so that the Levites and the singers who performed the service had gone away, each to his own field.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	13	11	So I reprimanded the officials and said, "Why is the house of God forsaken?" Then I gathered them together and restored them to their posts.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	13	12	All Judah then brought the tithe of the grain, wine and oil into the storehouses.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	13	13	In charge of the storehouses I appointed Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah of the Levites, and in addition to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were considered reliable, and it was their task to distribute to their kinsmen.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	13	14	Remember me for this, O my God, and do not blot out my loyal deeds which I have performed for the house of my God and its services.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	13	15	In those days I saw in Judah some who were treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sacks of grain and loading them on donkeys, as well as wine, grapes, figs and all kinds of loads, and they brought them into Jerusalem on the sabbath day. So I admonished them on the day they sold food.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	13	16	Also men of Tyre were living there who imported fish and all kinds of merchandise, and sold them to the sons of Judah on the sabbath, even in Jerusalem.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	13	17	Then I reprimanded the nobles of Judah and said to them, "What is this evil thing you are doing, by profaning the sabbath day?
Nehemiah	Neh	16	13	18	"Did not your fathers do the same, so that our God brought on us and on this city all this trouble? Yet you are adding to the wrath on Israel by profaning the sabbath."
Nehemiah	Neh	16	13	19	It came about that just as it grew dark at the gates of Jerusalem before the sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut and that they should not open them until after the sabbath. Then I stationed some of my servants at the gates so that no load would enter on the sabbath day.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	13	20	Once or twice the traders and merchants of every kind of merchandise spent the night outside Jerusalem.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	13	21	Then I warned them and said to them, "Why do you spend the night in front of the wall? If you do so again, I will use force against you." From that time on they did not come on the sabbath.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	13	22	And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves and come as gatekeepers to sanctify the sabbath day. For this also remember me, O my God, and have compassion on me according to the greatness of Your lovingkindness.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	13	23	In those days I also saw that the Jews had married women from Ashdod, Ammon and Moab.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	13	24	As for their children, half spoke in the language of Ashdod, and none of them was able to speak the language of Judah, but the language of his own people.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	13	25	So I contended with them and cursed them and struck some of them and pulled out their hair, and made them swear by God, "You shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor take of their daughters for your sons or for yourselves.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	13	26	"Did not Solomon king of Israel sin regarding these things? Yet among the many nations there was no king like him, and he was loved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel; nevertheless the foreign women caused even him to sin.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	13	27	"Do we then hear about you that you have committed all this great evil by acting unfaithfully against our God by marrying foreign women?"
Nehemiah	Neh	16	13	28	Even one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was a son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite, so I drove him away from me.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	13	29	Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites.
Nehemiah	Neh	16	13	30	Thus I purified them from everything foreign and appointed duties for the priests and the Levites, each in his task,
Nehemiah	Neh	16	13	31	and I arranged for the supply of wood at appointed times and for the first fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.
Esther	Est	17	1	1	Now it took place in the days of Ahasuerus, the Ahasuerus who reigned from India to Ethiopia over provinces,
Esther	Est	17	1	2	in those days as King Ahasuerus sat on his royal throne which was at the citadel in Susa,
Esther	Est	17	1	3	in the third year of his reign he gave a banquet for all his princes and attendants, the army officers of Persia and Media, the nobles and the princes of his provinces being in his presence.
Esther	Est	17	1	4	And he displayed the riches of his royal glory and the splendor of his great majesty for many days, days.
Esther	Est	17	1	5	When these days were completed, the king gave a banquet lasting seven days for all the people who were present at the citadel in Susa, from the greatest to the least, in the court of the garden of the king's palace.
Esther	Est	17	1	6	There were hangings of fine white and violet linen held by cords of fine purple linen on silver rings and marble columns, and couches of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl and precious stones.
Esther	Est	17	1	7	Drinks were served in golden vessels of various kinds, and the royal wine was plentiful according to the king's bounty.
Esther	Est	17	1	8	The drinking was done according to the law, there was no compulsion, for so the king had given orders to each official of his household that he should do according to the desires of each person.
Esther	Est	17	1	9	Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in the palace which belonged to King Ahasuerus.
Esther	Est	17	1	10	On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar and Carkas, the seven eunuchs who served in the presence of King Ahasuerus,
Esther	Est	17	1	11	to bring Queen Vashti before the king with her royal crown in order to display her beauty to the people and the princes, for she was beautiful.
Esther	Est	17	1	12	But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king's command delivered by the eunuchs. Then the king became very angry and his wrath burned within him.
Esther	Est	17	1	13	Then the king said to the wise men who understood the times--for it was the custom of the king so to speak before all who knew law and justice
Esther	Est	17	1	14	and were close to him: Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media who had access to the king's presence and sat in the first place in the kingdom--
Esther	Est	17	1	15	"According to law, what is to be done with Queen Vashti, because she did not obey the command of King Ahasuerus delivered by the eunuchs?"
Esther	Est	17	1	16	In the presence of the king and the princes, Memucan said, "Queen Vashti has wronged not only the king but also all the princes and all the peoples who are in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus.
Esther	Est	17	1	17	"For the queen's conduct will become known to all the women causing them to look with contempt on their husbands by saying, 'King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought in to his presence, but she did not come.'
Esther	Est	17	1	18	"This day the ladies of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen's conduct will speak in the same way to all the king's princes, and there will be plenty of contempt and anger.
Esther	Est	17	1	19	"If it pleases the king, let a royal edict be issued by him and let it be written in the laws of Persia and Media so that it cannot be repealed, that Vashti may no longer come into the presence of King Ahasuerus, and let the king give her royal position to another who is more worthy than she.
Esther	Est	17	1	20	"When the king's edict which he will make is heard throughout all his kingdom, great as it is, then all women will give honor to their husbands, great and small."
Esther	Est	17	1	21	This word pleased the king and the princes, and the king did as Memucan proposed.
Esther	Est	17	1	22	So he sent letters to all the king's provinces, to each province according to its script and to every people according to their language, that every man should be the master in his own house and the one who speaks in the language of his own people.
Esther	Est	17	2	1	After these things when the anger of King Ahasuerus had subsided, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what had been decreed against her.
Esther	Est	17	2	2	Then the king's attendants, who served him, said, "Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king.
Esther	Est	17	2	3	"Let the king appoint overseers in all the provinces of his kingdom that they may gather every beautiful young virgin to the citadel of Susa, to the harem, into the custody of Hegai, the king's eunuch, who is in charge of the women; and let their cosmetics be given them.
Esther	Est	17	2	4	"Then let the young lady who pleases the king be queen in place of Vashti." And the matter pleased the king, and he did accordingly.
Esther	Est	17	2	5	Now there was at the citadel in Susa a Jew whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite,
Esther	Est	17	2	6	who had been taken into exile from Jerusalem with the captives who had been exiled with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had exiled.
Esther	Est	17	2	7	He was bringing up Hadassah, that is Esther, his uncle's daughter, for she had no father or mother. Now the young lady was beautiful of form and face, and when her father and her mother died, Mordecai took her as his own daughter.
Esther	Est	17	2	8	So it came about when the command and decree of the king were heard and many young ladies were gathered to the citadel of Susa into the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken to the king's palace into the custody of Hegai, who was in charge of the women.
Esther	Est	17	2	9	Now the young lady pleased him and found favor with him. So he quickly provided her with her cosmetics and food, gave her seven choice maids from the king's palace and transferred her and her maids to the best place in the harem.
Esther	Est	17	2	10	Esther did not make known her people or her kindred, for Mordecai had instructed her that she should not make them known.
Esther	Est	17	2	11	Every day Mordecai walked back and forth in front of the court of the harem to learn how Esther was and how she fared.
Esther	Est	17	2	12	Now when the turn of each young lady came to go in to King Ahasuerus, after the end of her twelve months under the regulations for the women--for the days of their beautification were completed as follows: six months with oil of myrrh and six months with spices and the cosmetics for women--
Esther	Est	17	2	13	the young lady would go in to the king in this way: anything that she desired was given her to take with her from the harem to the king's palace.
Esther	Est	17	2	14	In the evening she would go in and in the morning she would return to the second harem, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's eunuch who was in charge of the concubines. She would not again go in to the king unless the king delighted in her and she was summoned by name.
Esther	Est	17	2	15	Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai who had taken her as his daughter, came to go in to the king, she did not request anything except what Hegai, the king's eunuch who was in charge of the women, advised. And Esther found favor in the eyes of all who saw her.
Esther	Est	17	2	16	So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus to his royal palace in the tenth month which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
Esther	Est	17	2	17	The king loved Esther more than all the women, and she found favor and kindness with him more than all the virgins, so that he set the royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.
Esther	Est	17	2	18	Then the king gave a great banquet, Esther's banquet, for all his princes and his servants; he also made a holiday for the provinces and gave gifts according to the king's bounty.
Esther	Est	17	2	19	When the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate.
Esther	Est	17	2	20	Esther had not yet made known her kindred or her people, even as Mordecai had commanded her; for Esther did what Mordecai told her as she had done when under his care.
Esther	Est	17	2	21	In those days, while Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king's officials from those who guarded the door, became angry and sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus.
Esther	Est	17	2	22	But the plot became known to Mordecai and he told Queen Esther, and Esther informed the king in Mordecai's name.
Esther	Est	17	2	23	Now when the plot was investigated and found to be so, they were both hanged on a gallows; and it was written in the Book of the Chronicles in the king's presence.
Esther	Est	17	3	1	After these events King Ahasuerus promoted Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him and established his authority over all the princes who were with him.
Esther	Est	17	3	2	All the king's servants who were at the king's gate bowed down and paid homage to Haman; for so the king had commanded concerning him. But Mordecai neither bowed down nor paid homage.
Esther	Est	17	3	3	Then the king's servants who were at the king's gate said to Mordecai, "Why are you transgressing the king's command?"
Esther	Est	17	3	4	Now it was when they had spoken daily to him and he would not listen to them, that they told Haman to see whether Mordecai's reason would stand; for he had told them that he was a Jew.
Esther	Est	17	3	5	When Haman saw that Mordecai neither bowed down nor paid homage to him, Haman was filled with rage.
Esther	Est	17	3	6	But he disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had told him who the people of Mordecai were; therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews, the people of Mordecai, who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus.
Esther	Est	17	3	7	In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, Pur, that is the lot, was cast before Haman from day to day and from month to month, until the twelfth month, that is the month Adar.
Esther	Est	17	3	8	Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, "There is a certain people scattered and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom; their laws are different from those of all other people and they do not observe the king's laws, so it is not in the king's interest to let them remain.
Esther	Est	17	3	9	"If it is pleasing to the king, let it be decreed that they be destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who carry on the king's business, to put into the king's treasuries."
Esther	Est	17	3	10	Then the king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews.
Esther	Est	17	3	11	The king said to Haman, "The silver is yours, and the people also, to do with them as you please."
Esther	Est	17	3	12	Then the king's scribes were summoned on the thirteenth day of the first month, and it was written just as Haman commanded to the king's satraps, to the governors who were over each province and to the princes of each people, each province according to its script, each people according to its language, being written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with the king's signet ring.
Esther	Est	17	3	13	Letters were sent by couriers to all the king's provinces to destroy, to kill and to annihilate all the Jews, both young and old, women and children, in one day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to seize their possessions as plunder.
Esther	Est	17	3	14	A copy of the edict to be issued as law in every province was published to all the peoples so that they should be ready for this day.
Esther	Est	17	3	15	The couriers went out impelled by the king's command while the decree was issued at the citadel in Susa; and while the king and Haman sat down to drink, the city of Susa was in confusion.
Esther	Est	17	4	1	When Mordecai learned all that had been done, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the midst of the city and wailed loudly and bitterly.
Esther	Est	17	4	2	He went as far as the king's gate, for no one was to enter the king's gate clothed in sackcloth.
Esther	Est	17	4	3	In each and every province where the command and decree of the king came, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping and wailing; and many lay on sackcloth and ashes.
Esther	Est	17	4	4	Then Esther's maidens and her eunuchs came and told her, and the queen writhed in great anguish. And she sent garments to clothe Mordecai that he might remove his sackcloth from him, but he did not accept them.
Esther	Est	17	4	5	Then Esther summoned Hathach from the king's eunuchs, whom the king had appointed to attend her, and ordered him to go to Mordecai to learn what this was and why it was.
Esther	Est	17	4	6	So Hathach went out to Mordecai to the city square in front of the king's gate.
Esther	Est	17	4	7	Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, and the exact amount of money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the destruction of the Jews.
Esther	Est	17	4	8	He also gave him a copy of the text of the edict which had been issued in Susa for their destruction, that he might show Esther and inform her, and to order her to go in to the king to implore his favor and to plead with him for her people.
Esther	Est	17	4	9	Hathach came back and related Mordecai's words to Esther.
Esther	Est	17	4	10	Then Esther spoke to Hathach and ordered him to reply to Mordecai:
Esther	Est	17	4	11	"All the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces know that for any man or woman who comes to the king to the inner court who is not summoned, he has but one law, that he be put to death, unless the king holds out to him the golden scepter so that he may live. And I have not been summoned to come to the king for these thirty days."
Esther	Est	17	4	12	They related Esther's words to Mordecai.
Esther	Est	17	4	13	Then Mordecai told them to reply to Esther, "Do not imagine that you in the king's palace can escape any more than all the Jews.
Esther	Est	17	4	14	"For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place and you and your father's house will perish. And who knows whether you have not attained royalty for such a time as this?"
Esther	Est	17	4	15	Then Esther told them to reply to Mordecai,
Esther	Est	17	4	16	"Go, assemble all the Jews who are found in Susa, and fast for me; do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my maidens also will fast in the same way. And thus I will go in to the king, which is not according to the law; and if I perish, I perish."
Esther	Est	17	4	17	So Mordecai went away and did just as Esther had commanded him.
Esther	Est	17	5	1	Now it came about on the third day that Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the king's palace in front of the king's rooms, and the king was sitting on his royal throne in the throne room, opposite the entrance to the palace.
Esther	Est	17	5	2	When the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, she obtained favor in his sight; and the king extended to Esther the golden scepter which was in his hand. So Esther came near and touched the top of the scepter.
Esther	Est	17	5	3	Then the king said to her, "What is troubling you, Queen Esther? And what is your request? Even to half of the kingdom it shall be given to you."
Esther	Est	17	5	4	Esther said, "If it pleases the king, may the king and Haman come this day to the banquet that I have prepared for him."
Esther	Est	17	5	5	Then the king said, "Bring Haman quickly that we may do as Esther desires." So the king and Haman came to the banquet which Esther had prepared.
Esther	Est	17	5	6	As they drank their wine at the banquet, the king said to Esther, "What is your petition, for it shall be granted to you. And what is your request? Even to half of the kingdom it shall be done."
Esther	Est	17	5	7	So Esther replied, "My petition and my request is:
Esther	Est	17	5	8	if I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and do what I request, may the king and Haman come to the banquet which I will prepare for them, and tomorrow I will do as the king says."
Esther	Est	17	5	9	Then Haman went out that day glad and pleased of heart; but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate and that he did not stand up or tremble before him, Haman was filled with anger against Mordecai.
Esther	Est	17	5	10	Haman controlled himself, however, went to his house and sent for his friends and his wife Zeresh.
Esther	Est	17	5	11	Then Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches, and the number of his sons, and every instance where the king had magnified him and how he had promoted him above the princes and servants of the king.
Esther	Est	17	5	12	Haman also said, "Even Esther the queen let no one but me come with the king to the banquet which she had prepared; and tomorrow also I am invited by her with the king.
Esther	Est	17	5	13	"Yet all of this does not satisfy me every time I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate."
Esther	Est	17	5	14	Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him, "Have a gallows fifty cubits high made and in the morning ask the king to have Mordecai hanged on it; then go joyfully with the king to the banquet." And the advice pleased Haman, so he had the gallows made.
Esther	Est	17	6	1	During that night the king could not sleep so he gave an order to bring the book of records, the chronicles, and they were read before the king.
Esther	Est	17	6	2	It was found written what Mordecai had reported concerning Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs who were doorkeepers, that they had sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus.
Esther	Est	17	6	3	The king said, "What honor or dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this?" Then the king's servants who attended him said, "Nothing has been done for him."
Esther	Est	17	6	4	So the king said, "Who is in the court?" Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the king's palace in order to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows which he had prepared for him.
Esther	Est	17	6	5	The king's servants said to him, "Behold, Haman is standing in the court." And the king said, "Let him come in."
Esther	Est	17	6	6	So Haman came in and the king said to him, "What is to be done for the man whom the king desires to honor?" And Haman said to himself, "Whom would the king desire to honor more than me?"
Esther	Est	17	6	7	Then Haman said to the king, "For the man whom the king desires to honor,
Esther	Est	17	6	8	let them bring a royal robe which the king has worn, and the horse on which the king has ridden, and on whose head a royal crown has been placed;
Esther	Est	17	6	9	and let the robe and the horse be handed over to one of the king's most noble princes and let them array the man whom the king desires to honor and lead him on horseback through the city square, and proclaim before him, 'Thus it shall be done to the man whom the king desires to honor.'"
Esther	Est	17	6	10	Then the king said to Haman, "Take quickly the robes and the horse as you have said, and do so for Mordecai the Jew, who is sitting at the king's gate; do not fall short in anything of all that you have said."
Esther	Est	17	6	11	So Haman took the robe and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and led him on horseback through the city square, and proclaimed before him, "Thus it shall be done to the man whom the king desires to honor."
Esther	Est	17	6	12	Then Mordecai returned to the king's gate. But Haman hurried home, mourning, with his head covered.
Esther	Est	17	6	13	Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to him. Then his wise men and Zeresh his wife said to him, "If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of Jewish origin, you will not overcome him, but will surely fall before him."
Esther	Est	17	6	14	While they were still talking with him, the king's eunuchs arrived and hastily brought Haman to the banquet which Esther had prepared.
Esther	Est	17	7	1	Now the king and Haman came to drink wine with Esther the queen.
Esther	Est	17	7	2	And the king said to Esther on the second day also as they drank their wine at the banquet, "What is your petition, Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to half of the kingdom it shall be done."
Esther	Est	17	7	3	Then Queen Esther replied, "If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be given me as my petition, and my people as my request;
Esther	Est	17	7	4	for we have been sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be killed and to be annihilated. Now if we had only been sold as slaves, men and women, I would have remained silent, for the trouble would not be commensurate with the annoyance to the king."
Esther	Est	17	7	5	Then King Ahasuerus asked Queen Esther, "Who is he, and where is he, who would presume to do thus?"
Esther	Est	17	7	6	Esther said, "A foe and an enemy is this wicked Haman!" Then Haman became terrified before the king and queen.
Esther	Est	17	7	7	The king arose in his anger from drinking wine and went into the palace garden; but Haman stayed to beg for his life from Queen Esther, for he saw that harm had been determined against him by the king.
Esther	Est	17	7	8	Now when the king returned from the palace garden into the place where they were drinking wine, Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was. Then the king said, "Will he even assault the queen with me in the house?" As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.
Esther	Est	17	7	9	Then Harbonah, one of the eunuchs who were before the king said, "Behold indeed, the gallows standing at Haman's house fifty cubits high, which Haman made for Mordecai who spoke good on behalf of the king!" And the king said, "Hang him on it."
Esther	Est	17	7	10	So they hanged Haman on the gallows which he had prepared for Mordecai, and the king's anger subsided.
Esther	Est	17	8	1	On that day King Ahasuerus gave the house of Haman, the enemy of the Jews, to Queen Esther; and Mordecai came before the king, for Esther had disclosed what he was to her.
Esther	Est	17	8	2	The king took off his signet ring which he had taken away from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.
Esther	Est	17	8	3	Then Esther spoke again to the king, fell at his feet, wept and implored him to avert the evil scheme of Haman the Agagite and his plot which he had devised against the Jews.
Esther	Est	17	8	4	The king extended the golden scepter to Esther. So Esther arose and stood before the king.
Esther	Est	17	8	5	Then she said, "If it pleases the king and if I have found favor before him and the matter seems proper to the king and I am pleasing in his sight, let it be written to revoke the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the king's provinces.
Esther	Est	17	8	6	"For how can I endure to see the calamity which will befall my people, and how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?"
Esther	Est	17	8	7	So King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, "Behold, I have given the house of Haman to Esther, and him they have hanged on the gallows because he had stretched out his hands against the Jews.
Esther	Est	17	8	8	"Now you write to the Jews as you see fit, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's signet ring; for a decree which is written in the name of the king and sealed with the king's signet ring may not be revoked."
Esther	Est	17	8	9	So the king's scribes were called at that time in the third month (that is, the month Sivan), on the twenty-third day; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded to the Jews, the satraps, the governors and the princes of the provinces which extended from India to Ethiopia, provinces, to every province according to its script, and to every people according to their language as well as to the Jews according to their script and their language.
Esther	Est	17	8	10	He wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, and sealed it with the king's signet ring, and sent letters by couriers on horses, riding on steeds sired by the royal stud.
Esther	Est	17	8	11	In them the king granted the Jews who were in each and every city the right to assemble and to defend their lives, to destroy, to kill and to annihilate the entire army of any people or province which might attack them, including children and women, and to plunder their spoil,
Esther	Est	17	8	12	on one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month (that is, the month Adar).
Esther	Est	17	8	13	A copy of the edict to be issued as law in each and every province was published to all the peoples, so that the Jews would be ready for this day to avenge themselves on their enemies.
Esther	Est	17	8	14	The couriers, hastened and impelled by the king's command, went out, riding on the royal steeds; and the decree was given out at the citadel in Susa.
Esther	Est	17	8	15	Then Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal robes of blue and white, with a large crown of gold and a garment of fine linen and purple; and the city of Susa shouted and rejoiced.
Esther	Est	17	8	16	For the Jews there was light and gladness and joy and honor.
Esther	Est	17	8	17	In each and every province and in each and every city, wherever the king's commandment and his decree arrived, there was gladness and joy for the Jews, a feast and a holiday. And many among the peoples of the land became Jews, for the dread of the Jews had fallen on them.
Esther	Est	17	9	1	Now in the twelfth month (that is, the month Adar), on the thirteenth day when the king's command and edict were about to be executed, on the day when the enemies of the Jews hoped to gain the mastery over them, it was turned to the contrary so that the Jews themselves gained the mastery over those who hated them.
Esther	Est	17	9	2	The Jews assembled in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to lay hands on those who sought their harm; and no one could stand before them, for the dread of them had fallen on all the peoples.
Esther	Est	17	9	3	Even all the princes of the provinces, the satraps, the governors and those who were doing the king's business assisted the Jews, because the dread of Mordecai had fallen on them.
Esther	Est	17	9	4	Indeed, Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame spread throughout all the provinces; for the man Mordecai became greater and greater.
Esther	Est	17	9	5	Thus the Jews struck all their enemies with the sword, killing and destroying; and they did what they pleased to those who hated them.
Esther	Est	17	9	6	At the citadel in Susa the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men,
Esther	Est	17	9	7	and Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,
Esther	Est	17	9	8	Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,
Esther	Est	17	9	9	Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai and Vaizatha,
Esther	Est	17	9	10	the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jews' enemy; but they did not lay their hands on the plunder.
Esther	Est	17	9	11	On that day the number of those who were killed at the citadel in Susa was reported to the king.
Esther	Est	17	9	12	The king said to Queen Esther, "The Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men and the ten sons of Haman at the citadel in Susa. What then have they done in the rest of the king's provinces! Now what is your petition? It shall even be granted you. And what is your further request? It shall also be done."
Esther	Est	17	9	13	Then said Esther, "If it pleases the king, let tomorrow also be granted to the Jews who are in Susa to do according to the edict of today; and let Haman's ten sons be hanged on the gallows."
Esther	Est	17	9	14	So the king commanded that it should be done so; and an edict was issued in Susa, and Haman's ten sons were hanged.
Esther	Est	17	9	15	The Jews who were in Susa assembled also on the fourteenth day of the month Adar and killed three hundred men in Susa, but they did not lay their hands on the plunder.
Esther	Est	17	9	16	Now the rest of the Jews who were in the king's provinces assembled, to defend their lives and rid themselves of their enemies, and kill 75,of those who hated them; but they did not lay their hands on the plunder.
Esther	Est	17	9	17	This was done on the thirteenth day of the month Adar, and on the fourteenth day they rested and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing.
Esther	Est	17	9	18	But the Jews who were in Susa assembled on the thirteenth and the fourteenth of the same month, and they rested on the fifteenth day and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing.
Esther	Est	17	9	19	Therefore the Jews of the rural areas, who live in the rural towns, make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a holiday for rejoicing and feasting and sending portions of food to one another.
Esther	Est	17	9	20	Then Mordecai recorded these events, and he sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, both near and far,
Esther	Est	17	9	21	obliging them to celebrate the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same month, annually,
Esther	Est	17	9	22	because on those days the Jews rid themselves of their enemies, and it was a month which was turned for them from sorrow into gladness and from mourning into a holiday; that they should make them days of feasting and rejoicing and sending portions of food to one another and gifts to the poor.
Esther	Est	17	9	23	Thus the Jews undertook what they had started to do, and what Mordecai had written to them.
Esther	Est	17	9	24	For Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the adversary of all the Jews, had schemed against the Jews to destroy them and had cast Pur, that is the lot, to disturb them and destroy them.
Esther	Est	17	9	25	But when it came to the king's attention, he commanded by letter that his wicked scheme which he had devised against the Jews, should return on his own head and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.
Esther	Est	17	9	26	Therefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. And because of the instructions in this letter, both what they had seen in this regard and what had happened to them,
Esther	Est	17	9	27	the Jews established and made a custom for themselves and for their descendants and for all those who allied themselves with them, so that they would not fail to celebrate these two days according to their regulation and according to their appointed time annually.
Esther	Est	17	9	28	So these days were to be remembered and celebrated throughout every generation, every family, every province and every city; and these days of Purim were not to fail from among the Jews, or their memory fade from their descendants.
Esther	Est	17	9	29	Then Queen Esther, daughter of Abihail, with Mordecai the Jew, wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter about Purim.
Esther	Est	17	9	30	He sent letters to all the Jews, to the provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, namely, words of peace and truth,
Esther	Est	17	9	31	to establish these days of Purim at their appointed times, just as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had established for them, and just as they had established for themselves and for their descendants with instructions for their times of fasting and their lamentations.
Esther	Est	17	9	32	The command of Esther established these customs for Purim, and it was written in the book.
Esther	Est	17	10	1	Now King Ahasuerus laid a tribute on the land and on the coastlands of the sea.
Esther	Est	17	10	2	And all the accomplishments of his authority and strength, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai to which the king advanced him, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Media and Persia?
Esther	Est	17	10	3	For Mordecai the Jew was second only to King Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews and in favor with his many kinsmen, one who sought the good of his people and one who spoke for the welfare of his whole nation.
Job	Job	18	1	1	There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was blameless, upright, fearing God and turning away from evil.
Job	Job	18	1	2	Seven sons and three daughters were born to him.
Job	Job	18	1	3	His possessions also were 7,sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, 500 female donkeys, and very many servants; and that man was the greatest of all the men of the east.
Job	Job	18	1	4	His sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one on his day, and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
Job	Job	18	1	5	When the days of feasting had completed their cycle, Job would send and consecrate them, rising up early in the morning and offering burnt offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said, "Perhaps my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts." Thus Job did continually.
Job	Job	18	1	6	Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them.
Job	Job	18	1	7	The LORD said to Satan, "From where do you come?" Then Satan answered the LORD and said, "From roaming about on the earth and walking around on it."
Job	Job	18	1	8	The LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered My servant Job? For there is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, fearing God and turning away from evil."
Job	Job	18	1	9	Then Satan answered the LORD, "Does Job fear God for nothing?
Job	Job	18	1	10	"Have You not made a hedge about him and his house and all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land.
Job	Job	18	1	11	"But put forth Your hand now and touch all that he has; he will surely curse You to Your face."
Job	Job	18	1	12	Then the LORD said to Satan, "Behold, all that he has is in your power, only do not put forth your hand on him." So Satan departed from the presence of the LORD.
Job	Job	18	1	13	Now on the day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house,
Job	Job	18	1	14	a messenger came to Job and said, "The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them,
Job	Job	18	1	15	and the Sabeans attacked and took them. They also slew the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you."
Job	Job	18	1	16	While he was still speaking, another also came and said, "The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you."
Job	Job	18	1	17	While he was still speaking, another also came and said, "The Chaldeans formed three bands and made a raid on the camels and took them and slew the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you."
Job	Job	18	1	18	While he was still speaking, another also came and said, "Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house,
Job	Job	18	1	19	and behold, a great wind came from across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people and they died, and I alone have escaped to tell you."
Job	Job	18	1	20	Then Job arose and tore his robe and shaved his head, and he fell to the ground and worshiped.
Job	Job	18	1	21	He said, "Naked I came from my mother's womb, And naked I shall return there. The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away. Blessed be the name of the LORD."
Job	Job	18	1	22	Through all this Job did not sin nor did he blame God.
Job	Job	18	2	1	Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them to present himself before the LORD.
Job	Job	18	2	2	The LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Then Satan answered the LORD and said, "From roaming about on the earth and walking around on it."
Job	Job	18	2	3	The LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered My servant Job? For there is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man fearing God and turning away from evil. And he still holds fast his integrity, although you incited Me against him to ruin him without cause."
Job	Job	18	2	4	Satan answered the LORD and said, "Skin for skin! Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life.
Job	Job	18	2	5	"However, put forth Your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh; he will curse You to Your face."
Job	Job	18	2	6	So the LORD said to Satan, "Behold, he is in your power, only spare his life."
Job	Job	18	2	7	Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.
Job	Job	18	2	8	And he took a potsherd to scrape himself while he was sitting among the ashes.
Job	Job	18	2	9	Then his wife said to him, "Do you still hold fast your integrity? Curse God and die!"
Job	Job	18	2	10	But he said to her, "You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. Shall we indeed accept good from God and not accept adversity?" In all this Job did not sin with his lips.
Job	Job	18	2	11	Now when Job's three friends heard of all this adversity that had come upon him, they came each one from his own place, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made an appointment together to come to sympathize with him and comfort him.
Job	Job	18	2	12	When they lifted up their eyes at a distance and did not recognize him, they raised their voices and wept. And each of them tore his robe and they threw dust over their heads toward the sky.
Job	Job	18	2	13	Then they sat down on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights with no one speaking a word to him, for they saw that his pain was very great.
Job	Job	18	3	1	Afterward Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.
Job	Job	18	3	2	And Job said,
Job	Job	18	3	3	"Let the day perish on which I was to be born, And the night which said, 'A boy is conceived.'
Job	Job	18	3	4	"May that day be darkness; Let not God above care for it, Nor light shine on it.
Job	Job	18	3	5	"Let darkness and black gloom claim it; Let a cloud settle on it; Let the blackness of the day terrify it.
Job	Job	18	3	6	"As for that night, let darkness seize it; Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; Let it not come into the number of the months.
Job	Job	18	3	7	"Behold, let that night be barren; Let no joyful shout enter it.
Job	Job	18	3	8	"Let those curse it who curse the day, Who are prepared to rouse Leviathan.
Job	Job	18	3	9	"Let the stars of its twilight be darkened; Let it wait for light but have none, And let it not see the breaking dawn;
Job	Job	18	3	10	Because it did not shut the opening of my mother's womb, Or hide trouble from my eyes.
Job	Job	18	3	11	"Why did I not die at birth, Come forth from the womb and expire?
Job	Job	18	3	12	"Why did the knees receive me, And why the breasts, that I should suck?
Job	Job	18	3	13	"For now I would have lain down and been quiet; I would have slept then, I would have been at rest,
Job	Job	18	3	14	With kings and with counselors of the earth, Who rebuilt ruins for themselves;
Job	Job	18	3	15	Or with princes who had gold, Who were filling their houses with silver.
Job	Job	18	3	16	"Or like a miscarriage which is discarded, I would not be, As infants that never saw light.
Job	Job	18	3	17	"There the wicked cease from raging, And there the weary are at rest.
Job	Job	18	3	18	"The prisoners are at ease together; They do not hear the voice of the taskmaster.
Job	Job	18	3	19	"The small and the great are there, And the slave is free from his master.
Job	Job	18	3	20	"Why is light given to him who suffers, And life to the bitter of soul,
Job	Job	18	3	21	Who long for death, but there is none, And dig for it more than for hidden treasures,
Job	Job	18	3	22	Who rejoice greatly, And exult when they find the grave?
Job	Job	18	3	23	"Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden, And whom God has hedged in?
Job	Job	18	3	24	"For my groaning comes at the sight of my food, And my cries pour out like water.
Job	Job	18	3	25	"For what I fear comes upon me, And what I dread befalls me.
Job	Job	18	3	26	"I am not at ease, nor am I quiet, And I am not at rest, but turmoil comes."
Job	Job	18	4	1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,
Job	Job	18	4	2	"If one ventures a word with you, will you become impatient? But who can refrain from speaking?
Job	Job	18	4	3	"Behold you have admonished many, And you have strengthened weak hands.
Job	Job	18	4	4	"Your words have helped the tottering to stand, And you have strengthened feeble knees.
Job	Job	18	4	5	"But now it has come to you, and you are impatient; It touches you, and you are dismayed.
Job	Job	18	4	6	"Is not your fear of God your confidence, And the integrity of your ways your hope?
Job	Job	18	4	7	"Remember now, who ever perished being innocent? Or where were the upright destroyed?
Job	Job	18	4	8	"According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity And those who sow trouble harvest it.
Job	Job	18	4	9	"By the breath of God they perish, And by the blast of His anger they come to an end.
Job	Job	18	4	10	"The roaring of the lion and the voice of the fierce lion, And the teeth of the young lions are broken.
Job	Job	18	4	11	"The lion perishes for lack of prey, And the whelps of the lioness are scattered.
Job	Job	18	4	12	"Now a word was brought to me stealthily, And my ear received a whisper of it.
Job	Job	18	4	13	"Amid disquieting thoughts from the visions of the night, When deep sleep falls on men,
Job	Job	18	4	14	Dread came upon me, and trembling, And made all my bones shake.
Job	Job	18	4	15	"Then a spirit passed by my face; The hair of my flesh bristled up.
Job	Job	18	4	16	"It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance; A form was before my eyes; There was silence, then I heard a voice:
Job	Job	18	4	17	'Can mankind be just before God? Can a man be pure before his Maker?
Job	Job	18	4	18	'He puts no trust even in His servants; And against His angels He charges error.
Job	Job	18	4	19	'How much more those who dwell in houses of clay, Whose foundation is in the dust, Who are crushed before the moth!
Job	Job	18	4	20	'Between morning and evening they are broken in pieces; Unobserved, they perish forever.
Job	Job	18	4	21	'Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them? They die, yet without wisdom.'
Job	Job	18	5	1	"Call now, is there anyone who will answer you? And to which of the holy ones will you turn?
Job	Job	18	5	2	"For anger slays the foolish man, And jealousy kills the simple.
Job	Job	18	5	3	"I have seen the foolish taking root, And I cursed his abode immediately.
Job	Job	18	5	4	"His sons are far from safety, They are even oppressed in the gate, And there is no deliverer.
Job	Job	18	5	5	"His harvest the hungry devour And take it to a place of thorns, And the schemer is eager for their wealth.
Job	Job	18	5	6	"For affliction does not come from the dust, Nor does trouble sprout from the ground,
Job	Job	18	5	7	For man is born for trouble, As sparks fly upward.
Job	Job	18	5	8	"But as for me, I would seek God, And I would place my cause before God;
Job	Job	18	5	9	Who does great and unsearchable things, Wonders without number.
Job	Job	18	5	10	"He gives rain on the earth And sends water on the fields,
Job	Job	18	5	11	So that He sets on high those who are lowly, And those who mourn are lifted to safety.
Job	Job	18	5	12	"He frustrates the plotting of the shrewd, So that their hands cannot attain success.
Job	Job	18	5	13	"He captures the wise by their own shrewdness, And the advice of the cunning is quickly thwarted.
Job	Job	18	5	14	"By day they meet with darkness, And grope at noon as in the night.
Job	Job	18	5	15	"But He saves from the sword of their mouth, And the poor from the hand of the mighty.
Job	Job	18	5	16	"So the helpless has hope, And unrighteousness must shut its mouth.
Job	Job	18	5	17	"Behold, how happy is the man whom God reproves, So do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.
Job	Job	18	5	18	"For He inflicts pain, and gives relief; He wounds, and His hands also heal.
Job	Job	18	5	19	"From six troubles He will deliver you, Even in seven evil will not touch you.
Job	Job	18	5	20	"In famine He will redeem you from death, And in war from the power of the sword.
Job	Job	18	5	21	"You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, And you will not be afraid of violence when it comes.
Job	Job	18	5	22	"You will laugh at violence and famine, And you will not be afraid of wild beasts.
Job	Job	18	5	23	"For you will be in league with the stones of the field, And the beasts of the field will be at peace with you.
Job	Job	18	5	24	"You will know that your tent is secure, For you will visit your abode and fear no loss.
Job	Job	18	5	25	"You will know also that your descendants will be many, And your offspring as the grass of the earth.
Job	Job	18	5	26	"You will come to the grave in full vigor, Like the stacking of grain in its season.
Job	Job	18	5	27	"Behold this; we have investigated it, and so it is. Hear it, and know for yourself."
Job	Job	18	6	1	Then Job answered,
Job	Job	18	6	2	"Oh that my grief were actually weighed And laid in the balances together with my calamity!
Job	Job	18	6	3	"For then it would be heavier than the sand of the seas; Therefore my words have been rash.
Job	Job	18	6	4	"For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, Their poison my spirit drinks; The terrors of God are arrayed against me.
Job	Job	18	6	5	"Does the wild donkey bray over his grass, Or does the ox low over his fodder?
Job	Job	18	6	6	"Can something tasteless be eaten without salt, Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
Job	Job	18	6	7	"My soul refuses to touch them; They are like loathsome food to me.
Job	Job	18	6	8	"Oh that my request might come to pass, And that God would grant my longing!
Job	Job	18	6	9	"Would that God were willing to crush me, That He would loose His hand and cut me off!
Job	Job	18	6	10	"But it is still my consolation, And I rejoice in unsparing pain, That I have not denied the words of the Holy One.
Job	Job	18	6	11	"What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is my end, that I should endure?
Job	Job	18	6	12	"Is my strength the strength of stones, Or is my flesh bronze?
Job	Job	18	6	13	"Is it that my help is not within me, And that deliverance is driven from me?
Job	Job	18	6	14	"For the despairing man there should be kindness from his friend; So that he does not forsake the fear of the Almighty.
Job	Job	18	6	15	"My brothers have acted deceitfully like a wadi, Like the torrents of wadis which vanish,
Job	Job	18	6	16	Which are turbid because of ice And into which the snow melts.
Job	Job	18	6	17	"When they become waterless, they are silent, When it is hot, they vanish from their place.
Job	Job	18	6	18	"The paths of their course wind along, They go up into nothing and perish.
Job	Job	18	6	19	"The caravans of Tema looked, The travelers of Sheba hoped for them.
Job	Job	18	6	20	"They were disappointed for they had trusted, They came there and were confounded.
Job	Job	18	6	21	"Indeed, you have now become such, You see a terror and are afraid.
Job	Job	18	6	22	"Have I said, 'Give me something,' Or, 'Offer a bribe for me from your wealth,'
Job	Job	18	6	23	Or, 'Deliver me from the hand of the adversary,' Or, 'Redeem me from the hand of the tyrants'?
Job	Job	18	6	24	"Teach me, and I will be silent; And show me how I have erred.
Job	Job	18	6	25	"How painful are honest words! But what does your argument prove?
Job	Job	18	6	26	"Do you intend to reprove my words, When the words of one in despair belong to the wind?
Job	Job	18	6	27	"You would even cast lots for the orphans And barter over your friend.
Job	Job	18	6	28	"Now please look at me, And see if I lie to your face.
Job	Job	18	6	29	"Desist now, let there be no injustice; Even desist, my righteousness is yet in it.
Job	Job	18	6	30	"Is there injustice on my tongue? Cannot my palate discern calamities?
Job	Job	18	7	1	"Is not man forced to labor on earth, And are not his days like the days of a hired man?
Job	Job	18	7	2	"As a slave who pants for the shade, And as a hired man who eagerly waits for his wages,
Job	Job	18	7	3	So am I allotted months of vanity, And nights of trouble are appointed me.
Job	Job	18	7	4	"When I lie down I say, 'When shall I arise?' But the night continues, And I am continually tossing until dawn.
Job	Job	18	7	5	"My flesh is clothed with worms and a crust of dirt, My skin hardens and runs.
Job	Job	18	7	6	"My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, And come to an end without hope.
Job	Job	18	7	7	"Remember that my life is but breath; My eye will not again see good.
Job	Job	18	7	8	"The eye of him who sees me will behold me no longer; Your eyes will be on me, but I will not be.
Job	Job	18	7	9	"When a cloud vanishes, it is gone, So he who goes down to Sheol does not come up.
Job	Job	18	7	10	"He will not return again to his house, Nor will his place know him anymore.
Job	Job	18	7	11	"Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit, I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
Job	Job	18	7	12	"Am I the sea, or the sea monster, That You set a guard over me?
Job	Job	18	7	13	"If I say, 'My bed will comfort me, My couch will ease my complaint,'
Job	Job	18	7	14	Then You frighten me with dreams And terrify me by visions;
Job	Job	18	7	15	So that my soul would choose suffocation, Death rather than my pains.
Job	Job	18	7	16	"I waste away; I will not live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are but a breath.
Job	Job	18	7	17	"What is man that You magnify him, And that You are concerned about him,
Job	Job	18	7	18	That You examine him every morning And try him every moment?
Job	Job	18	7	19	"Will You never turn Your gaze away from me, Nor let me alone until I swallow my spittle?
Job	Job	18	7	20	"Have I sinned? What have I done to You, O watcher of men? Why have You set me as Your target, So that I am a burden to myself?
Job	Job	18	7	21	"Why then do You not pardon my transgression And take away my iniquity? For now I will lie down in the dust; And You will seek me, but I will not be."
Job	Job	18	8	1	Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,
Job	Job	18	8	2	"How long will you say these things, And the words of your mouth be a mighty wind?
Job	Job	18	8	3	"Does God pervert justice? Or does the Almighty pervert what is right?
Job	Job	18	8	4	"If your sons sinned against Him, Then He delivered them into the power of their transgression.
Job	Job	18	8	5	"If you would seek God And implore the compassion of the Almighty,
Job	Job	18	8	6	If you are pure and upright, Surely now He would rouse Himself for you And restore your righteous estate.
Job	Job	18	8	7	"Though your beginning was insignificant, Yet your end will increase greatly.
Job	Job	18	8	8	"Please inquire of past generations, And consider the things searched out by their fathers.
Job	Job	18	8	9	"For we are only of yesterday and know nothing, Because our days on earth are as a shadow.
Job	Job	18	8	10	"Will they not teach you and tell you, And bring forth words from their minds?
Job	Job	18	8	11	"Can the papyrus grow up without a marsh? Can the rushes grow without water?
Job	Job	18	8	12	"While it is still green and not cut down, Yet it withers before any other plant.
Job	Job	18	8	13	"So are the paths of all who forget God; And the hope of the godless will perish,
Job	Job	18	8	14	Whose confidence is fragile, And whose trust a spider's web.
Job	Job	18	8	15	"He trusts in his house, but it does not stand; He holds fast to it, but it does not endure.
Job	Job	18	8	16	"He thrives before the sun, And his shoots spread out over his garden.
Job	Job	18	8	17	"His roots wrap around a rock pile, He grasps a house of stones.
Job	Job	18	8	18	"If he is removed from his place, Then it will deny him, saying, 'I never saw you.'
Job	Job	18	8	19	"Behold, this is the joy of His way; And out of the dust others will spring.
Job	Job	18	8	20	"Lo, God will not reject a man of integrity, Nor will He support the evildoers.
Job	Job	18	8	21	"He will yet fill your mouth with laughter And your lips with shouting.
Job	Job	18	8	22	"Those who hate you will be clothed with shame, And the tent of the wicked will be no longer."
Job	Job	18	9	1	Then Job answered,
Job	Job	18	9	2	"In truth I know that this is so; But how can a man be in the right before God?
Job	Job	18	9	3	"If one wished to dispute with Him, He could not answer Him once in a thousand times.
Job	Job	18	9	4	"Wise in heart and mighty in strength, Who has defied Him without harm?
Job	Job	18	9	5	"It is God who removes the mountains, they know not how, When He overturns them in His anger;
Job	Job	18	9	6	Who shakes the earth out of its place, And its pillars tremble;
Job	Job	18	9	7	Who commands the sun not to shine, And sets a seal upon the stars;
Job	Job	18	9	8	Who alone stretches out the heavens And tramples down the waves of the sea;
Job	Job	18	9	9	Who makes the Bear, Orion and the Pleiades, And the chambers of the south;
Job	Job	18	9	10	Who does great things, unfathomable, And wondrous works without number.
Job	Job	18	9	11	"Were He to pass by me, I would not see Him; Were He to move past me, I would not perceive Him.
Job	Job	18	9	12	"Were He to snatch away, who could restrain Him? Who could say to Him, 'What are You doing?'
Job	Job	18	9	13	"God will not turn back His anger; Beneath Him crouch the helpers of Rahab.
Job	Job	18	9	14	"How then can I answer Him, And choose my words before Him?
Job	Job	18	9	15	"For though I were right, I could not answer; I would have to implore the mercy of my judge.
Job	Job	18	9	16	"If I called and He answered me, I could not believe that He was listening to my voice.
Job	Job	18	9	17	"For He bruises me with a tempest And multiplies my wounds without cause.
Job	Job	18	9	18	"He will not allow me to get my breath, But saturates me with bitterness.
Job	Job	18	9	19	"If it is a matter of power, behold, He is the strong one! And if it is a matter of justice, who can summon Him?
Job	Job	18	9	20	"Though I am righteous, my mouth will condemn me; Though I am guiltless, He will declare me guilty.
Job	Job	18	9	21	"I am guiltless; I do not take notice of myself; I despise my life.
Job	Job	18	9	22	"It is all one; therefore I say, 'He destroys the guiltless and the wicked.'
Job	Job	18	9	23	"If the scourge kills suddenly, He mocks the despair of the innocent.
Job	Job	18	9	24	"The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; He covers the faces of its judges. If it is not He, then who is it?
Job	Job	18	9	25	"Now my days are swifter than a runner; They flee away, they see no good.
Job	Job	18	9	26	"They slip by like reed boats, Like an eagle that swoops on its prey.
Job	Job	18	9	27	"Though I say, 'I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my sad countenance and be cheerful,'
Job	Job	18	9	28	I am afraid of all my pains, I know that You will not acquit me.
Job	Job	18	9	29	"I am accounted wicked, Why then should I toil in vain?
Job	Job	18	9	30	"If I should wash myself with snow And cleanse my hands with lye,
Job	Job	18	9	31	Yet You would plunge me into the pit, And my own clothes would abhor me.
Job	Job	18	9	32	"For He is not a man as I am that I may answer Him, That we may go to court together.
Job	Job	18	9	33	"There is no umpire between us, Who may lay his hand upon us both.
Job	Job	18	9	34	"Let Him remove His rod from me, And let not dread of Him terrify me.
Job	Job	18	9	35	"Then I would speak and not fear Him; But I am not like that in myself.
Job	Job	18	10	1	"I loathe my own life; I will give full vent to my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
Job	Job	18	10	2	"I will say to God, 'Do not condemn me; Let me know why You contend with me.
Job	Job	18	10	3	'Is it right for You indeed to oppress, To reject the labor of Your hands, And to look favorably on the schemes of the wicked?
Job	Job	18	10	4	'Have You eyes of flesh? Or do You see as a man sees?
Job	Job	18	10	5	'Are Your days as the days of a mortal, Or Your years as man's years,
Job	Job	18	10	6	That You should seek for my guilt And search after my sin?
Job	Job	18	10	7	'According to Your knowledge I am indeed not guilty, Yet there is no deliverance from Your hand.
Job	Job	18	10	8	'Your hands fashioned and made me altogether, And would You destroy me?
Job	Job	18	10	9	'Remember now, that You have made me as clay; And would You turn me into dust again?
Job	Job	18	10	10	'Did You not pour me out like milk And curdle me like cheese;
Job	Job	18	10	11	Clothe me with skin and flesh, And knit me together with bones and sinews?
Job	Job	18	10	12	'You have granted me life and lovingkindness; And Your care has preserved my spirit.
Job	Job	18	10	13	'Yet these things You have concealed in Your heart; I know that this is within You:
Job	Job	18	10	14	If I sin, then You would take note of me, And would not acquit me of my guilt.
Job	Job	18	10	15	'If I am wicked, woe to me! And if I am righteous, I dare not lift up my head. I am sated with disgrace and conscious of my misery.
Job	Job	18	10	16	'Should my head be lifted up, You would hunt me like a lion; And again You would show Your power against me.
Job	Job	18	10	17	'You renew Your witnesses against me And increase Your anger toward me; Hardship after hardship is with me.
Job	Job	18	10	18	'Why then have You brought me out of the womb? Would that I had died and no eye had seen me!
Job	Job	18	10	19	'I should have been as though I had not been, Carried from womb to tomb.'
Job	Job	18	10	20	"Would He not let my few days alone? Withdraw from me that I may have a little cheer
Job	Job	18	10	21	Before I go--and I shall not return-- To the land of darkness and deep shadow,
Job	Job	18	10	22	The land of utter gloom as darkness itself, Of deep shadow without order, And which shines as the darkness."
Job	Job	18	11	1	Then Zophar the Naamathite answered,
Job	Job	18	11	2	"Shall a multitude of words go unanswered, And a talkative man be acquitted?
Job	Job	18	11	3	"Shall your boasts silence men? And shall you scoff and none rebuke?
Job	Job	18	11	4	"For you have said, 'My teaching is pure, And I am innocent in your eyes.'
Job	Job	18	11	5	"But would that God might speak, And open His lips against you,
Job	Job	18	11	6	And show you the secrets of wisdom! For sound wisdom has two sides. Know then that God forgets a part of your iniquity.
Job	Job	18	11	7	"Can you discover the depths of God? Can you discover the limits of the Almighty?
Job	Job	18	11	8	"They are high as the heavens, what can you do? Deeper than Sheol, what can you know?
Job	Job	18	11	9	"Its measure is longer than the earth And broader than the sea.
Job	Job	18	11	10	"If He passes by or shuts up, Or calls an assembly, who can restrain Him?
Job	Job	18	11	11	"For He knows false men, And He sees iniquity without investigating.
Job	Job	18	11	12	"An idiot will become intelligent When the foal of a wild donkey is born a man.
Job	Job	18	11	13	"If you would direct your heart right And spread out your hand to Him,
Job	Job	18	11	14	If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away, And do not let wickedness dwell in your tents;
Job	Job	18	11	15	"Then, indeed, you could lift up your face without moral defect, And you would be steadfast and not fear.
Job	Job	18	11	16	"For you would forget your trouble, As waters that have passed by, you would remember it.
Job	Job	18	11	17	"Your life would be brighter than noonday; Darkness would be like the morning.
Job	Job	18	11	18	"Then you would trust, because there is hope; And you would look around and rest securely.
Job	Job	18	11	19	"You would lie down and none would disturb you, And many would entreat your favor.
Job	Job	18	11	20	"But the eyes of the wicked will fail, And there will be no escape for them; And their hope is to breathe their last."
Job	Job	18	12	1	Then Job responded,
Job	Job	18	12	2	"Truly then you are the people, And with you wisdom will die!
Job	Job	18	12	3	"But I have intelligence as well as you; I am not inferior to you. And who does not know such things as these?
Job	Job	18	12	4	"I am a joke to my friends, The one who called on God and He answered him; The just and blameless man is a joke.
Job	Job	18	12	5	"He who is at ease holds calamity in contempt, As prepared for those whose feet slip.
Job	Job	18	12	6	"The tents of the destroyers prosper, And those who provoke God are secure, Whom God brings into their power.
Job	Job	18	12	7	"But now ask the beasts, and let them teach you; And the birds of the heavens, and let them tell you.
Job	Job	18	12	8	"Or speak to the earth, and let it teach you; And let the fish of the sea declare to you.
Job	Job	18	12	9	"Who among all these does not know That the hand of the LORD has done this,
Job	Job	18	12	10	In whose hand is the life of every living thing, And the breath of all mankind?
Job	Job	18	12	11	"Does not the ear test words, As the palate tastes its food?
Job	Job	18	12	12	"Wisdom is with aged men, With long life is understanding.
Job	Job	18	12	13	"With Him are wisdom and might; To Him belong counsel and understanding.
Job	Job	18	12	14	"Behold, He tears down, and it cannot be rebuilt; He imprisons a man, and there can be no release.
Job	Job	18	12	15	"Behold, He restrains the waters, and they dry up; And He sends them out, and they inundate the earth.
Job	Job	18	12	16	"With Him are strength and sound wisdom, The misled and the misleader belong to Him.
Job	Job	18	12	17	"He makes counselors walk barefoot And makes fools of judges.
Job	Job	18	12	18	"He loosens the bond of kings And binds their loins with a girdle.
Job	Job	18	12	19	"He makes priests walk barefoot And overthrows the secure ones.
Job	Job	18	12	20	"He deprives the trusted ones of speech And takes away the discernment of the elders.
Job	Job	18	12	21	"He pours contempt on nobles And loosens the belt of the strong.
Job	Job	18	12	22	"He reveals mysteries from the darkness And brings the deep darkness into light.
Job	Job	18	12	23	"He makes the nations great, then destroys them; He enlarges the nations, then leads them away.
Job	Job	18	12	24	"He deprives of intelligence the chiefs of the earth's people And makes them wander in a pathless waste.
Job	Job	18	12	25	"They grope in darkness with no light, And He makes them stagger like a drunken man.
Job	Job	18	13	1	"Behold, my eye has seen all this, My ear has heard and understood it.
Job	Job	18	13	2	"What you know I also know; I am not inferior to you.
Job	Job	18	13	3	"But I would speak to the Almighty, And I desire to argue with God.
Job	Job	18	13	4	"But you smear with lies; You are all worthless physicians.
Job	Job	18	13	5	"O that you would be completely silent, And that it would become your wisdom!
Job	Job	18	13	6	"Please hear my argument And listen to the contentions of my lips.
Job	Job	18	13	7	"Will you speak what is unjust for God, And speak what is deceitful for Him?
Job	Job	18	13	8	"Will you show partiality for Him? Will you contend for God?
Job	Job	18	13	9	"Will it be well when He examines you? Or will you deceive Him as one deceives a man?
Job	Job	18	13	10	"He will surely reprove you If you secretly show partiality.
Job	Job	18	13	11	"Will not His majesty terrify you, And the dread of Him fall on you?
Job	Job	18	13	12	"Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes, Your defenses are defenses of clay.
Job	Job	18	13	13	"Be silent before me so that I may speak; Then let come on me what may.
Job	Job	18	13	14	"Why should I take my flesh in my teeth And put my life in my hands?
Job	Job	18	13	15	"Though He slay me, I will hope in Him. Nevertheless I will argue my ways before Him.
Job	Job	18	13	16	"This also will be my salvation, For a godless man may not come before His presence.
Job	Job	18	13	17	"Listen carefully to my speech, And let my declaration fill your ears.
Job	Job	18	13	18	"Behold now, I have prepared my case; I know that I will be vindicated.
Job	Job	18	13	19	"Who will contend with me? For then I would be silent and die.
Job	Job	18	13	20	"Only two things do not do to me, Then I will not hide from Your face:
Job	Job	18	13	21	Remove Your hand from me, And let not the dread of You terrify me.
Job	Job	18	13	22	"Then call, and I will answer; Or let me speak, then reply to me.
Job	Job	18	13	23	"How many are my iniquities and sins? Make known to me my rebellion and my sin.
Job	Job	18	13	24	"Why do You hide Your face And consider me Your enemy?
Job	Job	18	13	25	"Will You cause a driven leaf to tremble? Or will You pursue the dry chaff?
Job	Job	18	13	26	"For You write bitter things against me And make me to inherit the iniquities of my youth.
Job	Job	18	13	27	"You put my feet in the stocks And watch all my paths; You set a limit for the soles of my feet,
Job	Job	18	13	28	While I am decaying like a rotten thing, Like a garment that is moth-eaten.
Job	Job	18	14	1	"Man, who is born of woman, Is short-lived and full of turmoil.
Job	Job	18	14	2	"Like a flower he comes forth and withers. He also flees like a shadow and does not remain.
Job	Job	18	14	3	"You also open Your eyes on him And bring him into judgment with Yourself.
Job	Job	18	14	4	"Who can make the clean out of the unclean? No one!
Job	Job	18	14	5	"Since his days are determined, The number of his months is with You; And his limits You have set so that he cannot pass.
Job	Job	18	14	6	"Turn Your gaze from him that he may rest, Until he fulfills his day like a hired man.
Job	Job	18	14	7	"For there is hope for a tree, When it is cut down, that it will sprout again, And its shoots will not fail.
Job	Job	18	14	8	"Though its roots grow old in the ground And its stump dies in the dry soil,
Job	Job	18	14	9	At the scent of water it will flourish And put forth sprigs like a plant.
Job	Job	18	14	10	"But man dies and lies prostrate. Man expires, and where is he?
Job	Job	18	14	11	"As water evaporates from the sea, And a river becomes parched and dried up,
Job	Job	18	14	12	So man lies down and does not rise. Until the heavens are no longer, He will not awake nor be aroused out of his sleep.
Job	Job	18	14	13	"Oh that You would hide me in Sheol, That You would conceal me until Your wrath returns to You, That You would set a limit for me and remember me!
Job	Job	18	14	14	"If a man dies, will he live again? All the days of my struggle I will wait Until my change comes.
Job	Job	18	14	15	"You will call, and I will answer You; You will long for the work of Your hands.
Job	Job	18	14	16	"For now You number my steps, You do not observe my sin.
Job	Job	18	14	17	"My transgression is sealed up in a bag, And You wrap up my iniquity.
Job	Job	18	14	18	"But the falling mountain crumbles away, And the rock moves from its place;
Job	Job	18	14	19	Water wears away stones, Its torrents wash away the dust of the earth; So You destroy man's hope.
Job	Job	18	14	20	"You forever overpower him and he departs; You change his appearance and send him away.
Job	Job	18	14	21	"His sons achieve honor, but he does not know it; Or they become insignificant, but he does not perceive it.
Job	Job	18	14	22	"But his body pains him, And he mourns only for himself."
Job	Job	18	15	1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite responded,
Job	Job	18	15	2	"Should a wise man answer with windy knowledge And fill himself with the east wind?
Job	Job	18	15	3	"Should he argue with useless talk, Or with words which are not profitable?
Job	Job	18	15	4	"Indeed, you do away with reverence And hinder meditation before God.
Job	Job	18	15	5	"For your guilt teaches your mouth, And you choose the language of the crafty.
Job	Job	18	15	6	"Your own mouth condemns you, and not I; And your own lips testify against you.
Job	Job	18	15	7	"Were you the first man to be born, Or were you brought forth before the hills?
Job	Job	18	15	8	"Do you hear the secret counsel of God, And limit wisdom to yourself?
Job	Job	18	15	9	"What do you know that we do not know? What do you understand that we do not?
Job	Job	18	15	10	"Both the gray-haired and the aged are among us, Older than your father.
Job	Job	18	15	11	"Are the consolations of God too small for you, Even the word spoken gently with you?
Job	Job	18	15	12	"Why does your heart carry you away? And why do your eyes flash,
Job	Job	18	15	13	That you should turn your spirit against God And allow such words to go out of your mouth?
Job	Job	18	15	14	"What is man, that he should be pure, Or he who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?
Job	Job	18	15	15	"Behold, He puts no trust in His holy ones, And the heavens are not pure in His sight;
Job	Job	18	15	16	How much less one who is detestable and corrupt, Man, who drinks iniquity like water!
Job	Job	18	15	17	"I will tell you, listen to me; And what I have seen I will also declare;
Job	Job	18	15	18	What wise men have told, And have not concealed from their fathers,
Job	Job	18	15	19	To whom alone the land was given, And no alien passed among them.
Job	Job	18	15	20	"The wicked man writhes in pain all his days, And numbered are the years stored up for the ruthless.
Job	Job	18	15	21	"Sounds of terror are in his ears; While at peace the destroyer comes upon him.
Job	Job	18	15	22	"He does not believe that he will return from darkness, And he is destined for the sword.
Job	Job	18	15	23	"He wanders about for food, saying, 'Where is it?' He knows that a day of darkness is at hand.
Job	Job	18	15	24	"Distress and anguish terrify him, They overpower him like a king ready for the attack,
Job	Job	18	15	25	Because he has stretched out his hand against God And conducts himself arrogantly against the Almighty.
Job	Job	18	15	26	"He rushes headlong at Him With his massive shield.
Job	Job	18	15	27	"For he has covered his face with his fat And made his thighs heavy with flesh.
Job	Job	18	15	28	"He has lived in desolate cities, In houses no one would inhabit, Which are destined to become ruins.
Job	Job	18	15	29	"He will not become rich, nor will his wealth endure; And his grain will not bend down to the ground.
Job	Job	18	15	30	"He will not escape from darkness; The flame will wither his shoots, And by the breath of His mouth he will go away.
Job	Job	18	15	31	"Let him not trust in emptiness, deceiving himself; For emptiness will be his reward.
Job	Job	18	15	32	"It will be accomplished before his time, And his palm branch will not be green.
Job	Job	18	15	33	"He will drop off his unripe grape like the vine, And will cast off his flower like the olive tree.
Job	Job	18	15	34	"For the company of the godless is barren, And fire consumes the tents of the corrupt.
Job	Job	18	15	35	"They conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity, And their mind prepares deception."
Job	Job	18	16	1	Then Job answered,
Job	Job	18	16	2	"I have heard many such things; Sorry comforters are you all.
Job	Job	18	16	3	"Is there no limit to windy words? Or what plagues you that you answer?
Job	Job	18	16	4	"I too could speak like you, If I were in your place. I could compose words against you And shake my head at you.
Job	Job	18	16	5	"I could strengthen you with my mouth, And the solace of my lips could lessen your pain.
Job	Job	18	16	6	"If I speak, my pain is not lessened, And if I hold back, what has left me?
Job	Job	18	16	7	"But now He has exhausted me; You have laid waste all my company.
Job	Job	18	16	8	"You have shriveled me up, It has become a witness; And my leanness rises up against me, It testifies to my face.
Job	Job	18	16	9	"His anger has torn me and hunted me down, He has gnashed at me with His teeth; My adversary glares at me.
Job	Job	18	16	10	"They have gaped at me with their mouth, They have slapped me on the cheek with contempt; They have massed themselves against me.
Job	Job	18	16	11	"God hands me over to ruffians And tosses me into the hands of the wicked.
Job	Job	18	16	12	"I was at ease, but He shattered me, And He has grasped me by the neck and shaken me to pieces; He has also set me up as His target.
Job	Job	18	16	13	"His arrows surround me. Without mercy He splits my kidneys open; He pours out my gall on the ground.
Job	Job	18	16	14	"He breaks through me with breach after breach; He runs at me like a warrior.
Job	Job	18	16	15	"I have sewed sackcloth over my skin And thrust my horn in the dust.
Job	Job	18	16	16	"My face is flushed from weeping, And deep darkness is on my eyelids,
Job	Job	18	16	17	Although there is no violence in my hands, And my prayer is pure.
Job	Job	18	16	18	"O earth, do not cover my blood, And let there be no resting place for my cry.
Job	Job	18	16	19	"Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven, And my advocate is on high.
Job	Job	18	16	20	"My friends are my scoffers; My eye weeps to God.
Job	Job	18	16	21	"O that a man might plead with God As a man with his neighbor!
Job	Job	18	16	22	"For when a few years are past, I shall go the way of no return.
Job	Job	18	17	1	"My spirit is broken, my days are extinguished, The grave is ready for me.
Job	Job	18	17	2	"Surely mockers are with me, And my eye gazes on their provocation.
Job	Job	18	17	3	"Lay down, now, a pledge for me with Yourself; Who is there that will be my guarantor?
Job	Job	18	17	4	"For You have kept their heart from understanding, Therefore You will not exalt them.
Job	Job	18	17	5	"He who informs against friends for a share of the spoil, The eyes of his children also will languish.
Job	Job	18	17	6	"But He has made me a byword of the people, And I am one at whom men spit.
Job	Job	18	17	7	"My eye has also grown dim because of grief, And all my members are as a shadow.
Job	Job	18	17	8	"The upright will be appalled at this, And the innocent will stir up himself against the godless.
Job	Job	18	17	9	"Nevertheless the righteous will hold to his way, And he who has clean hands will grow stronger and stronger.
Job	Job	18	17	10	"But come again all of you now, For I do not find a wise man among you.
Job	Job	18	17	11	"My days are past, my plans are torn apart, Even the wishes of my heart.
Job	Job	18	17	12	"They make night into day, saying, 'The light is near,' in the presence of darkness.
Job	Job	18	17	13	"If I look for Sheol as my home, I make my bed in the darkness;
Job	Job	18	17	14	If I call to the pit, 'You are my father'; To the worm, 'my mother and my sister';
Job	Job	18	17	15	Where now is my hope? And who regards my hope?
Job	Job	18	17	16	"Will it go down with me to Sheol? Shall we together go down into the dust?"
Job	Job	18	18	1	Then Bildad the Shuhite responded,
Job	Job	18	18	2	"How long will you hunt for words? Show understanding and then we can talk.
Job	Job	18	18	3	"Why are we regarded as beasts, As stupid in your eyes?
Job	Job	18	18	4	"O you who tear yourself in your anger-- For your sake is the earth to be abandoned, Or the rock to be moved from its place?
Job	Job	18	18	5	"Indeed, the light of the wicked goes out, And the flame of his fire gives no light.
Job	Job	18	18	6	"The light in his tent is darkened, And his lamp goes out above him.
Job	Job	18	18	7	"His vigorous stride is shortened, And his own scheme brings him down.
Job	Job	18	18	8	"For he is thrown into the net by his own feet, And he steps on the webbing.
Job	Job	18	18	9	"A snare seizes him by the heel, And a trap snaps shut on him.
Job	Job	18	18	10	"A noose for him is hidden in the ground, And a trap for him on the path.
Job	Job	18	18	11	"All around terrors frighten him, And harry him at every step.
Job	Job	18	18	12	"His strength is famished, And calamity is ready at his side.
Job	Job	18	18	13	"His skin is devoured by disease, The firstborn of death devours his limbs.
Job	Job	18	18	14	"He is torn from the security of his tent, And they march him before the king of terrors.
Job	Job	18	18	15	"There dwells in his tent nothing of his; Brimstone is scattered on his habitation.
Job	Job	18	18	16	"His roots are dried below, And his branch is cut off above.
Job	Job	18	18	17	"Memory of him perishes from the earth, And he has no name abroad.
Job	Job	18	18	18	"He is driven from light into darkness, And chased from the inhabited world.
Job	Job	18	18	19	"He has no offspring or posterity among his people, Nor any survivor where he sojourned.
Job	Job	18	18	20	"Those in the west are appalled at his fate, And those in the east are seized with horror.
Job	Job	18	18	21	"Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, And this is the place of him who does not know God."
Job	Job	18	19	1	Then Job responded,
Job	Job	18	19	2	"How long will you torment me And crush me with words?
Job	Job	18	19	3	"These ten times you have insulted me; You are not ashamed to wrong me.
Job	Job	18	19	4	"Even if I have truly erred, My error lodges with me.
Job	Job	18	19	5	"If indeed you vaunt yourselves against me And prove my disgrace to me,
Job	Job	18	19	6	Know then that God has wronged me And has closed His net around me.
Job	Job	18	19	7	"Behold, I cry, 'Violence!' but I get no answer; I shout for help, but there is no justice.
Job	Job	18	19	8	"He has walled up my way so that I cannot pass, And He has put darkness on my paths.
Job	Job	18	19	9	"He has stripped my honor from me And removed the crown from my head.
Job	Job	18	19	10	"He breaks me down on every side, and I am gone; And He has uprooted my hope like a tree.
Job	Job	18	19	11	"He has also kindled His anger against me And considered me as His enemy.
Job	Job	18	19	12	"His troops come together, And build up their way against me And camp around my tent.
Job	Job	18	19	13	"He has removed my brothers far from me, And my acquaintances are completely estranged from me.
Job	Job	18	19	14	"My relatives have failed, And my intimate friends have forgotten me.
Job	Job	18	19	15	"Those who live in my house and my maids consider me a stranger. I am a foreigner in their sight.
Job	Job	18	19	16	"I call to my servant, but he does not answer; I have to implore him with my mouth.
Job	Job	18	19	17	"My breath is offensive to my wife, And I am loathsome to my own brothers.
Job	Job	18	19	18	"Even young children despise me; I rise up and they speak against me.
Job	Job	18	19	19	"All my associates abhor me, And those I love have turned against me.
Job	Job	18	19	20	"My bone clings to my skin and my flesh, And I have escaped only by the skin of my teeth.
Job	Job	18	19	21	"Pity me, pity me, O you my friends, For the hand of God has struck me.
Job	Job	18	19	22	"Why do you persecute me as God does, And are not satisfied with my flesh?
Job	Job	18	19	23	"Oh that my words were written! Oh that they were inscribed in a book!
Job	Job	18	19	24	"That with an iron stylus and lead They were engraved in the rock forever!
Job	Job	18	19	25	"As for me, I know that my Redeemer lives, And at the last He will take His stand on the earth.
Job	Job	18	19	26	"Even after my skin is destroyed, Yet from my flesh I shall see God;
Job	Job	18	19	27	Whom I myself shall behold, And whom my eyes will see and not another. My heart faints within me!
Job	Job	18	19	28	"If you say, 'How shall we persecute him?' And 'What pretext for a case against him can we find?'
Job	Job	18	19	29	"Then be afraid of the sword for yourselves, For wrath brings the punishment of the sword, So that you may know there is judgment."
Job	Job	18	20	1	Then Zophar the Naamathite answered,
Job	Job	18	20	2	"Therefore my disquieting thoughts make me respond, Even because of my inward agitation.
Job	Job	18	20	3	"I listened to the reproof which insults me, And the spirit of my understanding makes me answer.
Job	Job	18	20	4	"Do you know this from of old, From the establishment of man on earth,
Job	Job	18	20	5	That the triumphing of the wicked is short, And the joy of the godless momentary?
Job	Job	18	20	6	"Though his loftiness reaches the heavens, And his head touches the clouds,
Job	Job	18	20	7	He perishes forever like his refuse; Those who have seen him will say, 'Where is he?'
Job	Job	18	20	8	"He flies away like a dream, and they cannot find him; Even like a vision of the night he is chased away.
Job	Job	18	20	9	"The eye which saw him sees him no longer, And his place no longer beholds him.
Job	Job	18	20	10	"His sons favor the poor, And his hands give back his wealth.
Job	Job	18	20	11	"His bones are full of his youthful vigor, But it lies down with him in the dust.
Job	Job	18	20	12	"Though evil is sweet in his mouth And he hides it under his tongue,
Job	Job	18	20	13	Though he desires it and will not let it go, But holds it in his mouth,
Job	Job	18	20	14	Yet his food in his stomach is changed To the venom of cobras within him.
Job	Job	18	20	15	"He swallows riches, But will vomit them up; God will expel them from his belly.
Job	Job	18	20	16	"He sucks the poison of cobras; The viper's tongue slays him.
Job	Job	18	20	17	"He does not look at the streams, The rivers flowing with honey and curds.
Job	Job	18	20	18	"He returns what he has attained And cannot swallow it; As to the riches of his trading, He cannot even enjoy them.
Job	Job	18	20	19	"For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor; He has seized a house which he has not built.
Job	Job	18	20	20	"Because he knew no quiet within him, He does not retain anything he desires.
Job	Job	18	20	21	"Nothing remains for him to devour, Therefore his prosperity does not endure.
Job	Job	18	20	22	"In the fullness of his plenty he will be cramped; The hand of everyone who suffers will come against him.
Job	Job	18	20	23	"When he fills his belly, God will send His fierce anger on him And will rain it on him while he is eating.
Job	Job	18	20	24	"He may flee from the iron weapon, But the bronze bow will pierce him.
Job	Job	18	20	25	"It is drawn forth and comes out of his back, Even the glittering point from his gall. Terrors come upon him,
Job	Job	18	20	26	Complete darkness is held in reserve for his treasures, And unfanned fire will devour him; It will consume the survivor in his tent.
Job	Job	18	20	27	"The heavens will reveal his iniquity, And the earth will rise up against him.
Job	Job	18	20	28	"The increase of his house will depart; His possessions will flow away in the day of His anger.
Job	Job	18	20	29	"This is the wicked man's portion from God, Even the heritage decreed to him by God."
Job	Job	18	21	1	Then Job answered,
Job	Job	18	21	2	"Listen carefully to my speech, And let this be your way of consolation.
Job	Job	18	21	3	"Bear with me that I may speak; Then after I have spoken, you may mock.
Job	Job	18	21	4	"As for me, is my complaint to man? And why should I not be impatient?
Job	Job	18	21	5	"Look at me, and be astonished, And put your hand over your mouth.
Job	Job	18	21	6	"Even when I remember, I am disturbed, And horror takes hold of my flesh.
Job	Job	18	21	7	"Why do the wicked still live, Continue on, also become very powerful?
Job	Job	18	21	8	"Their descendants are established with them in their sight, And their offspring before their eyes,
Job	Job	18	21	9	Their houses are safe from fear, And the rod of God is not on them.
Job	Job	18	21	10	"His ox mates without fail; His cow calves and does not abort.
Job	Job	18	21	11	"They send forth their little ones like the flock, And their children skip about.
Job	Job	18	21	12	"They sing to the timbrel and harp And rejoice at the sound of the flute.
Job	Job	18	21	13	"They spend their days in prosperity, And suddenly they go down to Sheol.
Job	Job	18	21	14	"They say to God, 'Depart from us! We do not even desire the knowledge of Your ways.
Job	Job	18	21	15	'Who is the Almighty, that we should serve Him, And what would we gain if we entreat Him?'
Job	Job	18	21	16	"Behold, their prosperity is not in their hand; The counsel of the wicked is far from me.
Job	Job	18	21	17	"How often is the lamp of the wicked put out, Or does their calamity fall on them? Does God apportion destruction in His anger?
Job	Job	18	21	18	"Are they as straw before the wind, And like chaff which the storm carries away?
Job	Job	18	21	19	"You say, 'God stores away a man's iniquity for his sons.' Let God repay him so that he may know it.
Job	Job	18	21	20	"Let his own eyes see his decay, And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
Job	Job	18	21	21	"For what does he care for his household after him, When the number of his months is cut off?
Job	Job	18	21	22	"Can anyone teach God knowledge, In that He judges those on high?
Job	Job	18	21	23	"One dies in his full strength, Being wholly at ease and satisfied;
Job	Job	18	21	24	His sides are filled out with fat, And the marrow of his bones is moist,
Job	Job	18	21	25	While another dies with a bitter soul, Never even tasting anything good.
Job	Job	18	21	26	"Together they lie down in the dust, And worms cover them.
Job	Job	18	21	27	"Behold, I know your thoughts, And the plans by which you would wrong me.
Job	Job	18	21	28	"For you say, 'Where is the house of the nobleman, And where is the tent, the dwelling places of the wicked?'
Job	Job	18	21	29	"Have you not asked wayfaring men, And do you not recognize their witness?
Job	Job	18	21	30	"For the wicked is reserved for the day of calamity; They will be led forth at the day of fury.
Job	Job	18	21	31	"Who will confront him with his actions, And who will repay him for what he has done?
Job	Job	18	21	32	"While he is carried to the grave, Men will keep watch over his tomb.
Job	Job	18	21	33	"The clods of the valley will gently cover him; Moreover, all men will follow after him, While countless ones go before him.
Job	Job	18	21	34	"How then will you vainly comfort me, For your answers remain full of falsehood?"
Job	Job	18	22	1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite responded,
Job	Job	18	22	2	"Can a vigorous man be of use to God, Or a wise man be useful to himself?
Job	Job	18	22	3	"Is there any pleasure to the Almighty if you are righteous, Or profit if you make your ways perfect?
Job	Job	18	22	4	"Is it because of your reverence that He reproves you, That He enters into judgment against you?
Job	Job	18	22	5	"Is not your wickedness great, And your iniquities without end?
Job	Job	18	22	6	"For you have taken pledges of your brothers without cause, And stripped men naked.
Job	Job	18	22	7	"To the weary you have given no water to drink, And from the hungry you have withheld bread.
Job	Job	18	22	8	"But the earth belongs to the mighty man, And the honorable man dwells in it.
Job	Job	18	22	9	"You have sent widows away empty, And the strength of the orphans has been crushed.
Job	Job	18	22	10	"Therefore snares surround you, And sudden dread terrifies you,
Job	Job	18	22	11	Or darkness, so that you cannot see, And an abundance of water covers you.
Job	Job	18	22	12	"Is not God in the height of heaven? Look also at the distant stars, how high they are!
Job	Job	18	22	13	"You say, 'What does God know? Can He judge through the thick darkness?
Job	Job	18	22	14	'Clouds are a hiding place for Him, so that He cannot see; And He walks on the vault of heaven.'
Job	Job	18	22	15	"Will you keep to the ancient path Which wicked men have trod,
Job	Job	18	22	16	Who were snatched away before their time, Whose foundations were washed away by a river?
Job	Job	18	22	17	"They said to God, 'Depart from us!' And 'What can the Almighty do to them?'
Job	Job	18	22	18	"Yet He filled their houses with good things; But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
Job	Job	18	22	19	"The righteous see and are glad, And the innocent mock them,
Job	Job	18	22	20	Saying, 'Truly our adversaries are cut off, And their abundance the fire has consumed.'
Job	Job	18	22	21	"Yield now and be at peace with Him; Thereby good will come to you.
Job	Job	18	22	22	"Please receive instruction from His mouth And establish His words in your heart.
Job	Job	18	22	23	"If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored; If you remove unrighteousness far from your tent,
Job	Job	18	22	24	And place your gold in the dust, And the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks,
Job	Job	18	22	25	Then the Almighty will be your gold And choice silver to you.
Job	Job	18	22	26	"For then you will delight in the Almighty And lift up your face to God.
Job	Job	18	22	27	"You will pray to Him, and He will hear you; And you will pay your vows.
Job	Job	18	22	28	"You will also decree a thing, and it will be established for you; And light will shine on your ways.
Job	Job	18	22	29	"When you are cast down, you will speak with confidence, And the humble person He will save.
Job	Job	18	22	30	"He will deliver one who is not innocent, And he will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands."
Job	Job	18	23	1	Then Job replied,
Job	Job	18	23	2	"Even today my complaint is rebellion; His hand is heavy despite my groaning.
Job	Job	18	23	3	"Oh that I knew where I might find Him, That I might come to His seat!
Job	Job	18	23	4	"I would present my case before Him And fill my mouth with arguments.
Job	Job	18	23	5	"I would learn the words which He would answer, And perceive what He would say to me.
Job	Job	18	23	6	"Would He contend with me by the greatness of His power? No, surely He would pay attention to me.
Job	Job	18	23	7	"There the upright would reason with Him; And I would be delivered forever from my Judge.
Job	Job	18	23	8	"Behold, I go forward but He is not there, And backward, but I cannot perceive Him;
Job	Job	18	23	9	When He acts on the left, I cannot behold Him; He turns on the right, I cannot see Him.
Job	Job	18	23	10	"But He knows the way I take; When He has tried me, I shall come forth as gold.
Job	Job	18	23	11	"My foot has held fast to His path; I have kept His way and not turned aside.
Job	Job	18	23	12	"I have not departed from the command of His lips; I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my necessary food.
Job	Job	18	23	13	"But He is unique and who can turn Him? And what His soul desires, that He does.
Job	Job	18	23	14	"For He performs what is appointed for me, And many such decrees are with Him.
Job	Job	18	23	15	"Therefore, I would be dismayed at His presence; When I consider, I am terrified of Him.
Job	Job	18	23	16	"It is God who has made my heart faint, And the Almighty who has dismayed me,
Job	Job	18	23	17	But I am not silenced by the darkness, Nor deep gloom which covers me.
Job	Job	18	24	1	"Why are times not stored up by the Almighty, And why do those who know Him not see His days?
Job	Job	18	24	2	"Some remove the landmarks; They seize and devour flocks.
Job	Job	18	24	3	"They drive away the donkeys of the orphans; They take the widow's ox for a pledge.
Job	Job	18	24	4	"They push the needy aside from the road; The poor of the land are made to hide themselves altogether.
Job	Job	18	24	5	"Behold, as wild donkeys in the wilderness They go forth seeking food in their activity, As bread for their children in the desert.
Job	Job	18	24	6	"They harvest their fodder in the field And glean the vineyard of the wicked.
Job	Job	18	24	7	"They spend the night naked, without clothing, And have no covering against the cold.
Job	Job	18	24	8	"They are wet with the mountain rains And hug the rock for want of a shelter.
Job	Job	18	24	9	"Others snatch the orphan from the breast, And against the poor they take a pledge.
Job	Job	18	24	10	"They cause the poor to go about naked without clothing, And they take away the sheaves from the hungry.
Job	Job	18	24	11	"Within the walls they produce oil; They tread wine presses but thirst.
Job	Job	18	24	12	"From the city men groan, And the souls of the wounded cry out; Yet God does not pay attention to folly.
Job	Job	18	24	13	"Others have been with those who rebel against the light; They do not want to know its ways Nor abide in its paths.
Job	Job	18	24	14	"The murderer arises at dawn; He kills the poor and the needy, And at night he is as a thief.
Job	Job	18	24	15	"The eye of the adulterer waits for the twilight, Saying, 'No eye will see me.' And he disguises his face.
Job	Job	18	24	16	"In the dark they dig into houses, They shut themselves up by day; They do not know the light.
Job	Job	18	24	17	"For the morning is the same to him as thick darkness, For he is familiar with the terrors of thick darkness.
Job	Job	18	24	18	"They are insignificant on the surface of the water; Their portion is cursed on the earth. They do not turn toward the vineyards.
Job	Job	18	24	19	"Drought and heat consume the snow waters, So does Sheol those who have sinned.
Job	Job	18	24	20	"A mother will forget him; The worm feeds sweetly till he is no longer remembered. And wickedness will be broken like a tree.
Job	Job	18	24	21	"He wrongs the barren woman And does no good for the widow.
Job	Job	18	24	22	"But He drags off the valiant by His power; He rises, but no one has assurance of life.
Job	Job	18	24	23	"He provides them with security, and they are supported; And His eyes are on their ways.
Job	Job	18	24	24	"They are exalted a little while, then they are gone; Moreover, they are brought low and like everything gathered up; Even like the heads of grain they are cut off.
Job	Job	18	24	25	"Now if it is not so, who can prove me a liar, And make my speech worthless?"
Job	Job	18	25	1	Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,
Job	Job	18	25	2	"Dominion and awe belong to Him Who establishes peace in His heights.
Job	Job	18	25	3	"Is there any number to His troops? And upon whom does His light not rise?
Job	Job	18	25	4	"How then can a man be just with God? Or how can he be clean who is born of woman?
Job	Job	18	25	5	"If even the moon has no brightness And the stars are not pure in His sight,
Job	Job	18	25	6	How much less man, that maggot, And the son of man, that worm!"
Job	Job	18	26	1	Then Job responded,
Job	Job	18	26	2	"What a help you are to the weak! How you have saved the arm without strength!
Job	Job	18	26	3	"What counsel you have given to one without wisdom! What helpful insight you have abundantly provided!
Job	Job	18	26	4	"To whom have you uttered words? And whose spirit was expressed through you?
Job	Job	18	26	5	"The departed spirits tremble Under the waters and their inhabitants.
Job	Job	18	26	6	"Naked is Sheol before Him, And Abaddon has no covering.
Job	Job	18	26	7	"He stretches out the north over empty space And hangs the earth on nothing.
Job	Job	18	26	8	"He wraps up the waters in His clouds, And the cloud does not burst under them.
Job	Job	18	26	9	"He obscures the face of the full moon And spreads His cloud over it.
Job	Job	18	26	10	"He has inscribed a circle on the surface of the waters At the boundary of light and darkness.
Job	Job	18	26	11	"The pillars of heaven tremble And are amazed at His rebuke.
Job	Job	18	26	12	"He quieted the sea with His power, And by His understanding He shattered Rahab.
Job	Job	18	26	13	"By His breath the heavens are cleared; His hand has pierced the fleeing serpent.
Job	Job	18	26	14	"Behold, these are the fringes of His ways; And how faint a word we hear of Him! But His mighty thunder, who can understand?"
Job	Job	18	27	1	Then Job continued his discourse and said,
Job	Job	18	27	2	"As God lives, who has taken away my right, And the Almighty, who has embittered my soul,
Job	Job	18	27	3	For as long as life is in me, And the breath of God is in my nostrils,
Job	Job	18	27	4	My lips certainly will not speak unjustly, Nor will my tongue mutter deceit.
Job	Job	18	27	5	"Far be it from me that I should declare you right; Till I die I will not put away my integrity from me.
Job	Job	18	27	6	"I hold fast my righteousness and will not let it go. My heart does not reproach any of my days.
Job	Job	18	27	7	"May my enemy be as the wicked And my opponent as the unjust.
Job	Job	18	27	8	"For what is the hope of the godless when he is cut off, When God requires his life?
Job	Job	18	27	9	"Will God hear his cry When distress comes upon him?
Job	Job	18	27	10	"Will he take delight in the Almighty? Will he call on God at all times?
Job	Job	18	27	11	"I will instruct you in the power of God; What is with the Almighty I will not conceal.
Job	Job	18	27	12	"Behold, all of you have seen it; Why then do you act foolishly?
Job	Job	18	27	13	"This is the portion of a wicked man from God, And the inheritance which tyrants receive from the Almighty.
Job	Job	18	27	14	"Though his sons are many, they are destined for the sword; And his descendants will not be satisfied with bread.
Job	Job	18	27	15	"His survivors will be buried because of the plague, And their widows will not be able to weep.
Job	Job	18	27	16	"Though he piles up silver like dust And prepares garments as plentiful as the clay,
Job	Job	18	27	17	He may prepare it, but the just will wear it And the innocent will divide the silver.
Job	Job	18	27	18	"He has built his house like the spider's web, Or as a hut which the watchman has made.
Job	Job	18	27	19	"He lies down rich, but never again; He opens his eyes, and it is no longer.
Job	Job	18	27	20	"Terrors overtake him like a flood; A tempest steals him away in the night.
Job	Job	18	27	21	"The east wind carries him away, and he is gone, For it whirls him away from his place.
Job	Job	18	27	22	"For it will hurl at him without sparing; He will surely try to flee from its power.
Job	Job	18	27	23	"Men will clap their hands at him And will hiss him from his place.
Job	Job	18	28	1	"Surely there is a mine for silver And a place where they refine gold.
Job	Job	18	28	2	"Iron is taken from the dust, And copper is smelted from rock.
Job	Job	18	28	3	"Man puts an end to darkness, And to the farthest limit he searches out The rock in gloom and deep shadow.
Job	Job	18	28	4	"He sinks a shaft far from habitation, Forgotten by the foot; They hang and swing to and fro far from men.
Job	Job	18	28	5	"The earth, from it comes food, And underneath it is turned up as fire.
Job	Job	18	28	6	"Its rocks are the source of sapphires, And its dust contains gold.
Job	Job	18	28	7	"The path no bird of prey knows, Nor has the falcon's eye caught sight of it.
Job	Job	18	28	8	"The proud beasts have not trodden it, Nor has the fierce lion passed over it.
Job	Job	18	28	9	"He puts his hand on the flint; He overturns the mountains at the base.
Job	Job	18	28	10	"He hews out channels through the rocks, And his eye sees anything precious.
Job	Job	18	28	11	"He dams up the streams from flowing, And what is hidden he brings out to the light.
Job	Job	18	28	12	"But where can wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding?
Job	Job	18	28	13	"Man does not know its value, Nor is it found in the land of the living.
Job	Job	18	28	14	"The deep says, 'It is not in me'; And the sea says, 'It is not with me.'
Job	Job	18	28	15	"Pure gold cannot be given in exchange for it, Nor can silver be weighed as its price.
Job	Job	18	28	16	"It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir, In precious onyx, or sapphire.
Job	Job	18	28	17	"Gold or glass cannot equal it, Nor can it be exchanged for articles of fine gold.
Job	Job	18	28	18	"Coral and crystal are not to be mentioned; And the acquisition of wisdom is above that of pearls.
Job	Job	18	28	19	"The topaz of Ethiopia cannot equal it, Nor can it be valued in pure gold.
Job	Job	18	28	20	"Where then does wisdom come from? And where is the place of understanding?
Job	Job	18	28	21	"Thus it is hidden from the eyes of all living And concealed from the birds of the sky.
Job	Job	18	28	22	"Abaddon and Death say, 'With our ears we have heard a report of it.'
Job	Job	18	28	23	"God understands its way, And He knows its place.
Job	Job	18	28	24	"For He looks to the ends of the earth And sees everything under the heavens.
Job	Job	18	28	25	"When He imparted weight to the wind And meted out the waters by measure,
Job	Job	18	28	26	When He set a limit for the rain And a course for the thunderbolt,
Job	Job	18	28	27	Then He saw it and declared it; He established it and also searched it out.
Job	Job	18	28	28	"And to man He said, 'Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; And to depart from evil is understanding.'"
Job	Job	18	29	1	And Job again took up his discourse and said,
Job	Job	18	29	2	"Oh that I were as in months gone by, As in the days when God watched over me;
Job	Job	18	29	3	When His lamp shone over my head, And by His light I walked through darkness;
Job	Job	18	29	4	As I was in the prime of my days, When the friendship of God was over my tent;
Job	Job	18	29	5	When the Almighty was yet with me, And my children were around me;
Job	Job	18	29	6	When my steps were bathed in butter, And the rock poured out for me streams of oil!
Job	Job	18	29	7	"When I went out to the gate of the city, When I took my seat in the square,
Job	Job	18	29	8	The young men saw me and hid themselves, And the old men arose and stood.
Job	Job	18	29	9	"The princes stopped talking And put their hands on their mouths;
Job	Job	18	29	10	The voice of the nobles was hushed, And their tongue stuck to their palate.
Job	Job	18	29	11	"For when the ear heard, it called me blessed, And when the eye saw, it gave witness of me,
Job	Job	18	29	12	Because I delivered the poor who cried for help, And the orphan who had no helper.
Job	Job	18	29	13	"The blessing of the one ready to perish came upon me, And I made the widow's heart sing for joy.
Job	Job	18	29	14	"I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; My justice was like a robe and a turban.
Job	Job	18	29	15	"I was eyes to the blind And feet to the lame.
Job	Job	18	29	16	"I was a father to the needy, And I investigated the case which I did not know.
Job	Job	18	29	17	"I broke the jaws of the wicked And snatched the prey from his teeth.
Job	Job	18	29	18	"Then I thought, 'I shall die in my nest, And I shall multiply my days as the sand.
Job	Job	18	29	19	'My root is spread out to the waters, And dew lies all night on my branch.
Job	Job	18	29	20	'My glory is ever new with me, And my bow is renewed in my hand.'
Job	Job	18	29	21	"To me they listened and waited, And kept silent for my counsel.
Job	Job	18	29	22	"After my words they did not speak again, And my speech dropped on them.
Job	Job	18	29	23	"They waited for me as for the rain, And opened their mouth as for the spring rain.
Job	Job	18	29	24	"I smiled on them when they did not believe, And the light of my face they did not cast down.
Job	Job	18	29	25	"I chose a way for them and sat as chief, And dwelt as a king among the troops, As one who comforted the mourners.
Job	Job	18	30	1	"But now those younger than I mock me, Whose fathers I disdained to put with the dogs of my flock.
Job	Job	18	30	2	"Indeed, what good was the strength of their hands to me? Vigor had perished from them.
Job	Job	18	30	3	"From want and famine they are gaunt Who gnaw the dry ground by night in waste and desolation,
Job	Job	18	30	4	Who pluck mallow by the bushes, And whose food is the root of the broom shrub.
Job	Job	18	30	5	"They are driven from the community; They shout against them as against a thief,
Job	Job	18	30	6	So that they dwell in dreadful valleys, In holes of the earth and of the rocks.
Job	Job	18	30	7	"Among the bushes they cry out; Under the nettles they are gathered together.
Job	Job	18	30	8	"Fools, even those without a name, They were scourged from the land.
Job	Job	18	30	9	"And now I have become their taunt, I have even become a byword to them.
Job	Job	18	30	10	"They abhor me and stand aloof from me, And they do not refrain from spitting at my face.
Job	Job	18	30	11	"Because He has loosed His bowstring and afflicted me, They have cast off the bridle before me.
Job	Job	18	30	12	"On the right hand their brood arises; They thrust aside my feet and build up against me their ways of destruction.
Job	Job	18	30	13	"They break up my path, They profit from my destruction; No one restrains them.
Job	Job	18	30	14	"As through a wide breach they come, Amid the tempest they roll on.
Job	Job	18	30	15	"Terrors are turned against me; They pursue my honor as the wind, And my prosperity has passed away like a cloud.
Job	Job	18	30	16	"And now my soul is poured out within me; Days of affliction have seized me.
Job	Job	18	30	17	"At night it pierces my bones within me, And my gnawing pains take no rest.
Job	Job	18	30	18	"By a great force my garment is distorted; It binds me about as the collar of my coat.
Job	Job	18	30	19	"He has cast me into the mire, And I have become like dust and ashes.
Job	Job	18	30	20	"I cry out to You for help, but You do not answer me; I stand up, and You turn Your attention against me.
Job	Job	18	30	21	"You have become cruel to me; With the might of Your hand You persecute me.
Job	Job	18	30	22	"You lift me up to the wind and cause me to ride; And You dissolve me in a storm.
Job	Job	18	30	23	"For I know that You will bring me to death And to the house of meeting for all living.
Job	Job	18	30	24	"Yet does not one in a heap of ruins stretch out his hand, Or in his disaster therefore cry out for help?
Job	Job	18	30	25	"Have I not wept for the one whose life is hard? Was not my soul grieved for the needy?
Job	Job	18	30	26	"When I expected good, then evil came; When I waited for light, then darkness came.
Job	Job	18	30	27	"I am seething within and cannot relax; Days of affliction confront me.
Job	Job	18	30	28	"I go about mourning without comfort; I stand up in the assembly and cry out for help.
Job	Job	18	30	29	"I have become a brother to jackals And a companion of ostriches.
Job	Job	18	30	30	"My skin turns black on me, And my bones burn with fever.
Job	Job	18	30	31	"Therefore my harp is turned to mourning, And my flute to the sound of those who weep.
Job	Job	18	31	1	"I have made a covenant with my eyes; How then could I gaze at a virgin?
Job	Job	18	31	2	"And what is the portion of God from above Or the heritage of the Almighty from on high?
Job	Job	18	31	3	"Is it not calamity to the unjust And disaster to those who work iniquity?
Job	Job	18	31	4	"Does He not see my ways And number all my steps?
Job	Job	18	31	5	"If I have walked with falsehood, And my foot has hastened after deceit,
Job	Job	18	31	6	Let Him weigh me with accurate scales, And let God know my integrity.
Job	Job	18	31	7	"If my step has turned from the way, Or my heart followed my eyes, Or if any spot has stuck to my hands,
Job	Job	18	31	8	Let me sow and another eat, And let my crops be uprooted.
Job	Job	18	31	9	"If my heart has been enticed by a woman, Or I have lurked at my neighbor's doorway,
Job	Job	18	31	10	May my wife grind for another, And let others kneel down over her.
Job	Job	18	31	11	"For that would be a lustful crime; Moreover, it would be an iniquity punishable by judges.
Job	Job	18	31	12	"For it would be fire that consumes to Abaddon, And would uproot all my increase.
Job	Job	18	31	13	"If I have despised the claim of my male or female slaves When they filed a complaint against me,
Job	Job	18	31	14	What then could I do when God arises? And when He calls me to account, what will I answer Him?
Job	Job	18	31	15	"Did not He who made me in the womb make him, And the same one fashion us in the womb?
Job	Job	18	31	16	"If I have kept the poor from their desire, Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,
Job	Job	18	31	17	Or have eaten my morsel alone, And the orphan has not shared it
Job	Job	18	31	18	(But from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, And from infancy I guided her),
Job	Job	18	31	19	If I have seen anyone perish for lack of clothing, Or that the needy had no covering,
Job	Job	18	31	20	If his loins have not thanked me, And if he has not been warmed with the fleece of my sheep,
Job	Job	18	31	21	If I have lifted up my hand against the orphan, Because I saw I had support in the gate,
Job	Job	18	31	22	Let my shoulder fall from the socket, And my arm be broken off at the elbow.
Job	Job	18	31	23	"For calamity from God is a terror to me, And because of His majesty I can do nothing.
Job	Job	18	31	24	"If I have put my confidence in gold, And called fine gold my trust,
Job	Job	18	31	25	If I have gloated because my wealth was great, And because my hand had secured so much;
Job	Job	18	31	26	If I have looked at the sun when it shone Or the moon going in splendor,
Job	Job	18	31	27	And my heart became secretly enticed, And my hand threw a kiss from my mouth,
Job	Job	18	31	28	That too would have been an iniquity calling for judgment, For I would have denied God above.
Job	Job	18	31	29	"Have I rejoiced at the extinction of my enemy, Or exulted when evil befell him?
Job	Job	18	31	30	"No, I have not allowed my mouth to sin By asking for his life in a curse.
Job	Job	18	31	31	"Have the men of my tent not said, 'Who can find one who has not been satisfied with his meat'?
Job	Job	18	31	32	"The alien has not lodged outside, For I have opened my doors to the traveler.
Job	Job	18	31	33	"Have I covered my transgressions like Adam, By hiding my iniquity in my bosom,
Job	Job	18	31	34	Because I feared the great multitude, And the contempt of families terrified me, And kept silent and did not go out of doors?
Job	Job	18	31	35	"Oh that I had one to hear me! Behold, here is my signature; Let the Almighty answer me! And the indictment which my adversary has written,
Job	Job	18	31	36	Surely I would carry it on my shoulder, I would bind it to myself like a crown.
Job	Job	18	31	37	"I would declare to Him the number of my steps; Like a prince I would approach Him.
Job	Job	18	31	38	"If my land cries out against me, And its furrows weep together;
Job	Job	18	31	39	If I have eaten its fruit without money, Or have caused its owners to lose their lives,
Job	Job	18	31	40	Let briars grow instead of wheat, And stinkweed instead of barley." The words of Job are ended.
Job	Job	18	32	1	Then these three men ceased answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
Job	Job	18	32	2	But the anger of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram burned; against Job his anger burned because he justified himself before God.
Job	Job	18	32	3	And his anger burned against his three friends because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.
Job	Job	18	32	4	Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because they were years older than he.
Job	Job	18	32	5	And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men his anger burned.
Job	Job	18	32	6	So Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite spoke out and said, "I am young in years and you are old; Therefore I was shy and afraid to tell you what I think.
Job	Job	18	32	7	"I thought age should speak, And increased years should teach wisdom.
Job	Job	18	32	8	"But it is a spirit in man, And the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding.
Job	Job	18	32	9	"The abundant in years may not be wise, Nor may elders understand justice.
Job	Job	18	32	10	"So I say, 'Listen to me, I too will tell what I think.'
Job	Job	18	32	11	"Behold, I waited for your words, I listened to your reasonings, While you pondered what to say.
Job	Job	18	32	12	"I even paid close attention to you; Indeed, there was no one who refuted Job, Not one of you who answered his words.
Job	Job	18	32	13	"Do not say, 'We have found wisdom; God will rout him, not man.'
Job	Job	18	32	14	"For he has not arranged his words against me, Nor will I reply to him with your arguments.
Job	Job	18	32	15	"They are dismayed, they no longer answer; Words have failed them.
Job	Job	18	32	16	"Shall I wait, because they do not speak, Because they stop and no longer answer?
Job	Job	18	32	17	"I too will answer my share, I also will tell my opinion.
Job	Job	18	32	18	"For I am full of words; The spirit within me constrains me.
Job	Job	18	32	19	"Behold, my belly is like unvented wine, Like new wineskins it is about to burst.
Job	Job	18	32	20	"Let me speak that I may get relief; Let me open my lips and answer.
Job	Job	18	32	21	"Let me now be partial to no one, Nor flatter any man.
Job	Job	18	32	22	"For I do not know how to flatter, Else my Maker would soon take me away.
Job	Job	18	33	1	"However now, Job, please hear my speech, And listen to all my words.
Job	Job	18	33	2	"Behold now, I open my mouth, My tongue in my mouth speaks.
Job	Job	18	33	3	"My words are from the uprightness of my heart, And my lips speak knowledge sincerely.
Job	Job	18	33	4	"The Spirit of God has made me, And the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
Job	Job	18	33	5	"Refute me if you can; Array yourselves before me, take your stand.
Job	Job	18	33	6	"Behold, I belong to God like you; I too have been formed out of the clay.
Job	Job	18	33	7	"Behold, no fear of me should terrify you, Nor should my pressure weigh heavily on you.
Job	Job	18	33	8	"Surely you have spoken in my hearing, And I have heard the sound of your words:
Job	Job	18	33	9	'I am pure, without transgression; I am innocent and there is no guilt in me.
Job	Job	18	33	10	'Behold, He invents pretexts against me; He counts me as His enemy.
Job	Job	18	33	11	'He puts my feet in the stocks; He watches all my paths.'
Job	Job	18	33	12	"Behold, let me tell you, you are not right in this, For God is greater than man.
Job	Job	18	33	13	"Why do you complain against Him That He does not give an account of all His doings?
Job	Job	18	33	14	"Indeed God speaks once, Or twice, yet no one notices it.
Job	Job	18	33	15	"In a dream, a vision of the night, When sound sleep falls on men, While they slumber in their beds,
Job	Job	18	33	16	Then He opens the ears of men, And seals their instruction,
Job	Job	18	33	17	That He may turn man aside from his conduct, And keep man from pride;
Job	Job	18	33	18	He keeps back his soul from the pit, And his life from passing over into Sheol.
Job	Job	18	33	19	"Man is also chastened with pain on his bed, And with unceasing complaint in his bones;
Job	Job	18	33	20	So that his life loathes bread, And his soul favorite food.
Job	Job	18	33	21	"His flesh wastes away from sight, And his bones which were not seen stick out.
Job	Job	18	33	22	"Then his soul draws near to the pit, And his life to those who bring death.
Job	Job	18	33	23	"If there is an angel as mediator for him, One out of a thousand, To remind a man what is right for him,
Job	Job	18	33	24	Then let him be gracious to him, and say, 'Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom';
Job	Job	18	33	25	Let his flesh become fresher than in youth, Let him return to the days of his youthful vigor;
Job	Job	18	33	26	Then he will pray to God, and He will accept him, That he may see His face with joy, And He may restore His righteousness to man.
Job	Job	18	33	27	"He will sing to men and say, 'I have sinned and perverted what is right, And it is not proper for me.
Job	Job	18	33	28	'He has redeemed my soul from going to the pit, And my life shall see the light.'
Job	Job	18	33	29	"Behold, God does all these oftentimes with men,
Job	Job	18	33	30	To bring back his soul from the pit, That he may be enlightened with the light of life.
Job	Job	18	33	31	"Pay attention, O Job, listen to me; Keep silent, and let me speak.
Job	Job	18	33	32	"Then if you have anything to say, answer me; Speak, for I desire to justify you.
Job	Job	18	33	33	"If not, listen to me; Keep silent, and I will teach you wisdom."
Job	Job	18	34	1	Then Elihu continued and said,
Job	Job	18	34	2	"Hear my words, you wise men, And listen to me, you who know.
Job	Job	18	34	3	"For the ear tests words As the palate tastes food.
Job	Job	18	34	4	"Let us choose for ourselves what is right; Let us know among ourselves what is good.
Job	Job	18	34	5	"For Job has said, 'I am righteous, But God has taken away my right;
Job	Job	18	34	6	Should I lie concerning my right? My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.'
Job	Job	18	34	7	"What man is like Job, Who drinks up derision like water,
Job	Job	18	34	8	Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity, And walks with wicked men?
Job	Job	18	34	9	"For he has said, 'It profits a man nothing When he is pleased with God.'
Job	Job	18	34	10	"Therefore, listen to me, you men of understanding. Far be it from God to do wickedness, And from the Almighty to do wrong.
Job	Job	18	34	11	"For He pays a man according to his work, And makes him find it according to his way.
Job	Job	18	34	12	"Surely, God will not act wickedly, And the Almighty will not pervert justice.
Job	Job	18	34	13	"Who gave Him authority over the earth? And who has laid on Him the whole world?
Job	Job	18	34	14	"If He should determine to do so, If He should gather to Himself His spirit and His breath,
Job	Job	18	34	15	All flesh would perish together, And man would return to dust.
Job	Job	18	34	16	"But if you have understanding, hear this; Listen to the sound of my words.
Job	Job	18	34	17	"Shall one who hates justice rule? And will you condemn the righteous mighty One,
Job	Job	18	34	18	Who says to a king, 'Worthless one,' To nobles, 'Wicked ones';
Job	Job	18	34	19	Who shows no partiality to princes Nor regards the rich above the poor, For they all are the work of His hands?
Job	Job	18	34	20	"In a moment they die, and at midnight People are shaken and pass away, And the mighty are taken away without a hand.
Job	Job	18	34	21	"For His eyes are upon the ways of a man, And He sees all his steps.
Job	Job	18	34	22	"There is no darkness or deep shadow Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
Job	Job	18	34	23	"For He does not need to consider a man further, That he should go before God in judgment.
Job	Job	18	34	24	"He breaks in pieces mighty men without inquiry, And sets others in their place.
Job	Job	18	34	25	"Therefore He knows their works, And He overthrows them in the night, And they are crushed.
Job	Job	18	34	26	"He strikes them like the wicked In a public place,
Job	Job	18	34	27	Because they turned aside from following Him, And had no regard for any of His ways;
Job	Job	18	34	28	So that they caused the cry of the poor to come to Him, And that He might hear the cry of the afflicted--
Job	Job	18	34	29	When He keeps quiet, who then can condemn? And when He hides His face, who then can behold Him, That is, in regard to both nation and man?--
Job	Job	18	34	30	So that godless men would not rule Nor be snares of the people.
Job	Job	18	34	31	"For has anyone said to God, 'I have borne chastisement; I will not offend anymore;
Job	Job	18	34	32	Teach me what I do not see; If I have done iniquity, I will not do it again'?
Job	Job	18	34	33	"Shall He recompense on your terms, because you have rejected it? For you must choose, and not I; Therefore declare what you know.
Job	Job	18	34	34	"Men of understanding will say to me, And a wise man who hears me,
Job	Job	18	34	35	'Job speaks without knowledge, And his words are without wisdom.
Job	Job	18	34	36	'Job ought to be tried to the limit, Because he answers like wicked men.
Job	Job	18	34	37	'For he adds rebellion to his sin; He claps his hands among us, And multiplies his words against God.'"
Job	Job	18	35	1	Then Elihu continued and said,
Job	Job	18	35	2	"Do you think this is according to justice? Do you say, 'My righteousness is more than God's'?
Job	Job	18	35	3	"For you say, 'What advantage will it be to You? What profit will I have, more than if I had sinned?'
Job	Job	18	35	4	"I will answer you, And your friends with you.
Job	Job	18	35	5	"Look at the heavens and see; And behold the clouds--they are higher than you.
Job	Job	18	35	6	"If you have sinned, what do you accomplish against Him? And if your transgressions are many, what do you do to Him?
Job	Job	18	35	7	"If you are righteous, what do you give to Him, Or what does He receive from your hand?
Job	Job	18	35	8	"Your wickedness is for a man like yourself, And your righteousness is for a son of man.
Job	Job	18	35	9	"Because of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; They cry for help because of the arm of the mighty.
Job	Job	18	35	10	"But no one says, 'Where is God my Maker, Who gives songs in the night,
Job	Job	18	35	11	Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth And makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens?'
Job	Job	18	35	12	"There they cry out, but He does not answer Because of the pride of evil men.
Job	Job	18	35	13	"Surely God will not listen to an empty cry, Nor will the Almighty regard it.
Job	Job	18	35	14	"How much less when you say you do not behold Him, The case is before Him, and you must wait for Him!
Job	Job	18	35	15	"And now, because He has not visited in His anger, Nor has He acknowledged transgression well,
Job	Job	18	35	16	So Job opens his mouth emptily; He multiplies words without knowledge."
Job	Job	18	36	1	Then Elihu continued and said,
Job	Job	18	36	2	"Wait for me a little, and I will show you That there is yet more to be said in God's behalf.
Job	Job	18	36	3	"I will fetch my knowledge from afar, And I will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
Job	Job	18	36	4	"For truly my words are not false; One who is perfect in knowledge is with you.
Job	Job	18	36	5	"Behold, God is mighty but does not despise any; He is mighty in strength of understanding.
Job	Job	18	36	6	"He does not keep the wicked alive, But gives justice to the afflicted.
Job	Job	18	36	7	"He does not withdraw His eyes from the righteous; But with kings on the throne He has seated them forever, and they are exalted.
Job	Job	18	36	8	"And if they are bound in fetters, And are caught in the cords of affliction,
Job	Job	18	36	9	Then He declares to them their work And their transgressions, that they have magnified themselves.
Job	Job	18	36	10	"He opens their ear to instruction, And commands that they return from evil.
Job	Job	18	36	11	"If they hear and serve Him, They will end their days in prosperity And their years in pleasures.
Job	Job	18	36	12	"But if they do not hear, they shall perish by the sword And they will die without knowledge.
Job	Job	18	36	13	"But the godless in heart lay up anger; They do not cry for help when He binds them.
Job	Job	18	36	14	"They die in youth, And their life perishes among the cult prostitutes.
Job	Job	18	36	15	"He delivers the afflicted in their affliction, And opens their ear in time of oppression.
Job	Job	18	36	16	"Then indeed, He enticed you from the mouth of distress, Instead of it, a broad place with no constraint; And that which was set on your table was full of fatness.
Job	Job	18	36	17	"But you were full of judgment on the wicked; Judgment and justice take hold of you.
Job	Job	18	36	18	"Beware that wrath does not entice you to scoffing; And do not let the greatness of the ransom turn you aside.
Job	Job	18	36	19	"Will your riches keep you from distress, Or all the forces of your strength?
Job	Job	18	36	20	"Do not long for the night, When people vanish in their place.
Job	Job	18	36	21	"Be careful, do not turn to evil, For you have preferred this to affliction.
Job	Job	18	36	22	"Behold, God is exalted in His power; Who is a teacher like Him?
Job	Job	18	36	23	"Who has appointed Him His way, And who has said, 'You have done wrong'?
Job	Job	18	36	24	"Remember that you should exalt His work, Of which men have sung.
Job	Job	18	36	25	"All men have seen it; Man beholds from afar.
Job	Job	18	36	26	"Behold, God is exalted, and we do not know Him; The number of His years is unsearchable.
Job	Job	18	36	27	"For He draws up the drops of water, They distill rain from the mist,
Job	Job	18	36	28	Which the clouds pour down, They drip upon man abundantly.
Job	Job	18	36	29	"Can anyone understand the spreading of the clouds, The thundering of His pavilion?
Job	Job	18	36	30	"Behold, He spreads His lightning about Him, And He covers the depths of the sea.
Job	Job	18	36	31	"For by these He judges peoples; He gives food in abundance.
Job	Job	18	36	32	"He covers His hands with the lightning, And commands it to strike the mark.
Job	Job	18	36	33	"Its noise declares His presence; The cattle also, concerning what is coming up.
Job	Job	18	37	1	"At this also my heart trembles, And leaps from its place.
Job	Job	18	37	2	"Listen closely to the thunder of His voice, And the rumbling that goes out from His mouth.
Job	Job	18	37	3	"Under the whole heaven He lets it loose, And His lightning to the ends of the earth.
Job	Job	18	37	4	"After it, a voice roars; He thunders with His majestic voice, And He does not restrain the lightnings when His voice is heard.
Job	Job	18	37	5	"God thunders with His voice wondrously, Doing great things which we cannot comprehend.
Job	Job	18	37	6	"For to the snow He says, 'Fall on the earth,' And to the downpour and the rain, 'Be strong.'
Job	Job	18	37	7	"He seals the hand of every man, That all men may know His work.
Job	Job	18	37	8	"Then the beast goes into its lair And remains in its den.

Job	Job	18	37	11	"Also with moisture He loads the thick cloud; He disperses the cloud of His lightning.
Job	Job	18	37	12	"It changes direction, turning around by His guidance, That it may do whatever He commands it On the face of the inhabited earth.
Job	Job	18	37	13	"Whether for correction, or for His world, Or for lovingkindness, He causes it to happen.
Job	Job	18	37	14	"Listen to this, O Job, Stand and consider the wonders of God.
Job	Job	18	37	15	"Do you know how God establishes them, And makes the lightning of His cloud to shine?
Job	Job	18	37	16	"Do you know about the layers of the thick clouds, The wonders of one perfect in knowledge,
Job	Job	18	37	17	You whose garments are hot, When the land is still because of the south wind?
Job	Job	18	37	18	"Can you, with Him, spread out the skies, Strong as a molten mirror?
Job	Job	18	37	19	"Teach us what we shall say to Him; We cannot arrange our case because of darkness.
Job	Job	18	37	20	"Shall it be told Him that I would speak? Or should a man say that he would be swallowed up?
Job	Job	18	37	21	"Now men do not see the light which is bright in the skies; But the wind has passed and cleared them.
Job	Job	18	37	22	"Out of the north comes golden splendor; Around God is awesome majesty.
Job	Job	18	37	23	"The Almighty--we cannot find Him; He is exalted in power And He will not do violence to justice and abundant righteousness.
Job	Job	18	37	24	"Therefore men fear Him; He does not regard any who are wise of heart."
Job	Job	18	38	1	Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said,
Job	Job	18	38	2	"Who is this that darkens counsel By words without knowledge?

Job	Job	18	38	5	Who set its measurements? Since you know. Or who stretched the line on it?
Job	Job	18	38	6	"On what were its bases sunk? Or who laid its cornerstone,
Job	Job	18	38	7	When the morning stars sang together And all the sons of God shouted for joy?
Job	Job	18	38	8	"Or who enclosed the sea with doors When, bursting forth, it went out from the womb;

Job	Job	18	38	10	And I placed boundaries on it And set a bolt and doors,
Job	Job	18	38	11	And I said, 'Thus far you shall come, but no farther; And here shall your proud waves stop'?

Job	Job	18	38	13	That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, And the wicked be shaken out of it?
Job	Job	18	38	14	"It is changed like clay under the seal; And they stand forth like a garment.
Job	Job	18	38	15	"From the wicked their light is withheld, And the uplifted arm is broken.
Job	Job	18	38	16	"Have you entered into the springs of the sea Or walked in the recesses of the deep?
Job	Job	18	38	17	"Have the gates of death been revealed to you, Or have you seen the gates of deep darkness?
Job	Job	18	38	18	"Have you understood the expanse of the earth? Tell Me, if you know all this.
Job	Job	18	38	19	"Where is the way to the dwelling of light? And darkness, where is its place,
Job	Job	18	38	20	That you may take it to its territory And that you may discern the paths to its home?
Job	Job	18	38	21	"You know, for you were born then, And the number of your days is great!
Job	Job	18	38	22	"Have you entered the storehouses of the snow, Or have you seen the storehouses of the hail,
Job	Job	18	38	23	Which I have reserved for the time of distress, For the day of war and battle?
Job	Job	18	38	24	"Where is the way that the light is divided, Or the east wind scattered on the earth?
Job	Job	18	38	25	"Who has cleft a channel for the flood, Or a way for the thunderbolt,
Job	Job	18	38	26	To bring rain on a land without people, On a desert without a man in it,

Job	Job	18	38	29	"From whose womb has come the ice? And the frost of heaven, who has given it birth?
Job	Job	18	38	30	"Water becomes hard like stone, And the surface of the deep is imprisoned.
Job	Job	18	38	31	"Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades, Or loose the cords of Orion?
Job	Job	18	38	32	"Can you lead forth a constellation in its season, And guide the Bear with her satellites?
Job	Job	18	38	33	"Do you know the ordinances of the heavens, Or fix their rule over the earth?
Job	Job	18	38	34	"Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, So that an abundance of water will cover you?
Job	Job	18	38	35	"Can you send forth lightnings that they may go And say to you, 'Here we are'?
Job	Job	18	38	36	"Who has put wisdom in the innermost being Or given understanding to the mind?
Job	Job	18	38	37	"Who can count the clouds by wisdom, Or tip the water jars of the heavens,
Job	Job	18	38	38	When the dust hardens into a mass And the clods stick together?
Job	Job	18	38	39	"Can you hunt the prey for the lion, Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,
Job	Job	18	38	40	When they crouch in their dens And lie in wait in their lair?
Job	Job	18	38	41	"Who prepares for the raven its nourishment When its young cry to God And wander about without food?

Job	Job	18	39	2	"Can you count the months they fulfill, Or do you know the time they give birth?
Job	Job	18	39	3	"They kneel down, they bring forth their young, They get rid of their labor pains.
Job	Job	18	39	4	"Their offspring become strong, they grow up in the open field; They leave and do not return to them.
Job	Job	18	39	5	"Who sent out the wild donkey free? And who loosed the bonds of the swift donkey,
Job	Job	18	39	6	To whom I gave the wilderness for a home And the salt land for his dwelling place?
Job	Job	18	39	7	"He scorns the tumult of the city, The shoutings of the driver he does not hear.
Job	Job	18	39	8	"He explores the mountains for his pasture And searches after every green thing.
Job	Job	18	39	9	"Will the wild ox consent to serve you, Or will he spend the night at your manger?
Job	Job	18	39	10	"Can you bind the wild ox in a furrow with ropes, Or will he harrow the valleys after you?

Job	Job	18	39	12	"Will you have faith in him that he will return your grain And gather it from your threshing floor?
Job	Job	18	39	13	"The ostriches' wings flap joyously With the pinion and plumage of love,
Job	Job	18	39	14	For she abandons her eggs to the earth And warms them in the dust,
Job	Job	18	39	15	And she forgets that a foot may crush them, Or that a wild beast may trample them.
Job	Job	18	39	16	"She treats her young cruelly, as if they were not hers; Though her labor be in vain, she is unconcerned;
Job	Job	18	39	17	Because God has made her forget wisdom, And has not given her a share of understanding.
Job	Job	18	39	18	"When she lifts herself on high, She laughs at the horse and his rider.
Job	Job	18	39	19	"Do you give the horse his might? Do you clothe his neck with a mane?
Job	Job	18	39	20	"Do you make him leap like the locust? His majestic snorting is terrible.
Job	Job	18	39	21	"He paws in the valley, and rejoices in his strength; He goes out to meet the weapons.
Job	Job	18	39	22	"He laughs at fear and is not dismayed; And he does not turn back from the sword.
Job	Job	18	39	23	"The quiver rattles against him, The flashing spear and javelin.
Job	Job	18	39	24	"With shaking and rage he races over the ground, And he does not stand still at the voice of the trumpet.
Job	Job	18	39	25	"As often as the trumpet sounds he says, 'Aha!' And he scents the battle from afar, And the thunder of the captains and the war cry.
Job	Job	18	39	26	"Is it by your understanding that the hawk soars, Stretching his wings toward the south?
Job	Job	18	39	27	"Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up And makes his nest on high?
Job	Job	18	39	28	"On the cliff he dwells and lodges, Upon the rocky crag, an inaccessible place.
Job	Job	18	39	29	"From there he spies out food; His eyes see it from afar.
Job	Job	18	39	30	"His young ones also suck up blood; And where the slain are, there is he."
Job	Job	18	40	1	Then the LORD said to Job,
Job	Job	18	40	2	"Will the faultfinder contend with the Almighty? Let him who reproves God answer it."
Job	Job	18	40	3	Then Job answered the LORD and said,
Job	Job	18	40	4	"Behold, I am insignificant; what can I reply to You? I lay my hand on my mouth.
Job	Job	18	40	5	"Once I have spoken, and I will not answer; Even twice, and I will add nothing more."
Job	Job	18	40	6	Then the LORD answered Job out of the storm and said,
Job	Job	18	40	7	"Now gird up your loins like a man; I will ask you, and you instruct Me.
Job	Job	18	40	8	"Will you really annul My judgment? Will you condemn Me that you may be justified?
Job	Job	18	40	9	"Or do you have an arm like God, And can you thunder with a voice like His?
Job	Job	18	40	10	"Adorn yourself with eminence and dignity, And clothe yourself with honor and majesty.
Job	Job	18	40	11	"Pour out the overflowings of your anger, And look on everyone who is proud, and make him low.
Job	Job	18	40	12	"Look on everyone who is proud, and humble him, And tread down the wicked where they stand.
Job	Job	18	40	13	"Hide them in the dust together; Bind them in the hidden place.
Job	Job	18	40	14	"Then I will also confess to you, That your own right hand can save you.
Job	Job	18	40	15	"Behold now, Behemoth, which I made as well as you; He eats grass like an ox.
Job	Job	18	40	16	"Behold now, his strength in his loins And his power in the muscles of his belly.
Job	Job	18	40	17	"He bends his tail like a cedar; The sinews of his thighs are knit together.
Job	Job	18	40	18	"His bones are tubes of bronze; His limbs are like bars of iron.
Job	Job	18	40	19	"He is the first of the ways of God; Let his maker bring near his sword.
Job	Job	18	40	20	"Surely the mountains bring him food, And all the beasts of the field play there.
Job	Job	18	40	21	"Under the lotus plants he lies down, In the covert of the reeds and the marsh.
Job	Job	18	40	22	"The lotus plants cover him with shade; The willows of the brook surround him.
Job	Job	18	40	23	"If a river rages, he is not alarmed; He is confident, though the Jordan rushes to his mouth.
Job	Job	18	40	24	"Can anyone capture him when he is on watch, With barbs can anyone pierce his nose?
Job	Job	18	41	1	"Can you draw out Leviathan with a fishhook? Or press down his tongue with a cord?
Job	Job	18	41	2	"Can you put a rope in his nose Or pierce his jaw with a hook?
Job	Job	18	41	3	"Will he make many supplications to you, Or will he speak to you soft words?
Job	Job	18	41	4	"Will he make a covenant with you? Will you take him for a servant forever?
Job	Job	18	41	5	"Will you play with him as with a bird, Or will you bind him for your maidens?
Job	Job	18	41	6	"Will the traders bargain over him? Will they divide him among the merchants?
Job	Job	18	41	7	"Can you fill his skin with harpoons, Or his head with fishing spears?
Job	Job	18	41	8	"Lay your hand on him; Remember the battle; you will not do it again!
Job	Job	18	41	9	"Behold, your expectation is false; Will you be laid low even at the sight of him?
Job	Job	18	41	10	"No one is so fierce that he dares to arouse him; Who then is he that can stand before Me?
Job	Job	18	41	11	"Who has given to Me that I should repay him? Whatever is under the whole heaven is Mine.
Job	Job	18	41	12	"I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, Or his mighty strength, or his orderly frame.

Job	Job	18	41	16	"One is so near to another That no air can come between them.
Job	Job	18	41	17	"They are joined one to another; They clasp each other and cannot be separated.
Job	Job	18	41	18	"His sneezes flash forth light, And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.
Job	Job	18	41	19	"Out of his mouth go burning torches; Sparks of fire leap forth.
Job	Job	18	41	20	"Out of his nostrils smoke goes forth As from a boiling pot and burning rushes.
Job	Job	18	41	21	"His breath kindles coals, And a flame goes forth from his mouth.
Job	Job	18	41	22	"In his neck lodges strength, And dismay leaps before him.
Job	Job	18	41	23	"The folds of his flesh are joined together, Firm on him and immovable.
Job	Job	18	41	24	"His heart is as hard as a stone, Even as hard as a lower millstone.
Job	Job	18	41	25	"When he raises himself up, the mighty fear; Because of the crashing they are bewildered.
Job	Job	18	41	26	"The sword that reaches him cannot avail, Nor the spear, the dart or the javelin.
Job	Job	18	41	27	"He regards iron as straw, Bronze as rotten wood.
Job	Job	18	41	28	"The arrow cannot make him flee; Slingstones are turned into stubble for him.
Job	Job	18	41	29	"Clubs are regarded as stubble; He laughs at the rattling of the javelin.
Job	Job	18	41	30	"His underparts are like sharp potsherds; He spreads out like a threshing sledge on the mire.
Job	Job	18	41	31	"He makes the depths boil like a pot; He makes the sea like a jar of ointment.
Job	Job	18	41	32	"Behind him he makes a wake to shine; One would think the deep to be gray-haired.
Job	Job	18	41	33	"Nothing on earth is like him, One made without fear.
Job	Job	18	41	34	"He looks on everything that is high; He is king over all the sons of pride."
Job	Job	18	42	1	Then Job answered the LORD and said,
Job	Job	18	42	2	"I know that You can do all things, And that no purpose of Yours can be thwarted.
Job	Job	18	42	3	'Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge?' "Therefore I have declared that which I did not understand, Things too wonderful for me, which I did not know."
Job	Job	18	42	4	'Hear, now, and I will speak; I will ask You, and You instruct me.'
Job	Job	18	42	5	"I have heard of You by the hearing of the ear; But now my eye sees You;
Job	Job	18	42	6	Therefore I retract, And I repent in dust and ashes."
Job	Job	18	42	7	It came about after the LORD had spoken these words to Job, that the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, "My wrath is kindled against you and against your two friends, because you have not spoken of Me what is right as My servant Job has.
Job	Job	18	42	8	"Now therefore, take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, and go to My servant Job, and offer up a burnt offering for yourselves, and My servant Job will pray for you. For I will accept him so that I may not do with you according to your folly, because you have not spoken of Me what is right, as My servant Job has."
Job	Job	18	42	9	So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as the LORD told them; and the LORD accepted Job.
Job	Job	18	42	10	The LORD restored the fortunes of Job when he prayed for his friends, and the LORD increased all that Job had twofold.
Job	Job	18	42	11	Then all his brothers and all his sisters and all who had known him before came to him, and they ate bread with him in his house; and they consoled him and comforted him for all the adversities that the LORD had brought on him. And each one gave him one piece of money, and each a ring of gold.
Job	Job	18	42	12	The LORD blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning; and he had 14,sheep and 6,000 camels and 1,000 yoke of oxen and 1,000 female donkeys.
Job	Job	18	42	13	He had seven sons and three daughters.
Job	Job	18	42	14	He named the first Jemimah, and the second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch.
Job	Job	18	42	15	In all the land no women were found so fair as Job's daughters; and their father gave them inheritance among their brothers.
Job	Job	18	42	16	After this, Job lived years, and saw his sons and his grandsons, four generations.
Job	Job	18	42	17	And Job died, an old man and full of days.
Psalms	Psa	19	1	1	How blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, Nor stand in the path of sinners, Nor sit in the seat of scoffers!
Psalms	Psa	19	1	2	But his delight is in the law of the LORD, And in His law he meditates day and night.
Psalms	Psa	19	1	3	He will be like a tree firmly planted by streams of water, Which yields its fruit in its season And its leaf does not wither; And in whatever he does, he prospers.
Psalms	Psa	19	1	4	The wicked are not so, But they are like chaff which the wind drives away.
Psalms	Psa	19	1	5	Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, Nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
Psalms	Psa	19	1	6	For the LORD knows the way of the righteous, But the way of the wicked will perish.
Psalms	Psa	19	2	1	Why are the nations in an uproar And the peoples devising a vain thing?
Psalms	Psa	19	2	2	The kings of the earth take their stand And the rulers take counsel together Against the LORD and against His Anointed, saying,
Psalms	Psa	19	2	3	"Let us tear their fetters apart And cast away their cords from us!"
Psalms	Psa	19	2	4	He who sits in the heavens laughs, The Lord scoffs at them.
Psalms	Psa	19	2	5	Then He will speak to them in His anger And terrify them in His fury, saying,
Psalms	Psa	19	2	6	"But as for Me, I have installed My King Upon Zion, My holy mountain."
Psalms	Psa	19	2	7	"I will surely tell of the decree of the LORD: He said to Me, 'You are My Son, Today I have begotten You.
Psalms	Psa	19	2	8	'Ask of Me, and I will surely give the nations as Your inheritance, And the very ends of the earth as Your possession.
Psalms	Psa	19	2	9	'You shall break them with a rod of iron, You shall shatter them like earthenware.'"
Psalms	Psa	19	2	10	Now therefore, O kings, show discernment; Take warning, O judges of the earth.
Psalms	Psa	19	2	11	Worship the LORD with reverence And rejoice with trembling.
Psalms	Psa	19	2	12	Do homage to the Son, that He not become angry, and you perish in the way, For His wrath may soon be kindled. How blessed are all who take refuge in Him!
Psalms	Psa	19	3	1	O LORD, how my adversaries have increased! Many are rising up against me.
Psalms	Psa	19	3	2	Many are saying of my soul, "There is no deliverance for him in God." Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	3	3	But You, O LORD, are a shield about me, My glory, and the One who lifts my head.
Psalms	Psa	19	3	4	I was crying to the LORD with my voice, And He answered me from His holy mountain. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	3	5	I lay down and slept; I awoke, for the LORD sustains me.
Psalms	Psa	19	3	6	I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people Who have set themselves against me round about.
Psalms	Psa	19	3	7	Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God! For You have smitten all my enemies on the cheek; You have shattered the teeth of the wicked.
Psalms	Psa	19	3	8	Salvation belongs to the LORD; Your blessing be upon Your people! Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	4	1	Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness! You have relieved me in my distress; Be gracious to me and hear my prayer.
Psalms	Psa	19	4	2	O sons of men, how long will my honor become a reproach? How long will you love what is worthless and aim at deception? Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	4	3	But know that the LORD has set apart the godly man for Himself; The LORD hears when I call to Him.
Psalms	Psa	19	4	4	Tremble, and do not sin; Meditate in your heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	4	5	Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, And trust in the LORD.
Psalms	Psa	19	4	6	Many are saying, "Who will show us any good?" Lift up the light of Your countenance upon us, O LORD!
Psalms	Psa	19	4	7	You have put gladness in my heart, More than when their grain and new wine abound.
Psalms	Psa	19	4	8	In peace I will both lie down and sleep, For You alone, O LORD, make me to dwell in safety.
Psalms	Psa	19	5	1	Give ear to my words, O LORD, Consider my groaning.
Psalms	Psa	19	5	2	Heed the sound of my cry for help, my King and my God, For to You I pray.
Psalms	Psa	19	5	3	In the morning, O LORD, You will hear my voice; In the morning I will order my prayer to You and eagerly watch.
Psalms	Psa	19	5	4	For You are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness; No evil dwells with You.
Psalms	Psa	19	5	5	The boastful shall not stand before Your eyes; You hate all who do iniquity.
Psalms	Psa	19	5	6	You destroy those who speak falsehood; The LORD abhors the man of bloodshed and deceit.
Psalms	Psa	19	5	7	But as for me, by Your abundant lovingkindness I will enter Your house, At Your holy temple I will bow in reverence for You.
Psalms	Psa	19	5	8	O LORD, lead me in Your righteousness because of my foes; Make Your way straight before me.
Psalms	Psa	19	5	9	There is nothing reliable in what they say; Their inward part is destruction itself. Their throat is an open grave; They flatter with their tongue.
Psalms	Psa	19	5	10	Hold them guilty, O God; By their own devices let them fall! In the multitude of their transgressions thrust them out, For they are rebellious against You.
Psalms	Psa	19	5	11	But let all who take refuge in You be glad, Let them ever sing for joy; And may You shelter them, That those who love Your name may exult in You.
Psalms	Psa	19	5	12	For it is You who blesses the righteous man, O LORD, You surround him with favor as with a shield.
Psalms	Psa	19	6	1	O LORD, do not rebuke me in Your anger, Nor chasten me in Your wrath.
Psalms	Psa	19	6	2	Be gracious to me, O LORD, for I am pining away; Heal me, O LORD, for my bones are dismayed.
Psalms	Psa	19	6	3	And my soul is greatly dismayed; But You, O LORD--how long?
Psalms	Psa	19	6	4	Return, O LORD, rescue my soul; Save me because of Your lovingkindness.
Psalms	Psa	19	6	5	For there is no mention of You in death; In Sheol who will give You thanks?
Psalms	Psa	19	6	6	I am weary with my sighing; Every night I make my bed swim, I dissolve my couch with my tears.
Psalms	Psa	19	6	7	My eye has wasted away with grief; It has become old because of all my adversaries.
Psalms	Psa	19	6	8	Depart from me, all you who do iniquity, For the LORD has heard the voice of my weeping.
Psalms	Psa	19	6	9	The LORD has heard my supplication, The LORD receives my prayer.
Psalms	Psa	19	6	10	All my enemies will be ashamed and greatly dismayed; They shall turn back, they will suddenly be ashamed.
Psalms	Psa	19	7	1	O LORD my God, in You I have taken refuge; Save me from all those who pursue me, and deliver me,
Psalms	Psa	19	7	2	Or he will tear my soul like a lion, Dragging me away, while there is none to deliver.
Psalms	Psa	19	7	3	O LORD my God, if I have done this, If there is injustice in my hands,
Psalms	Psa	19	7	4	If I have rewarded evil to my friend, Or have plundered him who without cause was my adversary,
Psalms	Psa	19	7	5	Let the enemy pursue my soul and overtake it; And let him trample my life down to the ground And lay my glory in the dust. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	7	6	Arise, O LORD, in Your anger; Lift up Yourself against the rage of my adversaries, And arouse Yourself for me; You have appointed judgment.
Psalms	Psa	19	7	7	Let the assembly of the peoples encompass You, And over them return on high.
Psalms	Psa	19	7	8	The LORD judges the peoples; Vindicate me, O LORD, according to my righteousness and my integrity that is in me.
Psalms	Psa	19	7	9	O let the evil of the wicked come to an end, but establish the righteous; For the righteous God tries the hearts and minds.
Psalms	Psa	19	7	10	My shield is with God, Who saves the upright in heart.
Psalms	Psa	19	7	11	God is a righteous judge, And a God who has indignation every day.
Psalms	Psa	19	7	12	If a man does not repent, He will sharpen His sword; He has bent His bow and made it ready.
Psalms	Psa	19	7	13	He has also prepared for Himself deadly weapons; He makes His arrows fiery shafts.
Psalms	Psa	19	7	14	Behold, he travails with wickedness, And he conceives mischief and brings forth falsehood.
Psalms	Psa	19	7	15	He has dug a pit and hollowed it out, And has fallen into the hole which he made.
Psalms	Psa	19	7	16	His mischief will return upon his own head, And his violence will descend upon his own pate.
Psalms	Psa	19	7	17	I will give thanks to the LORD according to His righteousness And will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High.
Psalms	Psa	19	8	1	O LORD, our Lord, How majestic is Your name in all the earth, Who have displayed Your splendor above the heavens!
Psalms	Psa	19	8	2	From the mouth of infants and nursing babes You have established strength Because of Your adversaries, To make the enemy and the revengeful cease.
Psalms	Psa	19	8	3	When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, The moon and the stars, which You have ordained;
Psalms	Psa	19	8	4	What is man that You take thought of him, And the son of man that You care for him?
Psalms	Psa	19	8	5	Yet You have made him a little lower than God, And You crown him with glory and majesty!
Psalms	Psa	19	8	6	You make him to rule over the works of Your hands; You have put all things under his feet,
Psalms	Psa	19	8	7	All sheep and oxen, And also the beasts of the field,
Psalms	Psa	19	8	8	The birds of the heavens and the fish of the sea, Whatever passes through the paths of the seas.
Psalms	Psa	19	8	9	O LORD, our Lord, How majestic is Your name in all the earth!
Psalms	Psa	19	9	1	I will give thanks to the LORD with all my heart; I will tell of all Your wonders.
Psalms	Psa	19	9	2	I will be glad and exult in You; I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.
Psalms	Psa	19	9	3	When my enemies turn back, They stumble and perish before You.
Psalms	Psa	19	9	4	For You have maintained my just cause; You have sat on the throne judging righteously.
Psalms	Psa	19	9	5	You have rebuked the nations, You have destroyed the wicked; You have blotted out their name forever and ever.
Psalms	Psa	19	9	6	The enemy has come to an end in perpetual ruins, And You have uprooted the cities; The very memory of them has perished.
Psalms	Psa	19	9	7	But the LORD abides forever; He has established His throne for judgment,
Psalms	Psa	19	9	8	And He will judge the world in righteousness; He will execute judgment for the peoples with equity.
Psalms	Psa	19	9	9	The LORD also will be a stronghold for the oppressed, A stronghold in times of trouble;
Psalms	Psa	19	9	10	And those who know Your name will put their trust in You, For You, O LORD, have not forsaken those who seek You.
Psalms	Psa	19	9	11	Sing praises to the LORD, who dwells in Zion; Declare among the peoples His deeds.
Psalms	Psa	19	9	12	For He who requires blood remembers them; He does not forget the cry of the afflicted.
Psalms	Psa	19	9	13	Be gracious to me, O LORD; See my affliction from those who hate me, You who lift me up from the gates of death,
Psalms	Psa	19	9	14	That I may tell of all Your praises, That in the gates of the daughter of Zion I may rejoice in Your salvation.
Psalms	Psa	19	9	15	The nations have sunk down in the pit which they have made; In the net which they hid, their own foot has been caught.
Psalms	Psa	19	9	16	The LORD has made Himself known; He has executed judgment. In the work of his own hands the wicked is snared. Higgaion Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	9	17	The wicked will return to Sheol, Even all the nations who forget God.
Psalms	Psa	19	9	18	For the needy will not always be forgotten, Nor the hope of the afflicted perish forever.
Psalms	Psa	19	9	19	Arise, O LORD, do not let man prevail; Let the nations be judged before You.
Psalms	Psa	19	9	20	Put them in fear, O LORD; Let the nations know that they are but men. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	10	1	Why do You stand afar off, O LORD? Why do You hide Yourself in times of trouble?
Psalms	Psa	19	10	2	In pride the wicked hotly pursue the afflicted; Let them be caught in the plots which they have devised.
Psalms	Psa	19	10	3	For the wicked boasts of his heart's desire, And the greedy man curses and spurns the LORD.
Psalms	Psa	19	10	4	The wicked, in the haughtiness of his countenance, does not seek Him. All his thoughts are, "There is no God."
Psalms	Psa	19	10	5	His ways prosper at all times; Your judgments are on high, out of his sight; As for all his adversaries, he snorts at them.
Psalms	Psa	19	10	6	He says to himself, "I will not be moved; Throughout all generations I will not be in adversity."
Psalms	Psa	19	10	7	His mouth is full of curses and deceit and oppression; Under his tongue is mischief and wickedness.
Psalms	Psa	19	10	8	He sits in the lurking places of the villages; In the hiding places he kills the innocent; His eyes stealthily watch for the unfortunate.
Psalms	Psa	19	10	9	He lurks in a hiding place as a lion in his lair; He lurks to catch the afflicted; He catches the afflicted when he draws him into his net.
Psalms	Psa	19	10	10	He crouches, he bows down, And the unfortunate fall by his mighty ones.
Psalms	Psa	19	10	11	He says to himself, "God has forgotten; He has hidden His face; He will never see it."
Psalms	Psa	19	10	12	Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up Your hand. Do not forget the afflicted.
Psalms	Psa	19	10	13	Why has the wicked spurned God? He has said to himself, "You will not require it."
Psalms	Psa	19	10	14	You have seen it, for You have beheld mischief and vexation to take it into Your hand. The unfortunate commits himself to You; You have been the helper of the orphan.
Psalms	Psa	19	10	15	Break the arm of the wicked and the evildoer, Seek out his wickedness until You find none.
Psalms	Psa	19	10	16	The LORD is King forever and ever; Nations have perished from His land.
Psalms	Psa	19	10	17	O LORD, You have heard the desire of the humble; You will strengthen their heart, You will incline Your ear
Psalms	Psa	19	10	18	To vindicate the orphan and the oppressed, So that man who is of the earth will no longer cause terror.
Psalms	Psa	19	11	1	In the LORD I take refuge; How can you say to my soul, "Flee as a bird to your mountain;
Psalms	Psa	19	11	2	For, behold, the wicked bend the bow, They make ready their arrow upon the string To shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.
Psalms	Psa	19	11	3	If the foundations are destroyed, What can the righteous do?"
Psalms	Psa	19	11	4	The LORD is in His holy temple; the LORD'S throne is in heaven; His eyes behold, His eyelids test the sons of men.
Psalms	Psa	19	11	5	The LORD tests the righteous and the wicked, And the one who loves violence His soul hates.
Psalms	Psa	19	11	6	Upon the wicked He will rain snares; Fire and brimstone and burning wind will be the portion of their cup.
Psalms	Psa	19	11	7	For the LORD is righteous, He loves righteousness; The upright will behold His face.
Psalms	Psa	19	12	1	Help, LORD, for the godly man ceases to be, For the faithful disappear from among the sons of men.
Psalms	Psa	19	12	2	They speak falsehood to one another; With flattering lips and with a double heart they speak.
Psalms	Psa	19	12	3	May the LORD cut off all flattering lips, The tongue that speaks great things;
Psalms	Psa	19	12	4	Who have said, "With our tongue we will prevail; Our lips are our own; who is lord over us?"
Psalms	Psa	19	12	5	"Because of the devastation of the afflicted, because of the groaning of the needy, Now I will arise," says the LORD; "I will set him in the safety for which he longs."
Psalms	Psa	19	12	6	The words of the LORD are pure words; As silver tried in a furnace on the earth, refined seven times.
Psalms	Psa	19	12	7	You, O LORD, will keep them; You will preserve him from this generation forever.
Psalms	Psa	19	12	8	The wicked strut about on every side When vileness is exalted among the sons of men.
Psalms	Psa	19	13	1	How long, O LORD? Will You forget me forever? How long will You hide Your face from me?
Psalms	Psa	19	13	2	How long shall I take counsel in my soul, Having sorrow in my heart all the day? How long will my enemy be exalted over me?
Psalms	Psa	19	13	3	Consider and answer me, O LORD my God; Enlighten my eyes, or I will sleep the sleep of death,
Psalms	Psa	19	13	4	And my enemy will say, "I have overcome him," And my adversaries will rejoice when I am shaken.
Psalms	Psa	19	13	5	But I have trusted in Your lovingkindness; My heart shall rejoice in Your salvation.
Psalms	Psa	19	13	6	I will sing to the LORD, Because He has dealt bountifully with me.
Psalms	Psa	19	14	1	The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt, they have committed abominable deeds; There is no one who does good.
Psalms	Psa	19	14	2	The LORD has looked down from heaven upon the sons of men To see if there are any who understand, Who seek after God.
Psalms	Psa	19	14	3	They have all turned aside, together they have become corrupt; There is no one who does good, not even one.
Psalms	Psa	19	14	4	Do all the workers of wickedness not know, Who eat up my people as they eat bread, And do not call upon the Lord?
Psalms	Psa	19	14	5	There they are in great dread, For God is with the righteous generation.
Psalms	Psa	19	14	6	You would put to shame the counsel of the afflicted, But the LORD is his refuge.
Psalms	Psa	19	14	7	Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! When the LORD restores His captive people, Jacob will rejoice, Israel will be glad.
Psalms	Psa	19	15	1	O LORD, who may abide in Your tent? Who may dwell on Your holy hill?
Psalms	Psa	19	15	2	He who walks with integrity, and works righteousness, And speaks truth in his heart.
Psalms	Psa	19	15	3	He does not slander with his tongue, Nor does evil to his neighbor, Nor takes up a reproach against his friend;
Psalms	Psa	19	15	4	In whose eyes a reprobate is despised, But who honors those who fear the LORD; He swears to his own hurt and does not change;
Psalms	Psa	19	15	5	He does not put out his money at interest, Nor does he take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things will never be shaken.
Psalms	Psa	19	16	1	Preserve me, O God, for I take refuge in You.
Psalms	Psa	19	16	2	I said to the LORD, "You are my Lord; I have no good besides You."
Psalms	Psa	19	16	3	As for the saints who are in the earth, They are the majestic ones in whom is all my delight.
Psalms	Psa	19	16	4	The sorrows of those who have bartered for another god will be multiplied; I shall not pour out their drink offerings of blood, Nor will I take their names upon my lips.
Psalms	Psa	19	16	5	The LORD is the portion of my inheritance and my cup; You support my lot.
Psalms	Psa	19	16	6	The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places; Indeed, my heritage is beautiful to me.
Psalms	Psa	19	16	7	I will bless the LORD who has counseled me; Indeed, my mind instructs me in the night.
Psalms	Psa	19	16	8	I have set the LORD continually before me; Because He is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.
Psalms	Psa	19	16	9	Therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoices; My flesh also will dwell securely.
Psalms	Psa	19	16	10	For You will not abandon my soul to Sheol; Nor will You allow Your Holy One to undergo decay.
Psalms	Psa	19	16	11	You will make known to me the path of life; In Your presence is fullness of joy; In Your right hand there are pleasures forever.
Psalms	Psa	19	17	1	Hear a just cause, O LORD, give heed to my cry; Give ear to my prayer, which is not from deceitful lips.
Psalms	Psa	19	17	2	Let my judgment come forth from Your presence; Let Your eyes look with equity.
Psalms	Psa	19	17	3	You have tried my heart; You have visited me by night; You have tested me and You find nothing; I have purposed that my mouth will not transgress.
Psalms	Psa	19	17	4	As for the deeds of men, by the word of Your lips I have kept from the paths of the violent.
Psalms	Psa	19	17	5	My steps have held fast to Your paths. My feet have not slipped.
Psalms	Psa	19	17	6	I have called upon You, for You will answer me, O God; Incline Your ear to me, hear my speech.
Psalms	Psa	19	17	7	Wondrously show Your lovingkindness, O Savior of those who take refuge at Your right hand From those who rise up against them.
Psalms	Psa	19	17	8	Keep me as the apple of the eye; Hide me in the shadow of Your wings
Psalms	Psa	19	17	9	From the wicked who despoil me, My deadly enemies who surround me.
Psalms	Psa	19	17	10	They have closed their unfeeling heart, With their mouth they speak proudly.
Psalms	Psa	19	17	11	They have now surrounded us in our steps; They set their eyes to cast us down to the ground.
Psalms	Psa	19	17	12	He is like a lion that is eager to tear, And as a young lion lurking in hiding places.
Psalms	Psa	19	17	13	Arise, O LORD, confront him, bring him low; Deliver my soul from the wicked with Your sword,
Psalms	Psa	19	17	14	From men with Your hand, O LORD, From men of the world, whose portion is in this life, And whose belly You fill with Your treasure; They are satisfied with children, And leave their abundance to their babes.
Psalms	Psa	19	17	15	As for me, I shall behold Your face in righteousness; I will be satisfied with Your likeness when I awake.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	1	"I love You, O LORD, my strength."
Psalms	Psa	19	18	2	The LORD is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge; My shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	3	I call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised, And I am saved from my enemies.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	4	The cords of death encompassed me, And the torrents of ungodliness terrified me.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	5	The cords of Sheol surrounded me; The snares of death confronted me.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	6	In my distress I called upon the LORD, And cried to my God for help; He heard my voice out of His temple, And my cry for help before Him came into His ears.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	7	Then the earth shook and quaked; And the foundations of the mountains were trembling And were shaken, because He was angry.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	8	Smoke went up out of His nostrils, And fire from His mouth devoured; Coals were kindled by it.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	9	He bowed the heavens also, and came down With thick darkness under His feet.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	10	He rode upon a cherub and flew; And He sped upon the wings of the wind.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	11	He made darkness His hiding place, His canopy around Him, Darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	12	From the brightness before Him passed His thick clouds, Hailstones and coals of fire.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	13	The LORD also thundered in the heavens, And the Most High uttered His voice, Hailstones and coals of fire.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	14	He sent out His arrows, and scattered them, And lightning flashes in abundance, and routed them.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	15	Then the channels of water appeared, And the foundations of the world were laid bare At Your rebuke, O LORD, At the blast of the breath of Your nostrils.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	16	He sent from on high, He took me; He drew me out of many waters.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	17	He delivered me from my strong enemy, And from those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	18	They confronted me in the day of my calamity, But the LORD was my stay.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	19	He brought me forth also into a broad place; He rescued me, because He delighted in me.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	20	The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands He has recompensed me.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	21	For I have kept the ways of the LORD, And have not wickedly departed from my God.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	22	For all His ordinances were before me, And I did not put away His statutes from me.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	23	I was also blameless with Him, And I kept myself from my iniquity.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	24	Therefore the LORD has recompensed me according to my righteousness, According to the cleanness of my hands in His eyes.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	25	With the kind You show Yourself kind; With the blameless You show Yourself blameless;
Psalms	Psa	19	18	26	With the pure You show Yourself pure, And with the crooked You show Yourself astute.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	27	For You save an afflicted people, But haughty eyes You abase.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	28	For You light my lamp; The LORD my God illumines my darkness.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	29	For by You I can run upon a troop; And by my God I can leap over a wall.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	30	As for God, His way is blameless; The word of the LORD is tried; He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	31	For who is God, but the LORD? And who is a rock, except our God,
Psalms	Psa	19	18	32	The God who girds me with strength And makes my way blameless?
Psalms	Psa	19	18	33	He makes my feet like hinds' feet, And sets me upon my high places.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	34	He trains my hands for battle, So that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	35	You have also given me the shield of Your salvation, And Your right hand upholds me; And Your gentleness makes me great.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	36	You enlarge my steps under me, And my feet have not slipped.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	37	I pursued my enemies and overtook them, And I did not turn back until they were consumed.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	38	I shattered them, so that they were not able to rise; They fell under my feet.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	39	For You have girded me with strength for battle; You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	40	You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, And I destroyed those who hated me.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	41	They cried for help, but there was none to save, Even to the LORD, but He did not answer them.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	42	Then I beat them fine as the dust before the wind; I emptied them out as the mire of the streets.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	43	You have delivered me from the contentions of the people; You have placed me as head of the nations; A people whom I have not known serve me.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	44	As soon as they hear, they obey me; Foreigners submit to me.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	45	Foreigners fade away, And come trembling out of their fortresses.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	46	The LORD lives, and blessed be my rock; And exalted be the God of my salvation,
Psalms	Psa	19	18	47	The God who executes vengeance for me, And subdues peoples under me.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	48	He delivers me from my enemies; Surely You lift me above those who rise up against me; You rescue me from the violent man.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	49	Therefore I will give thanks to You among the nations, O LORD, And I will sing praises to Your name.
Psalms	Psa	19	18	50	He gives great deliverance to His king, And shows lovingkindness to His anointed, To David and his descendants forever.
Psalms	Psa	19	19	1	The heavens are telling of the glory of God; And their expanse is declaring the work of His hands.
Psalms	Psa	19	19	2	Day to day pours forth speech, And night to night reveals knowledge.
Psalms	Psa	19	19	3	There is no speech, nor are there words; Their voice is not heard.
Psalms	Psa	19	19	4	Their line has gone out through all the earth, And their utterances to the end of the world. In them He has placed a tent for the sun,
Psalms	Psa	19	19	5	Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber; It rejoices as a strong man to run his course.
Psalms	Psa	19	19	6	Its rising is from one end of the heavens, And its circuit to the other end of them; And there is nothing hidden from its heat.
Psalms	Psa	19	19	7	The law of the LORD is perfect, restoring the soul; The testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.
Psalms	Psa	19	19	8	The precepts of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart; The commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.
Psalms	Psa	19	19	9	The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring forever; The judgments of the LORD are true; they are righteous altogether.
Psalms	Psa	19	19	10	They are more desirable than gold, yes, than much fine gold; Sweeter also than honey and the drippings of the honeycomb.
Psalms	Psa	19	19	11	Moreover, by them Your servant is warned; In keeping them there is great reward.
Psalms	Psa	19	19	12	Who can discern his errors? Acquit me of hidden faults.
Psalms	Psa	19	19	13	Also keep back Your servant from presumptuous sins; Let them not rule over me; Then I will be blameless, And I shall be acquitted of great transgression.
Psalms	Psa	19	19	14	Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart Be acceptable in Your sight, O LORD, my rock and my Redeemer.
Psalms	Psa	19	20	1	May the LORD answer you in the day of trouble! May the name of the God of Jacob set you securely on high!
Psalms	Psa	19	20	2	May He send you help from the sanctuary And support you from Zion!
Psalms	Psa	19	20	3	May He remember all your meal offerings And find your burnt offering acceptable! Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	20	4	May He grant you your heart's desire And fulfill all your counsel!
Psalms	Psa	19	20	5	We will sing for joy over your victory, And in the name of our God we will set up our banners. May the LORD fulfill all your petitions.
Psalms	Psa	19	20	6	Now I know that the LORD saves His anointed; He will answer him from His holy heaven With the saving strength of His right hand.
Psalms	Psa	19	20	7	Some boast in chariots and some in horses, But we will boast in the name of the LORD, our God.
Psalms	Psa	19	20	8	They have bowed down and fallen, But we have risen and stood upright.
Psalms	Psa	19	20	9	Save, O LORD; May the King answer us in the day we call.
Psalms	Psa	19	21	1	O LORD, in Your strength the king will be glad, And in Your salvation how greatly he will rejoice!
Psalms	Psa	19	21	2	You have given him his heart's desire, And You have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	21	3	For You meet him with the blessings of good things; You set a crown of fine gold on his head.
Psalms	Psa	19	21	4	He asked life of You, You gave it to him, Length of days forever and ever.
Psalms	Psa	19	21	5	His glory is great through Your salvation, Splendor and majesty You place upon him.
Psalms	Psa	19	21	6	For You make him most blessed forever; You make him joyful with gladness in Your presence.
Psalms	Psa	19	21	7	For the king trusts in the LORD, And through the lovingkindness of the Most High he will not be shaken.
Psalms	Psa	19	21	8	Your hand will find out all your enemies; Your right hand will find out those who hate you.
Psalms	Psa	19	21	9	You will make them as a fiery oven in the time of your anger; The LORD will swallow them up in His wrath, And fire will devour them.
Psalms	Psa	19	21	10	Their offspring You will destroy from the earth, And their descendants from among the sons of men.
Psalms	Psa	19	21	11	Though they intended evil against You And devised a plot, They will not succeed.
Psalms	Psa	19	21	12	For You will make them turn their back; You will aim with Your bowstrings at their faces.
Psalms	Psa	19	21	13	Be exalted, O LORD, in Your strength; We will sing and praise Your power.
Psalms	Psa	19	22	1	My God, my God, why have You forsaken me? Far from my deliverance are the words of my groaning.
Psalms	Psa	19	22	2	O my God, I cry by day, but You do not answer; And by night, but I have no rest.
Psalms	Psa	19	22	3	Yet You are holy, O You who are enthroned upon the praises of Israel.
Psalms	Psa	19	22	4	In You our fathers trusted; They trusted and You delivered them.
Psalms	Psa	19	22	5	To You they cried out and were delivered; In You they trusted and were not disappointed.
Psalms	Psa	19	22	6	But I am a worm and not a man, A reproach of men and despised by the people.
Psalms	Psa	19	22	7	All who see me sneer at me; They separate with the lip, they wag the head, saying,
Psalms	Psa	19	22	8	"Commit yourself to the LORD; let Him deliver him; Let Him rescue him, because He delights in him."
Psalms	Psa	19	22	9	Yet You are He who brought me forth from the womb; You made me trust when upon my mother's breasts.
Psalms	Psa	19	22	10	Upon You I was cast from birth; You have been my God from my mother's womb.
Psalms	Psa	19	22	11	Be not far from me, for trouble is near; For there is none to help.
Psalms	Psa	19	22	12	Many bulls have surrounded me; Strong bulls of Bashan have encircled me.
Psalms	Psa	19	22	13	They open wide their mouth at me, As a ravening and a roaring lion.
Psalms	Psa	19	22	14	I am poured out like water, And all my bones are out of joint; My heart is like wax; It is melted within me.
Psalms	Psa	19	22	15	My strength is dried up like a potsherd, And my tongue cleaves to my jaws; And You lay me in the dust of death.
Psalms	Psa	19	22	16	For dogs have surrounded me; A band of evildoers has encompassed me; They pierced my hands and my feet.
Psalms	Psa	19	22	17	I can count all my bones. They look, they stare at me;
Psalms	Psa	19	22	18	They divide my garments among them, And for my clothing they cast lots.
Psalms	Psa	19	22	19	But You, O LORD, be not far off; O You my help, hasten to my assistance.
Psalms	Psa	19	22	20	Deliver my soul from the sword, My only life from the power of the dog.
Psalms	Psa	19	22	21	Save me from the lion's mouth; From the horns of the wild oxen You answer me.
Psalms	Psa	19	22	22	I will tell of Your name to my brethren; In the midst of the assembly I will praise You.

Psalms	Psa	19	30	5	For His anger is but for a moment, His favor is for a lifetime; Weeping may last for the night, But a shout of joy comes in the morning.
Psalms	Psa	19	30	6	Now as for me, I said in my prosperity, "I will never be moved."
Psalms	Psa	19	30	7	O LORD, by Your favor You have made my mountain to stand strong; You hid Your face, I was dismayed.
Psalms	Psa	19	30	8	To You, O LORD, I called, And to the Lord I made supplication:
Psalms	Psa	19	30	9	"What profit is there in my blood, if I go down to the pit? Will the dust praise You? Will it declare Your faithfulness?
Psalms	Psa	19	30	10	"Hear, O LORD, and be gracious to me; O LORD, be my helper."
Psalms	Psa	19	30	11	You have turned for me my mourning into dancing; You have loosed my sackcloth and girded me with gladness,

Psalms	Psa	19	31	8	And You have not given me over into the hand of the enemy; You have set my feet in a large place.
Psalms	Psa	19	31	9	Be gracious to me, O LORD, for I am in distress; My eye is wasted away from grief, my soul and my body also.
Psalms	Psa	19	31	10	For my life is spent with sorrow And my years with sighing; My strength has failed because of my iniquity, And my body has wasted away.
Psalms	Psa	19	31	11	Because of all my adversaries, I have become a reproach, Especially to my neighbors, And an object of dread to my acquaintances; Those who see me in the street flee from me.
Psalms	Psa	19	31	12	I am forgotten as a dead man, out of mind; I am like a broken vessel.
Psalms	Psa	19	31	13	For I have heard the slander of many, Terror is on every side; While they took counsel together against me, They schemed to take away my life.

Psalms	Psa	19	31	19	How great is Your goodness, Which You have stored up for those who fear You, Which You have wrought for those who take refuge in You, Before the sons of men!
Psalms	Psa	19	31	20	You hide them in the secret place of Your presence from the conspiracies of man; You keep them secretly in a shelter from the strife of tongues.
Psalms	Psa	19	31	21	Blessed be the LORD, For He has made marvelous His lovingkindness to me in a besieged city.
Psalms	Psa	19	31	22	As for me, I said in my alarm, "I am cut off from before Your eyes"; Nevertheless You heard the voice of my supplications When I cried to You.
Psalms	Psa	19	31	23	O love the LORD, all you His godly ones! The LORD preserves the faithful And fully recompenses the proud doer.
Psalms	Psa	19	31	24	Be strong and let your heart take courage, All you who hope in the LORD.
Psalms	Psa	19	32	1	How blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, Whose sin is covered!
Psalms	Psa	19	32	2	How blessed is the man to whom the LORD does not impute iniquity, And in whose spirit there is no deceit!
Psalms	Psa	19	32	3	When I kept silent about my sin, my body wasted away Through my groaning all day long.
Psalms	Psa	19	32	4	For day and night Your hand was heavy upon me; My vitality was drained away as with the fever heat of summer. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	32	5	I acknowledged my sin to You, And my iniquity I did not hide; I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the LORD"; And You forgave the guilt of my sin. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	32	6	Therefore, let everyone who is godly pray to You in a time when You may be found; Surely in a flood of great waters they will not reach him.
Psalms	Psa	19	32	7	You are my hiding place; You preserve me from trouble; You surround me with songs of deliverance. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	32	8	I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you should go; I will counsel you with My eye upon you.
Psalms	Psa	19	32	9	Do not be as the horse or as the mule which have no understanding, Whose trappings include bit and bridle to hold them in check, Otherwise they will not come near to you.
Psalms	Psa	19	32	10	Many are the sorrows of the wicked, But he who trusts in the LORD, lovingkindness shall surround him.
Psalms	Psa	19	32	11	Be glad in the LORD and rejoice, you righteous ones; And shout for joy, all you who are upright in heart.
Psalms	Psa	19	33	1	Sing for joy in the LORD, O you righteous ones; Praise is becoming to the upright.
Psalms	Psa	19	33	2	Give thanks to the LORD with the lyre; Sing praises to Him with a harp of ten strings.

Psalms	Psa	19	33	12	Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD, The people whom He has chosen for His own inheritance.
Psalms	Psa	19	33	13	The LORD looks from heaven; He sees all the sons of men;
Psalms	Psa	19	33	14	From His dwelling place He looks out On all the inhabitants of the earth,
Psalms	Psa	19	33	15	He who fashions the hearts of them all, He who understands all their works.
Psalms	Psa	19	33	16	The king is not saved by a mighty army; A warrior is not delivered by great strength.
Psalms	Psa	19	33	17	A horse is a false hope for victory; Nor does it deliver anyone by its great strength.
Psalms	Psa	19	33	18	Behold, the eye of the LORD is on those who fear Him, On those who hope for His lovingkindness,

Psalms	Psa	19	35	11	Malicious witnesses rise up; They ask me of things that I do not know.
Psalms	Psa	19	35	12	They repay me evil for good, To the bereavement of my soul.
Psalms	Psa	19	35	13	But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth; I humbled my soul with fasting, And my prayer kept returning to my bosom.
Psalms	Psa	19	35	14	I went about as though it were my friend or brother; I bowed down mourning, as one who sorrows for a mother.
Psalms	Psa	19	35	15	But at my stumbling they rejoiced and gathered themselves together; The smiters whom I did not know gathered together against me, They slandered me without ceasing.
Psalms	Psa	19	35	16	Like godless jesters at a feast, They gnashed at me with their teeth.
Psalms	Psa	19	35	17	Lord, how long will You look on? Rescue my soul from their ravages, My only life from the lions.

Psalms	Psa	19	35	26	Let those be ashamed and humiliated altogether who rejoice at my distress; Let those be clothed with shame and dishonor who magnify themselves over me.
Psalms	Psa	19	35	27	Let them shout for joy and rejoice, who favor my vindication; And let them say continually, "The LORD be magnified, Who delights in the prosperity of His servant."
Psalms	Psa	19	35	28	And my tongue shall declare Your righteousness And Your praise all day long.
Psalms	Psa	19	36	1	Transgression speaks to the ungodly within his heart; There is no fear of God before his eyes.
Psalms	Psa	19	36	2	For it flatters him in his own eyes Concerning the discovery of his iniquity and the hatred of it.
Psalms	Psa	19	36	3	The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit; He has ceased to be wise and to do good.
Psalms	Psa	19	36	4	He plans wickedness upon his bed; He sets himself on a path that is not good; He does not despise evil.

Psalms	Psa	19	38	8	I am benumbed and badly crushed; I groan because of the agitation of my heart.
Psalms	Psa	19	38	9	Lord, all my desire is before You; And my sighing is not hidden from You.

Psalms	Psa	19	39	2	I was mute and silent, I refrained even from good, And my sorrow grew worse.
Psalms	Psa	19	39	3	My heart was hot within me, While I was musing the fire burned; Then I spoke with my tongue:
Psalms	Psa	19	39	4	"LORD, make me to know my end And what is the extent of my days; Let me know how transient I am.
Psalms	Psa	19	39	5	"Behold, You have made my days as handbreadths, And my lifetime as nothing in Your sight; Surely every man at his best is a mere breath. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	39	6	"Surely every man walks about as a phantom; Surely they make an uproar for nothing; He amasses riches and does not know who will gather them.

Psalms	Psa	19	39	13	"Turn Your gaze away from me, that I may smile again Before I depart and am no more."
Psalms	Psa	19	40	1	I waited patiently for the LORD; And He inclined to me and heard my cry.
Psalms	Psa	19	40	2	He brought me up out of the pit of destruction, out of the miry clay, And He set my feet upon a rock making my footsteps firm.
Psalms	Psa	19	40	3	He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God; Many will see and fear And will trust in the LORD.
Psalms	Psa	19	40	4	How blessed is the man who has made the LORD his trust, And has not turned to the proud, nor to those who lapse into falsehood.
Psalms	Psa	19	40	5	Many, O LORD my God, are the wonders which You have done, And Your thoughts toward us; There is none to compare with You. If I would declare and speak of them, They would be too numerous to count.
Psalms	Psa	19	40	6	Sacrifice and meal offering You have not desired; My ears You have opened; Burnt offering and sin offering You have not required.
Psalms	Psa	19	40	7	Then I said, "Behold, I come; In the scroll of the book it is written of me.
Psalms	Psa	19	40	8	I delight to do Your will, O my God; Your Law is within my heart."

Psalms	Psa	19	40	11	You, O LORD, will not withhold Your compassion from me; Your lovingkindness and Your truth will continually preserve me.
Psalms	Psa	19	40	12	For evils beyond number have surrounded me; My iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to see; They are more numerous than the hairs of my head, And my heart has failed me.
Psalms	Psa	19	40	13	Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me; Make haste, O LORD, to help me.
Psalms	Psa	19	40	14	Let those be ashamed and humiliated together Who seek my life to destroy it; Let those be turned back and dishonored Who delight in my hurt.
Psalms	Psa	19	40	15	Let those be appalled because of their shame Who say to me, "Aha, aha!"
Psalms	Psa	19	40	16	Let all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; Let those who love Your salvation say continually, "The LORD be magnified!"

Psalms	Psa	19	41	4	As for me, I said, "O LORD, be gracious to me; Heal my soul, for I have sinned against You."
Psalms	Psa	19	41	5	My enemies speak evil against me, "When will he die, and his name perish?"
Psalms	Psa	19	41	6	And when he comes to see me, he speaks falsehood; His heart gathers wickedness to itself; When he goes outside, he tells it.
Psalms	Psa	19	41	7	All who hate me whisper together against me; Against me they devise my hurt, saying,
Psalms	Psa	19	41	8	"A wicked thing is poured out upon him, That when he lies down, he will not rise up again."
Psalms	Psa	19	41	9	Even my close friend in whom I trusted, Who ate my bread, Has lifted up his heel against me.
Psalms	Psa	19	41	10	But You, O LORD, be gracious to me and raise me up, That I may repay them.
Psalms	Psa	19	41	11	By this I know that You are pleased with me, Because my enemy does not shout in triumph over me.
Psalms	Psa	19	41	12	As for me, You uphold me in my integrity, And You set me in Your presence forever.

Psalms	Psa	19	42	6	O my God, my soul is in despair within me; Therefore I remember You from the land of the Jordan And the peaks of Hermon, from Mount Mizar.
Psalms	Psa	19	42	7	Deep calls to deep at the sound of Your waterfalls; All Your breakers and Your waves have rolled over me.
Psalms	Psa	19	42	8	The LORD will command His lovingkindness in the daytime; And His song will be with me in the night, A prayer to the God of my life.
Psalms	Psa	19	42	9	I will say to God my rock, "Why have You forgotten me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?"
Psalms	Psa	19	42	10	As a shattering of my bones, my adversaries revile me, While they say to me all day long, "Where is your God?"
Psalms	Psa	19	42	11	Why are you in despair, O my soul? And why have you become disturbed within me? Hope in God, for I shall yet praise Him, The help of my countenance and my God.
Psalms	Psa	19	43	1	Vindicate me, O God, and plead my case against an ungodly nation; O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man!
Psalms	Psa	19	43	2	For You are the God of my strength; why have You rejected me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
Psalms	Psa	19	43	3	O send out Your light and Your truth, let them lead me; Let them bring me to Your holy hill And to Your dwelling places.
Psalms	Psa	19	43	4	Then I will go to the altar of God, To God my exceeding joy; And upon the lyre I shall praise You, O God, my God.
Psalms	Psa	19	43	5	Why are you in despair, O my soul? And why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God, for I shall again praise Him, The help of my countenance and my God.
Psalms	Psa	19	44	1	O God, we have heard with our ears, Our fathers have told us The work that You did in their days, In the days of old.
Psalms	Psa	19	44	2	You with Your own hand drove out the nations; Then You planted them; You afflicted the peoples, Then You spread them abroad.

Psalms	Psa	19	44	11	You give us as sheep to be eaten And have scattered us among the nations.
Psalms	Psa	19	44	12	You sell Your people cheaply, And have not profited by their sale.
Psalms	Psa	19	44	13	You make us a reproach to our neighbors, A scoffing and a derision to those around us.
Psalms	Psa	19	44	14	You make us a byword among the nations, A laughingstock among the peoples.
Psalms	Psa	19	44	15	All day long my dishonor is before me And my humiliation has overwhelmed me,
Psalms	Psa	19	44	16	Because of the voice of him who reproaches and reviles, Because of the presence of the enemy and the avenger.

Psalms	Psa	19	49	13	This is the way of those who are foolish, And of those after them who approve their words. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	49	14	As sheep they are appointed for Sheol; Death shall be their shepherd; And the upright shall rule over them in the morning, And their form shall be for Sheol to consume So that they have no habitation.
Psalms	Psa	19	49	15	But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol, For He will receive me. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	49	16	Do not be afraid when a man becomes rich, When the glory of his house is increased;

Psalms	Psa	19	49	18	Though while he lives he congratulates himself-- And though men praise you when you do well for yourself--
Psalms	Psa	19	49	19	He shall go to the generation of his fathers; They will never see the light.

Psalms	Psa	19	50	3	May our God come and not keep silence; Fire devours before Him, And it is very tempestuous around Him.
Psalms	Psa	19	50	4	He summons the heavens above, And the earth, to judge His people:

Psalms	Psa	19	50	20	"You sit and speak against your brother; You slander your own mother's son.
Psalms	Psa	19	50	21	"These things you have done and I kept silence; You thought that I was just like you; I will reprove you and state the case in order before your eyes.
Psalms	Psa	19	50	22	"Now consider this, you who forget God, Or I will tear you in pieces, and there will be none to deliver.
Psalms	Psa	19	50	23	"He who offers a sacrifice of thanksgiving honors Me; And to him who orders his way aright I shall show the salvation of God."
Psalms	Psa	19	51	1	Be gracious to me, O God, according to Your lovingkindness; According to the greatness of Your compassion blot out my transgressions.
Psalms	Psa	19	51	2	Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity And cleanse me from my sin.
Psalms	Psa	19	51	3	For I know my transgressions, And my sin is ever before me.
Psalms	Psa	19	51	4	Against You, You only, I have sinned And done what is evil in Your sight, So that You are justified when You speak And blameless when You judge.
Psalms	Psa	19	51	5	Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, And in sin my mother conceived me.
Psalms	Psa	19	51	6	Behold, You desire truth in the innermost being, And in the hidden part You will make me know wisdom.

Psalms	Psa	19	51	15	O Lord, open my lips, That my mouth may declare Your praise.
Psalms	Psa	19	51	16	For You do not delight in sacrifice, otherwise I would give it; You are not pleased with burnt offering.

Psalms	Psa	19	51	18	By Your favor do good to Zion; Build the walls of Jerusalem.

Psalms	Psa	19	52	1	Why do you boast in evil, O mighty man? The lovingkindness of God endures all day long.
Psalms	Psa	19	52	2	Your tongue devises destruction, Like a sharp razor, O worker of deceit.
Psalms	Psa	19	52	3	You love evil more than good, Falsehood more than speaking what is right. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	52	4	You love all words that devour, O deceitful tongue.
Psalms	Psa	19	52	5	But God will break you down forever; He will snatch you up and tear you away from your tent, And uproot you from the land of the living. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	52	6	The righteous will see and fear, And will laugh at him, saying,
Psalms	Psa	19	52	7	"Behold, the man who would not make God his refuge, But trusted in the abundance of his riches And was strong in his evil desire."

Psalms	Psa	19	52	9	I will give You thanks forever, because You have done it, And I will wait on Your name, for it is good, in the presence of Your godly ones.
Psalms	Psa	19	53	1	The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God," They are corrupt, and have committed abominable injustice; There is no one who does good.
Psalms	Psa	19	53	2	God has looked down from heaven upon the sons of men To see if there is anyone who understands, Who seeks after God.
Psalms	Psa	19	53	3	Every one of them has turned aside; together they have become corrupt; There is no one who does good, not even one.
Psalms	Psa	19	53	4	Have the workers of wickedness no knowledge, Who eat up My people as though they ate bread And have not called upon God?
Psalms	Psa	19	53	5	There they were in great fear where no fear had been; For God scattered the bones of him who encamped against you; You put them to shame, because God had rejected them.
Psalms	Psa	19	53	6	Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! When God restores His captive people, Let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad.
Psalms	Psa	19	54	1	Save me, O God, by Your name, And vindicate me by Your power.
Psalms	Psa	19	54	2	Hear my prayer, O God; Give ear to the words of my mouth.
Psalms	Psa	19	54	3	For strangers have risen against me And violent men have sought my life; They have not set God before them. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	54	4	Behold, God is my helper; The Lord is the sustainer of my soul.

Psalms	Psa	19	54	6	Willingly I will sacrifice to You; I will give thanks to Your name, O LORD, for it is good.
Psalms	Psa	19	54	7	For He has delivered me from all trouble, And my eye has looked with satisfaction upon my enemies.
Psalms	Psa	19	55	1	Give ear to my prayer, O God; And do not hide Yourself from my supplication.
Psalms	Psa	19	55	2	Give heed to me and answer me; I am restless in my complaint and am surely distracted,
Psalms	Psa	19	55	3	Because of the voice of the enemy, Because of the pressure of the wicked; For they bring down trouble upon me And in anger they bear a grudge against me.
Psalms	Psa	19	55	4	My heart is in anguish within me, And the terrors of death have fallen upon me.
Psalms	Psa	19	55	5	Fear and trembling come upon me, And horror has overwhelmed me.
Psalms	Psa	19	55	6	I said, "Oh, that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest.
Psalms	Psa	19	55	7	"Behold, I would wander far away, I would lodge in the wilderness. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	55	8	"I would hasten to my place of refuge From the stormy wind and tempest."
Psalms	Psa	19	55	9	Confuse, O Lord, divide their tongues, For I have seen violence and strife in the city.
Psalms	Psa	19	55	10	Day and night they go around her upon her walls, And iniquity and mischief are in her midst.
Psalms	Psa	19	55	11	Destruction is in her midst; Oppression and deceit do not depart from her streets.
Psalms	Psa	19	55	12	For it is not an enemy who reproaches me, Then I could bear it; Nor is it one who hates me who has exalted himself against me, Then I could hide myself from him.
Psalms	Psa	19	55	13	But it is you, a man my equal, My companion and my familiar friend;
Psalms	Psa	19	55	14	We who had sweet fellowship together Walked in the house of God in the throng.
Psalms	Psa	19	55	15	Let death come deceitfully upon them; Let them go down alive to Sheol, For evil is in their dwelling, in their midst.
Psalms	Psa	19	55	16	As for me, I shall call upon God, And the LORD will save me.
Psalms	Psa	19	55	17	Evening and morning and at noon, I will complain and murmur, And He will hear my voice.
Psalms	Psa	19	55	18	He will redeem my soul in peace from the battle which is against me, For they are many who strive with me.
Psalms	Psa	19	55	19	God will hear and answer them-- Even the one who sits enthroned from of old-- Selah. With whom there is no change, And who do not fear God.
Psalms	Psa	19	55	20	He has put forth his hands against those who were at peace with him; He has violated his covenant.
Psalms	Psa	19	55	21	His speech was smoother than butter, But his heart was war; His words were softer than oil, Yet they were drawn swords.
Psalms	Psa	19	55	22	Cast your burden upon the LORD and He will sustain you; He will never allow the righteous to be shaken.
Psalms	Psa	19	55	23	But You, O God, will bring them down to the pit of destruction; Men of bloodshed and deceit will not live out half their days. But I will trust in You.
Psalms	Psa	19	56	1	Be gracious to me, O God, for man has trampled upon me; Fighting all day long he oppresses me.
Psalms	Psa	19	56	2	My foes have trampled upon me all day long, For they are many who fight proudly against me.
Psalms	Psa	19	56	3	When I am afraid, I will put my trust in You.
Psalms	Psa	19	56	4	In God, whose word I praise, In God I have put my trust; I shall not be afraid. What can mere man do to me?
Psalms	Psa	19	56	5	All day long they distort my words; All their thoughts are against me for evil.
Psalms	Psa	19	56	6	They attack, they lurk, They watch my steps, As they have waited to take my life.
Psalms	Psa	19	56	7	Because of wickedness, cast them forth, In anger put down the peoples, O God!
Psalms	Psa	19	56	8	You have taken account of my wanderings; Put my tears in Your bottle. Are they not in Your book?
Psalms	Psa	19	56	9	Then my enemies will turn back in the day when I call; This I know, that God is for me.
Psalms	Psa	19	56	10	In God, whose word I praise, In the LORD, whose word I praise,
Psalms	Psa	19	56	11	In God I have put my trust, I shall not be afraid. What can man do to me?
Psalms	Psa	19	56	12	Your vows are binding upon me, O God; I will render thank offerings to You.
Psalms	Psa	19	56	13	For You have delivered my soul from death, Indeed my feet from stumbling, So that I may walk before God In the light of the living.
Psalms	Psa	19	57	1	Be gracious to me, O God, be gracious to me, For my soul takes refuge in You; And in the shadow of Your wings I will take refuge Until destruction passes by.
Psalms	Psa	19	57	2	I will cry to God Most High, To God who accomplishes all things for me.
Psalms	Psa	19	57	3	He will send from heaven and save me; He reproaches him who tramples upon me. Selah. God will send forth His lovingkindness and His truth.
Psalms	Psa	19	57	4	My soul is among lions; I must lie among those who breathe forth fire, Even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows And their tongue a sharp sword.
Psalms	Psa	19	57	5	Be exalted above the heavens, O God; Let Your glory be above all the earth.
Psalms	Psa	19	57	6	They have prepared a net for my steps; My soul is bowed down; They dug a pit before me; They themselves have fallen into the midst of it. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	57	7	My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast; I will sing, yes, I will sing praises!
Psalms	Psa	19	57	8	Awake, my glory! Awake, harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn.
Psalms	Psa	19	57	9	I will give thanks to You, O Lord, among the peoples; I will sing praises to You among the nations.
Psalms	Psa	19	57	10	For Your lovingkindness is great to the heavens And Your truth to the clouds.
Psalms	Psa	19	57	11	Be exalted above the heavens, O God; Let Your glory be above all the earth.
Psalms	Psa	19	58	1	Do you indeed speak righteousness, O gods? Do you judge uprightly, O sons of men?
Psalms	Psa	19	58	2	No, in heart you work unrighteousness; On earth you weigh out the violence of your hands.
Psalms	Psa	19	58	3	The wicked are estranged from the womb; These who speak lies go astray from birth.
Psalms	Psa	19	58	4	They have venom like the venom of a serpent; Like a deaf cobra that stops up its ear,
Psalms	Psa	19	58	5	So that it does not hear the voice of charmers, Or a skillful caster of spells.
Psalms	Psa	19	58	6	O God, shatter their teeth in their mouth; Break out the fangs of the young lions, O LORD.
Psalms	Psa	19	58	7	Let them flow away like water that runs off; When he aims his arrows, let them be as headless shafts.
Psalms	Psa	19	58	8	Let them be as a snail which melts away as it goes along, Like the miscarriages of a woman which never see the sun.
Psalms	Psa	19	58	9	Before your pots can feel the fire of thorns He will sweep them away with a whirlwind, the green and the burning alike.
Psalms	Psa	19	58	10	The righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance; He will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.
Psalms	Psa	19	58	11	And men will say, "Surely there is a reward for the righteous; Surely there is a God who judges on earth!"
Psalms	Psa	19	59	1	Deliver me from my enemies, O my God; Set me securely on high away from those who rise up against me.
Psalms	Psa	19	59	2	Deliver me from those who do iniquity And save me from men of bloodshed.
Psalms	Psa	19	59	3	For behold, they have set an ambush for my life; Fierce men launch an attack against me, Not for my transgression nor for my sin, O LORD,
Psalms	Psa	19	59	4	For no guilt of mine, they run and set themselves against me. Arouse Yourself to help me, and see!
Psalms	Psa	19	59	5	You, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, Awake to punish all the nations; Do not be gracious to any who are treacherous in iniquity. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	59	6	They return at evening, they howl like a dog, And go around the city.
Psalms	Psa	19	59	7	Behold, they belch forth with their mouth; Swords are in their lips, For, they say, "Who hears?"
Psalms	Psa	19	59	8	But You, O LORD, laugh at them; You scoff at all the nations.
Psalms	Psa	19	59	9	Because of his strength I will watch for You, For God is my stronghold.
Psalms	Psa	19	59	10	My God in His lovingkindness will meet me; God will let me look triumphantly upon my foes.
Psalms	Psa	19	59	11	Do not slay them, or my people will forget; Scatter them by Your power, and bring them down, O Lord, our shield.
Psalms	Psa	19	59	12	On account of the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips, Let them even be caught in their pride, And on account of curses and lies which they utter.
Psalms	Psa	19	59	13	Destroy them in wrath, destroy them that they may be no more; That men may know that God rules in Jacob To the ends of the earth. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	59	14	They return at evening, they howl like a dog, And go around the city.
Psalms	Psa	19	59	15	They wander about for food And growl if they are not satisfied.
Psalms	Psa	19	59	16	But as for me, I shall sing of Your strength; Yes, I shall joyfully sing of Your lovingkindness in the morning, For You have been my stronghold And a refuge in the day of my distress.
Psalms	Psa	19	59	17	O my strength, I will sing praises to You; For God is my stronghold, the God who shows me lovingkindness.
Psalms	Psa	19	60	1	O God, You have rejected us. You have broken us; You have been angry; O, restore us.
Psalms	Psa	19	60	2	You have made the land quake, You have split it open; Heal its breaches, for it totters.
Psalms	Psa	19	60	3	You have made Your people experience hardship; You have given us wine to drink that makes us stagger.
Psalms	Psa	19	60	4	You have given a banner to those who fear You, That it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	60	5	That Your beloved may be delivered, Save with Your right hand, and answer us!
Psalms	Psa	19	60	6	God has spoken in His holiness: "I will exult, I will portion out Shechem and measure out the valley of Succoth.
Psalms	Psa	19	60	7	"Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim also is the helmet of My head; Judah is My scepter.
Psalms	Psa	19	60	8	"Moab is My washbowl; Over Edom I shall throw My shoe; Shout loud, O Philistia, because of Me!"
Psalms	Psa	19	60	9	Who will bring me into the besieged city? Who will lead me to Edom?
Psalms	Psa	19	60	10	Have not You Yourself, O God, rejected us? And will You not go forth with our armies, O God?
Psalms	Psa	19	60	11	O give us help against the adversary, For deliverance by man is in vain.
Psalms	Psa	19	60	12	Through God we shall do valiantly, And it is He who will tread down our adversaries.
Psalms	Psa	19	61	1	Hear my cry, O God; Give heed to my prayer.
Psalms	Psa	19	61	2	From the end of the earth I call to You when my heart is faint; Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
Psalms	Psa	19	61	3	For You have been a refuge for me, A tower of strength against the enemy.
Psalms	Psa	19	61	4	Let me dwell in Your tent forever; Let me take refuge in the shelter of Your wings. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	61	5	For You have heard my vows, O God; You have given me the inheritance of those who fear Your name.
Psalms	Psa	19	61	6	You will prolong the king's life; His years will be as many generations.
Psalms	Psa	19	61	7	He will abide before God forever; Appoint lovingkindness and truth that they may preserve him.
Psalms	Psa	19	61	8	So I will sing praise to Your name forever, That I may pay my vows day by day.
Psalms	Psa	19	62	1	My soul waits in silence for God only; From Him is my salvation.
Psalms	Psa	19	62	2	He only is my rock and my salvation, My stronghold; I shall not be greatly shaken.
Psalms	Psa	19	62	3	How long will you assail a man, That you may murder him, all of you, Like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence?
Psalms	Psa	19	62	4	They have counseled only to thrust him down from his high position; They delight in falsehood; They bless with their mouth, But inwardly they curse. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	62	5	My soul, wait in silence for God only, For my hope is from Him.
Psalms	Psa	19	62	6	He only is my rock and my salvation, My stronghold; I shall not be shaken.
Psalms	Psa	19	62	7	On God my salvation and my glory rest; The rock of my strength, my refuge is in God.
Psalms	Psa	19	62	8	Trust in Him at all times, O people; Pour out your heart before Him; God is a refuge for us. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	62	9	Men of low degree are only vanity and men of rank are a lie; In the balances they go up; They are together lighter than breath.
Psalms	Psa	19	62	10	Do not trust in oppression And do not vainly hope in robbery; If riches increase, do not set your heart upon them.
Psalms	Psa	19	62	11	Once God has spoken; Twice I have heard this: That power belongs to God;
Psalms	Psa	19	62	12	And lovingkindness is Yours, O Lord, For You recompense a man according to his work.
Psalms	Psa	19	63	1	O God, You are my God; I shall seek You earnestly; My soul thirsts for You, my flesh yearns for You, In a dry and weary land where there is no water.
Psalms	Psa	19	63	2	Thus I have seen You in the sanctuary, To see Your power and Your glory.
Psalms	Psa	19	63	3	Because Your lovingkindness is better than life, My lips will praise You.
Psalms	Psa	19	63	4	So I will bless You as long as I live; I will lift up my hands in Your name.
Psalms	Psa	19	63	5	My soul is satisfied as with marrow and fatness, And my mouth offers praises with joyful lips.
Psalms	Psa	19	63	6	When I remember You on my bed, I meditate on You in the night watches,
Psalms	Psa	19	63	7	For You have been my help, And in the shadow of Your wings I sing for joy.
Psalms	Psa	19	63	8	My soul clings to You; Your right hand upholds me.
Psalms	Psa	19	63	9	But those who seek my life to destroy it, Will go into the depths of the earth.
Psalms	Psa	19	63	10	They will be delivered over to the power of the sword; They will be a prey for foxes.
Psalms	Psa	19	63	11	But the king will rejoice in God; Everyone who swears by Him will glory, For the mouths of those who speak lies will be stopped.
Psalms	Psa	19	64	1	Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint; Preserve my life from dread of the enemy.
Psalms	Psa	19	64	2	Hide me from the secret counsel of evildoers, From the tumult of those who do iniquity,
Psalms	Psa	19	64	3	Who have sharpened their tongue like a sword. They aimed bitter speech as their arrow,
Psalms	Psa	19	64	4	To shoot from concealment at the blameless; Suddenly they shoot at him, and do not fear.
Psalms	Psa	19	64	5	They hold fast to themselves an evil purpose; They talk of laying snares secretly; They say, "Who can see them?"
Psalms	Psa	19	64	6	They devise injustices, saying, "We are ready with a well-conceived plot"; For the inward thought and the heart of a man are deep.
Psalms	Psa	19	64	7	But God will shoot at them with an arrow; Suddenly they will be wounded.
Psalms	Psa	19	64	8	So they will make him stumble; Their own tongue is against them; All who see them will shake the head.
Psalms	Psa	19	64	9	Then all men will fear, And they will declare the work of God, And will consider what He has done.
Psalms	Psa	19	64	10	The righteous man will be glad in the LORD and will take refuge in Him; And all the upright in heart will glory.
Psalms	Psa	19	65	1	There will be silence before You, and praise in Zion, O God, And to You the vow will be performed.
Psalms	Psa	19	65	2	O You who hear prayer, To You all men come.
Psalms	Psa	19	65	3	Iniquities prevail against me; As for our transgressions, You forgive them.
Psalms	Psa	19	65	4	How blessed is the one whom You choose and bring near to You To dwell in Your courts. We will be satisfied with the goodness of Your house, Your holy temple.
Psalms	Psa	19	65	5	By awesome deeds You answer us in righteousness, O God of our salvation, You who are the trust of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest sea;
Psalms	Psa	19	65	6	Who establishes the mountains by His strength, Being girded with might;
Psalms	Psa	19	65	7	Who stills the roaring of the seas, The roaring of their waves, And the tumult of the peoples.
Psalms	Psa	19	65	8	They who dwell in the ends of the earth stand in awe of Your signs; You make the dawn and the sunset shout for joy.
Psalms	Psa	19	65	9	You visit the earth and cause it to overflow; You greatly enrich it; The stream of God is full of water; You prepare their grain, for thus You prepare the earth.
Psalms	Psa	19	65	10	You water its furrows abundantly, You settle its ridges, You soften it with showers, You bless its growth.
Psalms	Psa	19	65	11	You have crowned the year with Your bounty, And Your paths drip with fatness.
Psalms	Psa	19	65	12	The pastures of the wilderness drip, And the hills gird themselves with rejoicing.
Psalms	Psa	19	65	13	The meadows are clothed with flocks And the valleys are covered with grain; They shout for joy, yes, they sing.
Psalms	Psa	19	66	1	Shout joyfully to God, all the earth;
Psalms	Psa	19	66	2	Sing the glory of His name; Make His praise glorious.

Psalms	Psa	19	66	11	You brought us into the net; You laid an oppressive burden upon our loins.
Psalms	Psa	19	66	12	You made men ride over our heads; We went through fire and through water, Yet You brought us out into a place of abundance.
Psalms	Psa	19	66	13	I shall come into Your house with burnt offerings; I shall pay You my vows,
Psalms	Psa	19	66	14	Which my lips uttered And my mouth spoke when I was in distress.

Psalms	Psa	19	66	17	I cried to Him with my mouth, And He was extolled with my tongue.
Psalms	Psa	19	66	18	If I regard wickedness in my heart, The Lord will not hear;
Psalms	Psa	19	66	19	But certainly God has heard; He has given heed to the voice of my prayer.
Psalms	Psa	19	66	20	Blessed be God, Who has not turned away my prayer Nor His lovingkindness from me.

Psalms	Psa	19	68	1	Let God arise, let His enemies be scattered, And let those who hate Him flee before Him.
Psalms	Psa	19	68	2	As smoke is driven away, so drive them away; As wax melts before the fire, So let the wicked perish before God.
Psalms	Psa	19	68	3	But let the righteous be glad; let them exult before God; Yes, let them rejoice with gladness.

Psalms	Psa	19	68	5	A father of the fatherless and a judge for the widows, Is God in His holy habitation.
Psalms	Psa	19	68	6	God makes a home for the lonely; He leads out the prisoners into prosperity, Only the rebellious dwell in a parched land.
Psalms	Psa	19	68	7	O God, when You went forth before Your people, When You marched through the wilderness, Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	68	8	The earth quaked; The heavens also dropped rain at the presence of God; Sinai itself quaked at the presence of God, the God of Israel.
Psalms	Psa	19	68	9	You shed abroad a plentiful rain, O God; You confirmed Your inheritance when it was parched.
Psalms	Psa	19	68	10	Your creatures settled in it; You provided in Your goodness for the poor, O God.
Psalms	Psa	19	68	11	The Lord gives the command; The women who proclaim the good tidings are a great host:
Psalms	Psa	19	68	12	"Kings of armies flee, they flee, And she who remains at home will divide the spoil!"
Psalms	Psa	19	68	13	When you lie down among the sheepfolds, You are like the wings of a dove covered with silver, And its pinions with glistening gold.
Psalms	Psa	19	68	14	When the Almighty scattered the kings there, It was snowing in Zalmon.

Psalms	Psa	19	68	23	That your foot may shatter them in blood, The tongue of your dogs may have its portion from your enemies."
Psalms	Psa	19	68	24	They have seen Your procession, O God, The procession of my God, my King, into the sanctuary.

Psalms	Psa	19	69	1	Save me, O God, For the waters have threatened my life.
Psalms	Psa	19	69	2	I have sunk in deep mire, and there is no foothold; I have come into deep waters, and a flood overflows me.
Psalms	Psa	19	69	3	I am weary with my crying; my throat is parched; My eyes fail while I wait for my God.
Psalms	Psa	19	69	4	Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head; Those who would destroy me are powerful, being wrongfully my enemies; What I did not steal, I then have to restore.
Psalms	Psa	19	69	5	O God, it is You who knows my folly, And my wrongs are not hidden from You.
Psalms	Psa	19	69	6	May those who wait for You not be ashamed through me, O Lord GOD of hosts; May those who seek You not be dishonored through me, O God of Israel,
Psalms	Psa	19	69	7	Because for Your sake I have borne reproach; Dishonor has covered my face.
Psalms	Psa	19	69	8	I have become estranged from my brothers And an alien to my mother's sons.
Psalms	Psa	19	69	9	For zeal for Your house has consumed me, And the reproaches of those who reproach You have fallen on me.
Psalms	Psa	19	69	10	When I wept in my soul with fasting, It became my reproach.
Psalms	Psa	19	69	11	When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a byword to them.
Psalms	Psa	19	69	12	Those who sit in the gate talk about me, And I am the song of the drunkards.
Psalms	Psa	19	69	13	But as for me, my prayer is to You, O LORD, at an acceptable time; O God, in the greatness of Your lovingkindness, Answer me with Your saving truth.
Psalms	Psa	19	69	14	Deliver me from the mire and do not let me sink; May I be delivered from my foes and from the deep waters.
Psalms	Psa	19	69	15	May the flood of water not overflow me Nor the deep swallow me up, Nor the pit shut its mouth on me.
Psalms	Psa	19	69	16	Answer me, O LORD, for Your lovingkindness is good; According to the greatness of Your compassion, turn to me,
Psalms	Psa	19	69	17	And do not hide Your face from Your servant, For I am in distress; answer me quickly.
Psalms	Psa	19	69	18	Oh draw near to my soul and redeem it; Ransom me because of my enemies!
Psalms	Psa	19	69	19	You know my reproach and my shame and my dishonor; All my adversaries are before You.
Psalms	Psa	19	69	20	Reproach has broken my heart and I am so sick. And I looked for sympathy, but there was none, And for comforters, but I found none.
Psalms	Psa	19	69	21	They also gave me gall for my food And for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
Psalms	Psa	19	69	22	May their table before them become a snare; And when they are in peace, may it become a trap.
Psalms	Psa	19	69	23	May their eyes grow dim so that they cannot see, And make their loins shake continually.
Psalms	Psa	19	69	24	Pour out Your indignation on them, And may Your burning anger overtake them.
Psalms	Psa	19	69	25	May their camp be desolate; May none dwell in their tents.
Psalms	Psa	19	69	26	For they have persecuted him whom You Yourself have smitten, And they tell of the pain of those whom You have wounded.
Psalms	Psa	19	69	27	Add iniquity to their iniquity, And may they not come into Your righteousness.
Psalms	Psa	19	69	28	May they be blotted out of the book of life And may they not be recorded with the righteous.
Psalms	Psa	19	69	29	But I am afflicted and in pain; May Your salvation, O God, set me securely on high.
Psalms	Psa	19	69	30	I will praise the name of God with song And magnify Him with thanksgiving.
Psalms	Psa	19	69	31	And it will please the LORD better than an ox Or a young bull with horns and hoofs.
Psalms	Psa	19	69	32	The humble have seen it and are glad; You who seek God, let your heart revive.
Psalms	Psa	19	69	33	For the LORD hears the needy And does not despise His who are prisoners.
Psalms	Psa	19	69	34	Let heaven and earth praise Him, The seas and everything that moves in them.
Psalms	Psa	19	69	35	For God will save Zion and build the cities of Judah, That they may dwell there and possess it.
Psalms	Psa	19	69	36	The descendants of His servants will inherit it, And those who love His name will dwell in it.
Psalms	Psa	19	70	1	O God, hasten to deliver me; O LORD, hasten to my help!
Psalms	Psa	19	70	2	Let those be ashamed and humiliated Who seek my life; Let those be turned back and dishonored Who delight in my hurt.
Psalms	Psa	19	70	3	Let those be turned back because of their shame Who say, "Aha, aha!"
Psalms	Psa	19	70	4	Let all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; And let those who love Your salvation say continually, "Let God be magnified."
Psalms	Psa	19	70	5	But I am afflicted and needy; Hasten to me, O God! You are my help and my deliverer; O LORD, do not delay.
Psalms	Psa	19	71	1	In You, O LORD, I have taken refuge; Let me never be ashamed.
Psalms	Psa	19	71	2	In Your righteousness deliver me and rescue me; Incline Your ear to me and save me.
Psalms	Psa	19	71	3	Be to me a rock of habitation to which I may continually come; You have given commandment to save me, For You are my rock and my fortress.
Psalms	Psa	19	71	4	Rescue me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, Out of the grasp of the wrongdoer and ruthless man,
Psalms	Psa	19	71	5	For You are my hope; O Lord GOD, You are my confidence from my youth.
Psalms	Psa	19	71	6	By You I have been sustained from my birth; You are He who took me from my mother's womb; My praise is continually of You.
Psalms	Psa	19	71	7	I have become a marvel to many, For You are my strong refuge.
Psalms	Psa	19	71	8	My mouth is filled with Your praise And with Your glory all day long.
Psalms	Psa	19	71	9	Do not cast me off in the time of old age; Do not forsake me when my strength fails.
Psalms	Psa	19	71	10	For my enemies have spoken against me; And those who watch for my life have consulted together,
Psalms	Psa	19	71	11	Saying, "God has forsaken him; Pursue and seize him, for there is no one to deliver."
Psalms	Psa	19	71	12	O God, do not be far from me; O my God, hasten to my help!
Psalms	Psa	19	71	13	Let those who are adversaries of my soul be ashamed and consumed; Let them be covered with reproach and dishonor, who seek to injure me.
Psalms	Psa	19	71	14	But as for me, I will hope continually, And will praise You yet more and more.
Psalms	Psa	19	71	15	My mouth shall tell of Your righteousness And of Your salvation all day long; For I do not know the sum of them.
Psalms	Psa	19	71	16	I will come with the mighty deeds of the Lord GOD; I will make mention of Your righteousness, Yours alone.
Psalms	Psa	19	71	17	O God, You have taught me from my youth, And I still declare Your wondrous deeds.
Psalms	Psa	19	71	18	And even when I am old and gray, O God, do not forsake me, Until I declare Your strength to this generation, Your power to all who are to come.
Psalms	Psa	19	71	19	For Your righteousness, O God, reaches to the heavens, You who have done great things; O God, who is like You?
Psalms	Psa	19	71	20	You who have shown me many troubles and distresses Will revive me again, And will bring me up again from the depths of the earth.
Psalms	Psa	19	71	21	May You increase my greatness And turn to comfort me.
Psalms	Psa	19	71	22	I will also praise You with a harp, Even Your truth, O my God; To You I will sing praises with the lyre, O Holy One of Israel.
Psalms	Psa	19	71	23	My lips will shout for joy when I sing praises to You; And my soul, which You have redeemed.
Psalms	Psa	19	71	24	My tongue also will utter Your righteousness all day long; For they are ashamed, for they are humiliated who seek my hurt.
Psalms	Psa	19	72	1	Give the king Your judgments, O God, And Your righteousness to the king's son.
Psalms	Psa	19	72	2	May he judge Your people with righteousness And Your afflicted with justice.
Psalms	Psa	19	72	3	Let the mountains bring peace to the people, And the hills, in righteousness.
Psalms	Psa	19	72	4	May he vindicate the afflicted of the people, Save the children of the needy And crush the oppressor.
Psalms	Psa	19	72	5	Let them fear You while the sun endures, And as long as the moon, throughout all generations.
Psalms	Psa	19	72	6	May he come down like rain upon the mown grass, Like showers that water the earth.
Psalms	Psa	19	72	7	In his days may the righteous flourish, And abundance of peace till the moon is no more.
Psalms	Psa	19	72	8	May he also rule from sea to sea And from the River to the ends of the earth.
Psalms	Psa	19	72	9	Let the nomads of the desert bow before him, And his enemies lick the dust.
Psalms	Psa	19	72	10	Let the kings of Tarshish and of the islands bring presents; The kings of Sheba and Seba offer gifts.
Psalms	Psa	19	72	11	And let all kings bow down before him, All nations serve him.
Psalms	Psa	19	72	12	For he will deliver the needy when he cries for help, The afflicted also, and him who has no helper.
Psalms	Psa	19	72	13	He will have compassion on the poor and needy, And the lives of the needy he will save.
Psalms	Psa	19	72	14	He will rescue their life from oppression and violence, And their blood will be precious in his sight;
Psalms	Psa	19	72	15	So may he live, and may the gold of Sheba be given to him; And let them pray for him continually; Let them bless him all day long.
Psalms	Psa	19	72	16	May there be abundance of grain in the earth on top of the mountains; Its fruit will wave like the cedars of Lebanon; And may those from the city flourish like vegetation of the earth.
Psalms	Psa	19	72	17	May his name endure forever; May his name increase as long as the sun shines; And let men bless themselves by him; Let all nations call him blessed.
Psalms	Psa	19	72	18	Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, Who alone works wonders.
Psalms	Psa	19	72	19	And blessed be His glorious name forever; And may the whole earth be filled with His glory. Amen, and Amen.
Psalms	Psa	19	72	20	The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
Psalms	Psa	19	73	1	Surely God is good to Israel, To those who are pure in heart!
Psalms	Psa	19	73	2	But as for me, my feet came close to stumbling, My steps had almost slipped.
Psalms	Psa	19	73	3	For I was envious of the arrogant As I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
Psalms	Psa	19	73	4	For there are no pains in their death, And their body is fat.
Psalms	Psa	19	73	5	They are not in trouble as other men, Nor are they plagued like mankind.
Psalms	Psa	19	73	6	Therefore pride is their necklace; The garment of violence covers them.
Psalms	Psa	19	73	7	Their eye bulges from fatness; The imaginations of their heart run riot.
Psalms	Psa	19	73	8	They mock and wickedly speak of oppression; They speak from on high.
Psalms	Psa	19	73	9	They have set their mouth against the heavens, And their tongue parades through the earth.
Psalms	Psa	19	73	10	Therefore his people return to this place, And waters of abundance are drunk by them.
Psalms	Psa	19	73	11	They say, "How does God know? And is there knowledge with the Most High?"
Psalms	Psa	19	73	12	Behold, these are the wicked; And always at ease, they have increased in wealth.
Psalms	Psa	19	73	13	Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure And washed my hands in innocence;
Psalms	Psa	19	73	14	For I have been stricken all day long And chastened every morning.
Psalms	Psa	19	73	15	If I had said, "I will speak thus," Behold, I would have betrayed the generation of Your children.
Psalms	Psa	19	73	16	When I pondered to understand this, It was troublesome in my sight
Psalms	Psa	19	73	17	Until I came into the sanctuary of God; Then I perceived their end.
Psalms	Psa	19	73	18	Surely You set them in slippery places; You cast them down to destruction.
Psalms	Psa	19	73	19	How they are destroyed in a moment! They are utterly swept away by sudden terrors!
Psalms	Psa	19	73	20	Like a dream when one awakes, O Lord, when aroused, You will despise their form.
Psalms	Psa	19	73	21	When my heart was embittered And I was pierced within,
Psalms	Psa	19	73	22	Then I was senseless and ignorant; I was like a beast before You.
Psalms	Psa	19	73	23	Nevertheless I am continually with You; You have taken hold of my right hand.
Psalms	Psa	19	73	24	With Your counsel You will guide me, And afterward receive me to glory.
Psalms	Psa	19	73	25	Whom have I in heaven but You? And besides You, I desire nothing on earth.
Psalms	Psa	19	73	26	My flesh and my heart may fail, But God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.
Psalms	Psa	19	73	27	For, behold, those who are far from You will perish; You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to You.
Psalms	Psa	19	73	28	But as for me, the nearness of God is my good; I have made the Lord GOD my refuge, That I may tell of all Your works.
Psalms	Psa	19	74	1	O God, why have You rejected us forever? Why does Your anger smoke against the sheep of Your pasture?
Psalms	Psa	19	74	2	Remember Your congregation, which You have purchased of old, Which You have redeemed to be the tribe of Your inheritance; And this Mount Zion, where You have dwelt.
Psalms	Psa	19	74	3	Turn Your footsteps toward the perpetual ruins; The enemy has damaged everything within the sanctuary.
Psalms	Psa	19	74	4	Your adversaries have roared in the midst of Your meeting place; They have set up their own standards for signs.
Psalms	Psa	19	74	5	It seems as if one had lifted up His axe in a forest of trees.
Psalms	Psa	19	74	6	And now all its carved work They smash with hatchet and hammers.
Psalms	Psa	19	74	7	They have burned Your sanctuary to the ground; They have defiled the dwelling place of Your name.
Psalms	Psa	19	74	8	They said in their heart, "Let us completely subdue them." They have burned all the meeting places of God in the land.
Psalms	Psa	19	74	9	We do not see our signs; There is no longer any prophet, Nor is there any among us who knows how long.
Psalms	Psa	19	74	10	How long, O God, will the adversary revile, And the enemy spurn Your name forever?
Psalms	Psa	19	74	11	Why do You withdraw Your hand, even Your right hand? From within Your bosom, destroy them!
Psalms	Psa	19	74	12	Yet God is my king from of old, Who works deeds of deliverance in the midst of the earth.
Psalms	Psa	19	74	13	You divided the sea by Your strength; You broke the heads of the sea monsters in the waters.
Psalms	Psa	19	74	14	You crushed the heads of Leviathan; You gave him as food for the creatures of the wilderness.
Psalms	Psa	19	74	15	You broke open springs and torrents; You dried up ever-flowing streams.
Psalms	Psa	19	74	16	Yours is the day, Yours also is the night; You have prepared the light and the sun.
Psalms	Psa	19	74	17	You have established all the boundaries of the earth; You have made summer and winter.
Psalms	Psa	19	74	18	Remember this, O LORD, that the enemy has reviled, And a foolish people has spurned Your name.
Psalms	Psa	19	74	19	Do not deliver the soul of Your turtledove to the wild beast; Do not forget the life of Your afflicted forever.
Psalms	Psa	19	74	20	Consider the covenant; For the dark places of the land are full of the habitations of violence.
Psalms	Psa	19	74	21	Let not the oppressed return dishonored; Let the afflicted and needy praise Your name.
Psalms	Psa	19	74	22	Arise, O God, and plead Your own cause; Remember how the foolish man reproaches You all day long.
Psalms	Psa	19	74	23	Do not forget the voice of Your adversaries, The uproar of those who rise against You which ascends continually.
Psalms	Psa	19	75	1	We give thanks to You, O God, we give thanks, For Your name is near; Men declare Your wondrous works.
Psalms	Psa	19	75	2	"When I select an appointed time, It is I who judge with equity.
Psalms	Psa	19	75	3	"The earth and all who dwell in it melt; It is I who have firmly set its pillars. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	75	4	"I said to the boastful, 'Do not boast,' And to the wicked, 'Do not lift up the horn;
Psalms	Psa	19	75	5	Do not lift up your horn on high, Do not speak with insolent pride.'"
Psalms	Psa	19	75	6	For not from the east, nor from the west, Nor from the desert comes exaltation;
Psalms	Psa	19	75	7	But God is the Judge; He puts down one and exalts another.
Psalms	Psa	19	75	8	For a cup is in the hand of the LORD, and the wine foams; It is well mixed, and He pours out of this; Surely all the wicked of the earth must drain and drink down its dregs.
Psalms	Psa	19	75	9	But as for me, I will declare it forever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
Psalms	Psa	19	75	10	And all the horns of the wicked He will cut off, But the horns of the righteous will be lifted up.
Psalms	Psa	19	76	1	God is known in Judah; His name is great in Israel.
Psalms	Psa	19	76	2	His tabernacle is in Salem; His dwelling place also is in Zion.
Psalms	Psa	19	76	3	There He broke the flaming arrows, The shield and the sword and the weapons of war. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	76	4	You are resplendent, More majestic than the mountains of prey.
Psalms	Psa	19	76	5	The stouthearted were plundered, They sank into sleep; And none of the warriors could use his hands.
Psalms	Psa	19	76	6	At Your rebuke, O God of Jacob, Both rider and horse were cast into a dead sleep.
Psalms	Psa	19	76	7	You, even You, are to be feared; And who may stand in Your presence when once You are angry?
Psalms	Psa	19	76	8	You caused judgment to be heard from heaven; The earth feared and was still
Psalms	Psa	19	76	9	When God arose to judgment, To save all the humble of the earth. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	76	10	For the wrath of man shall praise You; With a remnant of wrath You will gird Yourself.
Psalms	Psa	19	76	11	Make vows to the LORD your God and fulfill them; Let all who are around Him bring gifts to Him who is to be feared.
Psalms	Psa	19	76	12	He will cut off the spirit of princes; He is feared by the kings of the earth.
Psalms	Psa	19	77	1	My voice rises to God, and I will cry aloud; My voice rises to God, and He will hear me.
Psalms	Psa	19	77	2	In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord; In the night my hand was stretched out without weariness; My soul refused to be comforted.
Psalms	Psa	19	77	3	When I remember God, then I am disturbed; When I sigh, then my spirit grows faint. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	77	4	You have held my eyelids open; I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
Psalms	Psa	19	77	5	I have considered the days of old, The years of long ago.
Psalms	Psa	19	77	6	I will remember my song in the night; I will meditate with my heart, And my spirit ponders:
Psalms	Psa	19	77	7	Will the Lord reject forever? And will He never be favorable again?
Psalms	Psa	19	77	8	Has His lovingkindness ceased forever? Has His promise come to an end forever?
Psalms	Psa	19	77	9	Has God forgotten to be gracious, Or has He in anger withdrawn His compassion? Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	77	10	Then I said, "It is my grief, That the right hand of the Most High has changed."
Psalms	Psa	19	77	11	I shall remember the deeds of the LORD; Surely I will remember Your wonders of old.
Psalms	Psa	19	77	12	I will meditate on all Your work And muse on Your deeds.
Psalms	Psa	19	77	13	Your way, O God, is holy; What god is great like our God?
Psalms	Psa	19	77	14	You are the God who works wonders; You have made known Your strength among the peoples.
Psalms	Psa	19	77	15	You have by Your power redeemed Your people, The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	77	16	The waters saw You, O God; The waters saw You, they were in anguish; The deeps also trembled.
Psalms	Psa	19	77	17	The clouds poured out water; The skies gave forth a sound; Your arrows flashed here and there.
Psalms	Psa	19	77	18	The sound of Your thunder was in the whirlwind; The lightnings lit up the world; The earth trembled and shook.
Psalms	Psa	19	77	19	Your way was in the sea And Your paths in the mighty waters, And Your footprints may not be known.
Psalms	Psa	19	77	20	You led Your people like a flock By the hand of Moses and Aaron.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	1	Listen, O my people, to my instruction; Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	2	I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings of old,
Psalms	Psa	19	78	3	Which we have heard and known, And our fathers have told us.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	4	We will not conceal them from their children, But tell to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, And His strength and His wondrous works that He has done.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	5	For He established a testimony in Jacob And appointed a law in Israel, Which He commanded our fathers That they should teach them to their children,
Psalms	Psa	19	78	6	That the generation to come might know, even the children yet to be born, That they may arise and tell them to their children,
Psalms	Psa	19	78	7	That they should put their confidence in God And not forget the works of God, But keep His commandments,
Psalms	Psa	19	78	8	And not be like their fathers, A stubborn and rebellious generation, A generation that did not prepare its heart And whose spirit was not faithful to God.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	9	The sons of Ephraim were archers equipped with bows, Yet they turned back in the day of battle.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	10	They did not keep the covenant of God And refused to walk in His law;
Psalms	Psa	19	78	11	They forgot His deeds And His miracles that He had shown them.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	12	He wrought wonders before their fathers In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	13	He divided the sea and caused them to pass through, And He made the waters stand up like a heap.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	14	Then He led them with the cloud by day And all the night with a light of fire.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	15	He split the rocks in the wilderness And gave them abundant drink like the ocean depths.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	16	He brought forth streams also from the rock And caused waters to run down like rivers.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	17	Yet they still continued to sin against Him, To rebel against the Most High in the desert.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	18	And in their heart they put God to the test By asking food according to their desire.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	19	Then they spoke against God; They said, "Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?
Psalms	Psa	19	78	20	"Behold, He struck the rock so that waters gushed out, And streams were overflowing; Can He give bread also? Will He provide meat for His people?"
Psalms	Psa	19	78	21	Therefore the LORD heard and was full of wrath; And a fire was kindled against Jacob And anger also mounted against Israel,
Psalms	Psa	19	78	22	Because they did not believe in God And did not trust in His salvation.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	23	Yet He commanded the clouds above And opened the doors of heaven;
Psalms	Psa	19	78	24	He rained down manna upon them to eat And gave them food from heaven.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	25	Man did eat the bread of angels; He sent them food in abundance.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	26	He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens And by His power He directed the south wind.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	27	When He rained meat upon them like the dust, Even winged fowl like the sand of the seas,
Psalms	Psa	19	78	28	Then He let them fall in the midst of their camp, Round about their dwellings.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	29	So they ate and were well filled, And their desire He gave to them.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	30	Before they had satisfied their desire, While their food was in their mouths,
Psalms	Psa	19	78	31	The anger of God rose against them And killed some of their stoutest ones, And subdued the choice men of Israel.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	32	In spite of all this they still sinned And did not believe in His wonderful works.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	33	So He brought their days to an end in futility And their years in sudden terror.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	34	When He killed them, then they sought Him, And returned and searched diligently for God;
Psalms	Psa	19	78	35	And they remembered that God was their rock, And the Most High God their Redeemer.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	36	But they deceived Him with their mouth And lied to Him with their tongue.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	37	For their heart was not steadfast toward Him, Nor were they faithful in His covenant.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	38	But He, being compassionate, forgave their iniquity and did not destroy them; And often He restrained His anger And did not arouse all His wrath.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	39	Thus He remembered that they were but flesh, A wind that passes and does not return.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	40	How often they rebelled against Him in the wilderness And grieved Him in the desert!
Psalms	Psa	19	78	41	Again and again they tempted God, And pained the Holy One of Israel.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	42	They did not remember His power, The day when He redeemed them from the adversary,
Psalms	Psa	19	78	43	When He performed His signs in Egypt And His marvels in the field of Zoan,
Psalms	Psa	19	78	44	And turned their rivers to blood, And their streams, they could not drink.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	45	He sent among them swarms of flies which devoured them, And frogs which destroyed them.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	46	He gave also their crops to the grasshopper And the product of their labor to the locust.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	47	He destroyed their vines with hailstones And their sycamore trees with frost.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	48	He gave over their cattle also to the hailstones And their herds to bolts of lightning.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	49	He sent upon them His burning anger, Fury and indignation and trouble, A band of destroying angels.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	50	He leveled a path for His anger; He did not spare their soul from death, But gave over their life to the plague,
Psalms	Psa	19	78	51	And smote all the firstborn in Egypt, The first issue of their virility in the tents of Ham.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	52	But He led forth His own people like sheep And guided them in the wilderness like a flock;
Psalms	Psa	19	78	53	He led them safely, so that they did not fear; But the sea engulfed their enemies.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	54	So He brought them to His holy land, To this hill country which His right hand had gained.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	55	He also drove out the nations before them And apportioned them for an inheritance by measurement, And made the tribes of Israel dwell in their tents.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	56	Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God And did not keep His testimonies,
Psalms	Psa	19	78	57	But turned back and acted treacherously like their fathers; They turned aside like a treacherous bow.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	58	For they provoked Him with their high places And aroused His jealousy with their graven images.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	59	When God heard, He was filled with wrath And greatly abhorred Israel;
Psalms	Psa	19	78	60	So that He abandoned the dwelling place at Shiloh, The tent which He had pitched among men,
Psalms	Psa	19	78	61	And gave up His strength to captivity And His glory into the hand of the adversary.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	62	He also delivered His people to the sword, And was filled with wrath at His inheritance.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	63	Fire devoured His young men, And His virgins had no wedding songs.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	64	His priests fell by the sword, And His widows could not weep.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	65	Then the Lord awoke as if from sleep, Like a warrior overcome by wine.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	66	He drove His adversaries backward; He put on them an everlasting reproach.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	67	He also rejected the tent of Joseph, And did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,
Psalms	Psa	19	78	68	But chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion which He loved.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	69	And He built His sanctuary like the heights, Like the earth which He has founded forever.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	70	He also chose David His servant And took him from the sheepfolds;
Psalms	Psa	19	78	71	From the care of the ewes with suckling lambs He brought him To shepherd Jacob His people, And Israel His inheritance.
Psalms	Psa	19	78	72	So he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart, And guided them with his skillful hands.
Psalms	Psa	19	79	1	O God, the nations have invaded Your inheritance; They have defiled Your holy temple; They have laid Jerusalem in ruins.
Psalms	Psa	19	79	2	They have given the dead bodies of Your servants for food to the birds of the heavens, The flesh of Your godly ones to the beasts of the earth.
Psalms	Psa	19	79	3	They have poured out their blood like water round about Jerusalem; And there was no one to bury them.
Psalms	Psa	19	79	4	We have become a reproach to our neighbors, A scoffing and derision to those around us.
Psalms	Psa	19	79	5	How long, O LORD? Will You be angry forever? Will Your jealousy burn like fire?
Psalms	Psa	19	79	6	Pour out Your wrath upon the nations which do not know You, And upon the kingdoms which do not call upon Your name.
Psalms	Psa	19	79	7	For they have devoured Jacob And laid waste his habitation.
Psalms	Psa	19	79	8	Do not remember the iniquities of our forefathers against us; Let Your compassion come quickly to meet us, For we are brought very low.
Psalms	Psa	19	79	9	Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of Your name; And deliver us and forgive our sins for Your name's sake.
Psalms	Psa	19	79	10	Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?" Let there be known among the nations in our sight, Vengeance for the blood of Your servants which has been shed.
Psalms	Psa	19	79	11	Let the groaning of the prisoner come before You; According to the greatness of Your power preserve those who are doomed to die.
Psalms	Psa	19	79	12	And return to our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom The reproach with which they have reproached You, O Lord.
Psalms	Psa	19	79	13	So we Your people and the sheep of Your pasture Will give thanks to You forever; To all generations we will tell of Your praise.
Psalms	Psa	19	80	1	Oh, give ear, Shepherd of Israel, You who lead Joseph like a flock; You who are enthroned above the cherubim, shine forth!
Psalms	Psa	19	80	2	Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up Your power And come to save us!
Psalms	Psa	19	80	3	O God, restore us And cause Your face to shine upon us, and we will be saved.
Psalms	Psa	19	80	4	O LORD God of hosts, How long will You be angry with the prayer of Your people?
Psalms	Psa	19	80	5	You have fed them with the bread of tears, And You have made them to drink tears in large measure.
Psalms	Psa	19	80	6	You make us an object of contention to our neighbors, And our enemies laugh among themselves.
Psalms	Psa	19	80	7	O God of hosts, restore us And cause Your face to shine upon us, and we will be saved.
Psalms	Psa	19	80	8	You removed a vine from Egypt; You drove out the nations and planted it.
Psalms	Psa	19	80	9	You cleared the ground before it, And it took deep root and filled the land.
Psalms	Psa	19	80	10	The mountains were covered with its shadow, And the cedars of God with its boughs.
Psalms	Psa	19	80	11	It was sending out its branches to the sea And its shoots to the River.
Psalms	Psa	19	80	12	Why have You broken down its hedges, So that all who pass that way pick its fruit?
Psalms	Psa	19	80	13	A boar from the forest eats it away And whatever moves in the field feeds on it.
Psalms	Psa	19	80	14	O God of hosts, turn again now, we beseech You; Look down from heaven and see, and take care of this vine,
Psalms	Psa	19	80	15	Even the shoot which Your right hand has planted, And on the son whom You have strengthened for Yourself.
Psalms	Psa	19	80	16	It is burned with fire, it is cut down; They perish at the rebuke of Your countenance.
Psalms	Psa	19	80	17	Let Your hand be upon the man of Your right hand, Upon the son of man whom You made strong for Yourself.
Psalms	Psa	19	80	18	Then we shall not turn back from You; Revive us, and we will call upon Your name.
Psalms	Psa	19	80	19	O LORD God of hosts, restore us; Cause Your face to shine upon us, and we will be saved.
Psalms	Psa	19	81	1	Sing for joy to God our strength; Shout joyfully to the God of Jacob.
Psalms	Psa	19	81	2	Raise a song, strike the timbrel, The sweet sounding lyre with the harp.
Psalms	Psa	19	81	3	Blow the trumpet at the new moon, At the full moon, on our feast day.
Psalms	Psa	19	81	4	For it is a statute for Israel, An ordinance of the God of Jacob.
Psalms	Psa	19	81	5	He established it for a testimony in Joseph When he went throughout the land of Egypt. I heard a language that I did not know:
Psalms	Psa	19	81	6	"I relieved his shoulder of the burden, His hands were freed from the basket.
Psalms	Psa	19	81	7	"You called in trouble and I rescued you; I answered you in the hiding place of thunder; I proved you at the waters of Meribah. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	81	8	"Hear, O My people, and I will admonish you; O Israel, if you would listen to Me!
Psalms	Psa	19	81	9	"Let there be no strange god among you; Nor shall you worship any foreign god.
Psalms	Psa	19	81	10	"I, the LORD, am your God, Who brought you up from the land of Egypt; Open your mouth wide and I will fill it.
Psalms	Psa	19	81	11	"But My people did not listen to My voice, And Israel did not obey Me.
Psalms	Psa	19	81	12	"So I gave them over to the stubbornness of their heart, To walk in their own devices.
Psalms	Psa	19	81	13	"Oh that My people would listen to Me, That Israel would walk in My ways!
Psalms	Psa	19	81	14	"I would quickly subdue their enemies And turn My hand against their adversaries.
Psalms	Psa	19	81	15	"Those who hate the LORD would pretend obedience to Him, And their time of punishment would be forever.
Psalms	Psa	19	81	16	"But I would feed you with the finest of the wheat, And with honey from the rock I would satisfy you."
Psalms	Psa	19	82	1	God takes His stand in His own congregation; He judges in the midst of the rulers.
Psalms	Psa	19	82	2	How long will you judge unjustly And show partiality to the wicked? Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	82	3	Vindicate the weak and fatherless; Do justice to the afflicted and destitute.
Psalms	Psa	19	82	4	Rescue the weak and needy; Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked.
Psalms	Psa	19	82	5	They do not know nor do they understand; They walk about in darkness; All the foundations of the earth are shaken.
Psalms	Psa	19	82	6	I said, "You are gods, And all of you are sons of the Most High.
Psalms	Psa	19	82	7	"Nevertheless you will die like men And fall like any one of the princes."
Psalms	Psa	19	82	8	Arise, O God, judge the earth! For it is You who possesses all the nations.
Psalms	Psa	19	83	1	O God, do not remain quiet; Do not be silent and, O God, do not be still.
Psalms	Psa	19	83	2	For behold, Your enemies make an uproar, And those who hate You have exalted themselves.
Psalms	Psa	19	83	3	They make shrewd plans against Your people, And conspire together against Your treasured ones.
Psalms	Psa	19	83	4	They have said, "Come, and let us wipe them out as a nation, That the name of Israel be remembered no more."
Psalms	Psa	19	83	5	For they have conspired together with one mind; Against You they make a covenant:
Psalms	Psa	19	83	6	The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagrites;
Psalms	Psa	19	83	7	Gebal and Ammon and Amalek, Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;
Psalms	Psa	19	83	8	Assyria also has joined with them; They have become a help to the children of Lot. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	83	9	Deal with them as with Midian, As with Sisera and Jabin at the torrent of Kishon,
Psalms	Psa	19	83	10	Who were destroyed at En-dor, Who became as dung for the ground.
Psalms	Psa	19	83	11	Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb And all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,
Psalms	Psa	19	83	12	Who said, "Let us possess for ourselves The pastures of God."
Psalms	Psa	19	83	13	O my God, make them like the whirling dust, Like chaff before the wind.
Psalms	Psa	19	83	14	Like fire that burns the forest And like a flame that sets the mountains on fire,
Psalms	Psa	19	83	15	So pursue them with Your tempest And terrify them with Your storm.
Psalms	Psa	19	83	16	Fill their faces with dishonor, That they may seek Your name, O LORD.
Psalms	Psa	19	83	17	Let them be ashamed and dismayed forever, And let them be humiliated and perish,
Psalms	Psa	19	83	18	That they may know that You alone, whose name is the LORD, Are the Most High over all the earth.
Psalms	Psa	19	84	1	How lovely are Your dwelling places, O LORD of hosts!
Psalms	Psa	19	84	2	My soul longed and even yearned for the courts of the LORD; My heart and my flesh sing for joy to the living God.
Psalms	Psa	19	84	3	The bird also has found a house, And the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, Even Your altars, O LORD of hosts, My King and my God.
Psalms	Psa	19	84	4	How blessed are those who dwell in Your house! They are ever praising You. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	84	5	How blessed is the man whose strength is in You, In whose heart are the highways to Zion!
Psalms	Psa	19	84	6	Passing through the valley of Baca they make it a spring; The early rain also covers it with blessings.
Psalms	Psa	19	84	7	They go from strength to strength, Every one of them appears before God in Zion.
Psalms	Psa	19	84	8	O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer; Give ear, O God of Jacob! Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	84	9	Behold our shield, O God, And look upon the face of Your anointed.
Psalms	Psa	19	84	10	For a day in Your courts is better than a thousand outside. I would rather stand at the threshold of the house of my God Than dwell in the tents of wickedness.
Psalms	Psa	19	84	11	For the LORD God is a sun and shield; The LORD gives grace and glory; No good thing does He withhold from those who walk uprightly.
Psalms	Psa	19	84	12	O LORD of hosts, How blessed is the man who trusts in You!
Psalms	Psa	19	85	1	O LORD, You showed favor to Your land; You restored the captivity of Jacob.
Psalms	Psa	19	85	2	You forgave the iniquity of Your people; You covered all their sin. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	85	3	You withdrew all Your fury; You turned away from Your burning anger.
Psalms	Psa	19	85	4	Restore us, O God of our salvation, And cause Your indignation toward us to cease.
Psalms	Psa	19	85	5	Will You be angry with us forever? Will You prolong Your anger to all generations?
Psalms	Psa	19	85	6	Will You not Yourself revive us again, That Your people may rejoice in You?
Psalms	Psa	19	85	7	Show us Your lovingkindness, O LORD, And grant us Your salvation.
Psalms	Psa	19	85	8	I will hear what God the LORD will say; For He will speak peace to His people, to His godly ones; But let them not turn back to folly.
Psalms	Psa	19	85	9	Surely His salvation is near to those who fear Him, That glory may dwell in our land.
Psalms	Psa	19	85	10	Lovingkindness and truth have met together; Righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
Psalms	Psa	19	85	11	Truth springs from the earth, And righteousness looks down from heaven.
Psalms	Psa	19	85	12	Indeed, the LORD will give what is good, And our land will yield its produce.
Psalms	Psa	19	85	13	Righteousness will go before Him And will make His footsteps into a way.
Psalms	Psa	19	86	1	Incline Your ear, O LORD, and answer me; For I am afflicted and needy.
Psalms	Psa	19	86	2	Preserve my soul, for I am a godly man; O You my God, save Your servant who trusts in You.
Psalms	Psa	19	86	3	Be gracious to me, O Lord, For to You I cry all day long.
Psalms	Psa	19	86	4	Make glad the soul of Your servant, For to You, O Lord, I lift up my soul.
Psalms	Psa	19	86	5	For You, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive, And abundant in lovingkindness to all who call upon You.
Psalms	Psa	19	86	6	Give ear, O LORD, to my prayer; And give heed to the voice of my supplications!
Psalms	Psa	19	86	7	In the day of my trouble I shall call upon You, For You will answer me.
Psalms	Psa	19	86	8	There is no one like You among the gods, O Lord, Nor are there any works like Yours.
Psalms	Psa	19	86	9	All nations whom You have made shall come and worship before You, O Lord, And they shall glorify Your name.
Psalms	Psa	19	86	10	For You are great and do wondrous deeds; You alone are God.
Psalms	Psa	19	86	11	Teach me Your way, O LORD; I will walk in Your truth; Unite my heart to fear Your name.
Psalms	Psa	19	86	12	I will give thanks to You, O Lord my God, with all my heart, And will glorify Your name forever.
Psalms	Psa	19	86	13	For Your lovingkindness toward me is great, And You have delivered my soul from the depths of Sheol.
Psalms	Psa	19	86	14	O God, arrogant men have risen up against me, And a band of violent men have sought my life, And they have not set You before them.
Psalms	Psa	19	86	15	But You, O Lord, are a God merciful and gracious, Slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness and truth.
Psalms	Psa	19	86	16	Turn to me, and be gracious to me; Oh grant Your strength to Your servant, And save the son of Your handmaid.
Psalms	Psa	19	86	17	Show me a sign for good, That those who hate me may see it and be ashamed, Because You, O LORD, have helped me and comforted me.
Psalms	Psa	19	87	1	His foundation is in the holy mountains.
Psalms	Psa	19	87	2	The LORD loves the gates of Zion More than all the other dwelling places of Jacob.
Psalms	Psa	19	87	3	Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of God. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	87	4	"I shall mention Rahab and Babylon among those who know Me; Behold, Philistia and Tyre with Ethiopia: 'This one was born there.'"
Psalms	Psa	19	87	5	But of Zion it shall be said, "This one and that one were born in her"; And the Most High Himself will establish her.
Psalms	Psa	19	87	6	The LORD will count when He registers the peoples, "This one was born there." Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	87	7	Then those who sing as well as those who play the flutes shall say, "All my springs of joy are in you."
Psalms	Psa	19	88	1	O LORD, the God of my salvation, I have cried out by day and in the night before You.
Psalms	Psa	19	88	2	Let my prayer come before You; Incline Your ear to my cry!
Psalms	Psa	19	88	3	For my soul has had enough troubles, And my life has drawn near to Sheol.
Psalms	Psa	19	88	4	I am reckoned among those who go down to the pit; I have become like a man without strength,
Psalms	Psa	19	88	5	Forsaken among the dead, Like the slain who lie in the grave, Whom You remember no more, And they are cut off from Your hand.
Psalms	Psa	19	88	6	You have put me in the lowest pit, In dark places, in the depths.
Psalms	Psa	19	88	7	Your wrath has rested upon me, And You have afflicted me with all Your waves. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	88	8	You have removed my acquaintances far from me; You have made me an object of loathing to them; I am shut up and cannot go out.
Psalms	Psa	19	88	9	My eye has wasted away because of affliction; I have called upon You every day, O LORD; I have spread out my hands to You.
Psalms	Psa	19	88	10	Will You perform wonders for the dead? Will the departed spirits rise and praise You? Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	88	11	Will Your lovingkindness be declared in the grave, Your faithfulness in Abaddon?
Psalms	Psa	19	88	12	Will Your wonders be made known in the darkness? And Your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
Psalms	Psa	19	88	13	But I, O LORD, have cried out to You for help, And in the morning my prayer comes before You.
Psalms	Psa	19	88	14	O LORD, why do You reject my soul? Why do You hide Your face from me?
Psalms	Psa	19	88	15	I was afflicted and about to die from my youth on; I suffer Your terrors; I am overcome.
Psalms	Psa	19	88	16	Your burning anger has passed over me; Your terrors have destroyed me.

Psalms	Psa	19	103	3	Who pardons all your iniquities, Who heals all your diseases;
Psalms	Psa	19	103	4	Who redeems your life from the pit, Who crowns you with lovingkindness and compassion;
Psalms	Psa	19	103	5	Who satisfies your years with good things, So that your youth is renewed like the eagle.
Psalms	Psa	19	103	6	The LORD performs righteous deeds And judgments for all who are oppressed.
Psalms	Psa	19	103	7	He made known His ways to Moses, His acts to the sons of Israel.
Psalms	Psa	19	103	8	The LORD is compassionate and gracious, Slow to anger and abounding in lovingkindness.
Psalms	Psa	19	103	9	He will not always strive with us, Nor will He keep His anger forever.
Psalms	Psa	19	103	10	He has not dealt with us according to our sins, Nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
Psalms	Psa	19	103	11	For as high as the heavens are above the earth, So great is His lovingkindness toward those who fear Him.
Psalms	Psa	19	103	12	As far as the east is from the west, So far has He removed our transgressions from us.
Psalms	Psa	19	103	13	Just as a father has compassion on his children, So the LORD has compassion on those who fear Him.
Psalms	Psa	19	103	14	For He Himself knows our frame; He is mindful that we are but dust.
Psalms	Psa	19	103	15	As for man, his days are like grass; As a flower of the field, so he flourishes.
Psalms	Psa	19	103	16	When the wind has passed over it, it is no more, And its place acknowledges it no longer.
Psalms	Psa	19	103	17	But the lovingkindness of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear Him, And His righteousness to children's children,
Psalms	Psa	19	103	18	To those who keep His covenant And remember His precepts to do them.
Psalms	Psa	19	103	19	The LORD has established His throne in the heavens, And His sovereignty rules over all.
Psalms	Psa	19	103	20	Bless the LORD, you His angels, Mighty in strength, who perform His word, Obeying the voice of His word!
Psalms	Psa	19	103	21	Bless the LORD, all you His hosts, You who serve Him, doing His will.
Psalms	Psa	19	103	22	Bless the LORD, all you works of His, In all places of His dominion; Bless the LORD, O my soul!
Psalms	Psa	19	104	1	Bless the LORD, O my soul! O LORD my God, You are very great; You are clothed with splendor and majesty,
Psalms	Psa	19	104	2	Covering Yourself with light as with a cloak, Stretching out heaven like a tent curtain.
Psalms	Psa	19	104	3	He lays the beams of His upper chambers in the waters; He makes the clouds His chariot; He walks upon the wings of the wind;
Psalms	Psa	19	104	4	He makes the winds His messengers, Flaming fire His ministers.
Psalms	Psa	19	104	5	He established the earth upon its foundations, So that it will not totter forever and ever.
Psalms	Psa	19	104	6	You covered it with the deep as with a garment; The waters were standing above the mountains.
Psalms	Psa	19	104	7	At Your rebuke they fled, At the sound of Your thunder they hurried away.
Psalms	Psa	19	104	8	The mountains rose; the valleys sank down To the place which You established for them.
Psalms	Psa	19	104	9	You set a boundary that they may not pass over, So that they will not return to cover the earth.
Psalms	Psa	19	104	10	He sends forth springs in the valleys; They flow between the mountains;
Psalms	Psa	19	104	11	They give drink to every beast of the field; The wild donkeys quench their thirst.
Psalms	Psa	19	104	12	Beside them the birds of the heavens dwell; They lift up their voices among the branches.
Psalms	Psa	19	104	13	He waters the mountains from His upper chambers; The earth is satisfied with the fruit of His works.
Psalms	Psa	19	104	14	He causes the grass to grow for the cattle, And vegetation for the labor of man, So that he may bring forth food from the earth,
Psalms	Psa	19	104	15	And wine which makes man's heart glad, So that he may make his face glisten with oil, And food which sustains man's heart.
Psalms	Psa	19	104	16	The trees of the LORD drink their fill, The cedars of Lebanon which He planted,
Psalms	Psa	19	104	17	Where the birds build their nests, And the stork, whose home is the fir trees.
Psalms	Psa	19	104	18	The high mountains are for the wild goats; The cliffs are a refuge for the shephanim.
Psalms	Psa	19	104	19	He made the moon for the seasons; The sun knows the place of its setting.
Psalms	Psa	19	104	20	You appoint darkness and it becomes night, In which all the beasts of the forest prowl about.
Psalms	Psa	19	104	21	The young lions roar after their prey And seek their food from God.
Psalms	Psa	19	104	22	When the sun rises they withdraw And lie down in their dens.
Psalms	Psa	19	104	23	Man goes forth to his work And to his labor until evening.
Psalms	Psa	19	104	24	O LORD, how many are Your works! In wisdom You have made them all; The earth is full of Your possessions.
Psalms	Psa	19	104	25	There is the sea, great and broad, In which are swarms without number, Animals both small and great.
Psalms	Psa	19	104	26	There the ships move along, And Leviathan, which You have formed to sport in it.
Psalms	Psa	19	104	27	They all wait for You To give them their food in due season.
Psalms	Psa	19	104	28	You give to them, they gather it up; You open Your hand, they are satisfied with good.
Psalms	Psa	19	104	29	You hide Your face, they are dismayed; You take away their spirit, they expire And return to their dust.
Psalms	Psa	19	104	30	You send forth Your Spirit, they are created; And You renew the face of the ground.
Psalms	Psa	19	104	31	Let the glory of the LORD endure forever; Let the LORD be glad in His works;
Psalms	Psa	19	104	32	He looks at the earth, and it trembles; He touches the mountains, and they smoke.
Psalms	Psa	19	104	33	I will sing to the LORD as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.
Psalms	Psa	19	104	34	Let my meditation be pleasing to Him; As for me, I shall be glad in the LORD.
Psalms	Psa	19	104	35	Let sinners be consumed from the earth And let the wicked be no more. Bless the LORD, O my soul. Praise the LORD!
Psalms	Psa	19	105	1	Oh give thanks to the LORD, call upon His name; Make known His deeds among the peoples.
Psalms	Psa	19	105	2	Sing to Him, sing praises to Him; Speak of all His wonders.
Psalms	Psa	19	105	3	Glory in His holy name; Let the heart of those who seek the LORD be glad.
Psalms	Psa	19	105	4	Seek the LORD and His strength; Seek His face continually.
Psalms	Psa	19	105	5	Remember His wonders which He has done, His marvels and the judgments uttered by His mouth,
Psalms	Psa	19	105	6	O seed of Abraham, His servant, O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones!
Psalms	Psa	19	105	7	He is the LORD our God; His judgments are in all the earth.
Psalms	Psa	19	105	8	He has remembered His covenant forever, The word which He commanded to a thousand generations,
Psalms	Psa	19	105	9	The covenant which He made with Abraham, And His oath to Isaac.
Psalms	Psa	19	105	10	Then He confirmed it to Jacob for a statute, To Israel as an everlasting covenant,
Psalms	Psa	19	105	11	Saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan As the portion of your inheritance,"
Psalms	Psa	19	105	12	When they were only a few men in number, Very few, and strangers in it.
Psalms	Psa	19	105	13	And they wandered about from nation to nation, From one kingdom to another people.
Psalms	Psa	19	105	14	He permitted no man to oppress them, And He reproved kings for their sakes:
Psalms	Psa	19	105	15	"Do not touch My anointed ones, And do My prophets no harm."
Psalms	Psa	19	105	16	And He called for a famine upon the land; He broke the whole staff of bread.
Psalms	Psa	19	105	17	He sent a man before them, Joseph, who was sold as a slave.
Psalms	Psa	19	105	18	They afflicted his feet with fetters, He himself was laid in irons;
Psalms	Psa	19	105	19	Until the time that his word came to pass, The word of the LORD tested him.
Psalms	Psa	19	105	20	The king sent and released him, The ruler of peoples, and set him free.
Psalms	Psa	19	105	21	He made him lord of his house And ruler over all his possessions,
Psalms	Psa	19	105	22	To imprison his princes at will, That he might teach his elders wisdom.
Psalms	Psa	19	105	23	Israel also came into Egypt; Thus Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
Psalms	Psa	19	105	24	And He caused His people to be very fruitful, And made them stronger than their adversaries.
Psalms	Psa	19	105	25	He turned their heart to hate His people, To deal craftily with His servants.
Psalms	Psa	19	105	26	He sent Moses His servant, And Aaron, whom He had chosen.
Psalms	Psa	19	105	27	They performed His wondrous acts among them, And miracles in the land of Ham.
Psalms	Psa	19	105	28	He sent darkness and made it dark; And they did not rebel against His words.
Psalms	Psa	19	105	29	He turned their waters into blood And caused their fish to die.
Psalms	Psa	19	105	30	Their land swarmed with frogs Even in the chambers of their kings.
Psalms	Psa	19	105	31	He spoke, and there came a swarm of flies And gnats in all their territory.
Psalms	Psa	19	105	32	He gave them hail for rain, And flaming fire in their land.
Psalms	Psa	19	105	33	He struck down their vines also and their fig trees, And shattered the trees of their territory.
Psalms	Psa	19	105	34	He spoke, and locusts came, And young locusts, even without number,
Psalms	Psa	19	105	35	And ate up all vegetation in their land, And ate up the fruit of their ground.
Psalms	Psa	19	105	36	He also struck down all the firstborn in their land, The first fruits of all their vigor.
Psalms	Psa	19	105	37	Then He brought them out with silver and gold, And among His tribes there was not one who stumbled.
Psalms	Psa	19	105	38	Egypt was glad when they departed, For the dread of them had fallen upon them.
Psalms	Psa	19	105	39	He spread a cloud for a covering, And fire to illumine by night.
Psalms	Psa	19	105	40	They asked, and He brought quail, And satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
Psalms	Psa	19	105	41	He opened the rock and water flowed out; It ran in the dry places like a river.
Psalms	Psa	19	105	42	For He remembered His holy word With Abraham His servant;
Psalms	Psa	19	105	43	And He brought forth His people with joy, His chosen ones with a joyful shout.
Psalms	Psa	19	105	44	He gave them also the lands of the nations, That they might take possession of the fruit of the peoples' labor,
Psalms	Psa	19	105	45	So that they might keep His statutes And observe His laws, Praise the LORD!
Psalms	Psa	19	106	1	Praise the LORD! Oh give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; For His lovingkindness is everlasting.
Psalms	Psa	19	106	2	Who can speak of the mighty deeds of the LORD, Or can show forth all His praise?
Psalms	Psa	19	106	3	How blessed are those who keep justice, Who practice righteousness at all times!
Psalms	Psa	19	106	4	Remember me, O LORD, in Your favor toward Your people; Visit me with Your salvation,
Psalms	Psa	19	106	5	That I may see the prosperity of Your chosen ones, That I may rejoice in the gladness of Your nation, That I may glory with Your inheritance.
Psalms	Psa	19	106	6	We have sinned like our fathers, We have committed iniquity, we have behaved wickedly.
Psalms	Psa	19	106	7	Our fathers in Egypt did not understand Your wonders; They did not remember Your abundant kindnesses, But rebelled by the sea, at the Red Sea.
Psalms	Psa	19	106	8	Nevertheless He saved them for the sake of His name, That He might make His power known.
Psalms	Psa	19	106	9	Thus He rebuked the Red Sea and it dried up, And He led them through the deeps, as through the wilderness.
Psalms	Psa	19	106	10	So He saved them from the hand of the one who hated them, And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
Psalms	Psa	19	106	11	The waters covered their adversaries; Not one of them was left.
Psalms	Psa	19	106	12	Then they believed His words; They sang His praise.
Psalms	Psa	19	106	13	They quickly forgot His works; They did not wait for His counsel,
Psalms	Psa	19	106	14	But craved intensely in the wilderness, And tempted God in the desert.
Psalms	Psa	19	106	15	So He gave them their request, But sent a wasting disease among them.
Psalms	Psa	19	106	16	When they became envious of Moses in the camp, And of Aaron, the holy one of the LORD,
Psalms	Psa	19	106	17	The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, And engulfed the company of Abiram.
Psalms	Psa	19	106	18	And a fire blazed up in their company; The flame consumed the wicked.
Psalms	Psa	19	106	19	They made a calf in Horeb And worshiped a molten image.
Psalms	Psa	19	106	20	Thus they exchanged their glory For the image of an ox that eats grass.
Psalms	Psa	19	106	21	They forgot God their Savior, Who had done great things in Egypt,
Psalms	Psa	19	106	22	Wonders in the land of Ham And awesome things by the Red Sea.
Psalms	Psa	19	106	23	Therefore He said that He would destroy them, Had not Moses His chosen one stood in the breach before Him, To turn away His wrath from destroying them.
Psalms	Psa	19	106	24	Then they despised the pleasant land; They did not believe in His word,
Psalms	Psa	19	106	25	But grumbled in their tents; They did not listen to the voice of the LORD.
Psalms	Psa	19	106	26	Therefore He swore to them That He would cast them down in the wilderness,
Psalms	Psa	19	106	27	And that He would cast their seed among the nations And scatter them in the lands.
Psalms	Psa	19	106	28	They joined themselves also to Baal-peor, And ate sacrifices offered to the dead.
Psalms	Psa	19	106	29	Thus they provoked Him to anger with their deeds, And the plague broke out among them.
Psalms	Psa	19	106	30	Then Phinehas stood up and interposed, And so the plague was stayed.
Psalms	Psa	19	106	31	And it was reckoned to him for righteousness, To all generations forever.
Psalms	Psa	19	106	32	They also provoked Him to wrath at the waters of Meribah, So that it went hard with Moses on their account;
Psalms	Psa	19	106	33	Because they were rebellious against His Spirit, He spoke rashly with his lips.
Psalms	Psa	19	106	34	They did not destroy the peoples, As the LORD commanded them,
Psalms	Psa	19	106	35	But they mingled with the nations And learned their practices,
Psalms	Psa	19	106	36	And served their idols, Which became a snare to them.
Psalms	Psa	19	106	37	They even sacrificed their sons and their daughters to the demons,
Psalms	Psa	19	106	38	And shed innocent blood, The blood of their sons and their daughters, Whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; And the land was polluted with the blood.
Psalms	Psa	19	106	39	Thus they became unclean in their practices, And played the harlot in their deeds.
Psalms	Psa	19	106	40	Therefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against His people And He abhorred His inheritance.
Psalms	Psa	19	106	41	Then He gave them into the hand of the nations, And those who hated them ruled over them.
Psalms	Psa	19	106	42	Their enemies also oppressed them, And they were subdued under their power.
Psalms	Psa	19	106	43	Many times He would deliver them; They, however, were rebellious in their counsel, And so sank down in their iniquity.
Psalms	Psa	19	106	44	Nevertheless He looked upon their distress When He heard their cry;
Psalms	Psa	19	106	45	And He remembered His covenant for their sake, And relented according to the greatness of His lovingkindness.
Psalms	Psa	19	106	46	He also made them objects of compassion In the presence of all their captors.
Psalms	Psa	19	106	47	Save us, O LORD our God, And gather us from among the nations, To give thanks to Your holy name And glory in Your praise.
Psalms	Psa	19	106	48	Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, From everlasting even to everlasting. And let all the people say, "Amen." Praise the LORD!
Psalms	Psa	19	107	1	Oh give thanks to the LORD, for He is good, For His lovingkindness is everlasting.
Psalms	Psa	19	107	2	Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, Whom He has redeemed from the hand of the adversary
Psalms	Psa	19	107	3	And gathered from the lands, From the east and from the west, From the north and from the south.
Psalms	Psa	19	107	4	They wandered in the wilderness in a desert region; They did not find a way to an inhabited city.
Psalms	Psa	19	107	5	They were hungry and thirsty; Their soul fainted within them.
Psalms	Psa	19	107	6	Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble; He delivered them out of their distresses.
Psalms	Psa	19	107	7	He led them also by a straight way, To go to an inhabited city.
Psalms	Psa	19	107	8	Let them give thanks to the LORD for His lovingkindness, And for His wonders to the sons of men!
Psalms	Psa	19	107	9	For He has satisfied the thirsty soul, And the hungry soul He has filled with what is good.
Psalms	Psa	19	107	10	There were those who dwelt in darkness and in the shadow of death, Prisoners in misery and chains,
Psalms	Psa	19	107	11	Because they had rebelled against the words of God And spurned the counsel of the Most High.
Psalms	Psa	19	107	12	Therefore He humbled their heart with labor; They stumbled and there was none to help.
Psalms	Psa	19	107	13	Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble; He saved them out of their distresses.
Psalms	Psa	19	107	14	He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death And broke their bands apart.
Psalms	Psa	19	107	15	Let them give thanks to the LORD for His lovingkindness, And for His wonders to the sons of men!
Psalms	Psa	19	107	16	For He has shattered gates of bronze And cut bars of iron asunder.
Psalms	Psa	19	107	17	Fools, because of their rebellious way, And because of their iniquities, were afflicted.
Psalms	Psa	19	107	18	Their soul abhorred all kinds of food, And they drew near to the gates of death.
Psalms	Psa	19	107	19	Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble; He saved them out of their distresses.
Psalms	Psa	19	107	20	He sent His word and healed them, And delivered them from their destructions.
Psalms	Psa	19	107	21	Let them give thanks to the LORD for His lovingkindness, And for His wonders to the sons of men!
Psalms	Psa	19	107	22	Let them also offer sacrifices of thanksgiving, And tell of His works with joyful singing.
Psalms	Psa	19	107	23	Those who go down to the sea in ships, Who do business on great waters;
Psalms	Psa	19	107	24	They have seen the works of the LORD, And His wonders in the deep.
Psalms	Psa	19	107	25	For He spoke and raised up a stormy wind, Which lifted up the waves of the sea.
Psalms	Psa	19	107	26	They rose up to the heavens, they went down to the depths; Their soul melted away in their misery.
Psalms	Psa	19	107	27	They reeled and staggered like a drunken man, And were at their wits' end.
Psalms	Psa	19	107	28	Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, And He brought them out of their distresses.
Psalms	Psa	19	107	29	He caused the storm to be still, So that the waves of the sea were hushed.
Psalms	Psa	19	107	30	Then they were glad because they were quiet, So He guided them to their desired haven.
Psalms	Psa	19	107	31	Let them give thanks to the LORD for His lovingkindness, And for His wonders to the sons of men!
Psalms	Psa	19	107	32	Let them extol Him also in the congregation of the people, And praise Him at the seat of the elders.
Psalms	Psa	19	107	33	He changes rivers into a wilderness And springs of water into a thirsty ground;
Psalms	Psa	19	107	34	A fruitful land into a salt waste, Because of the wickedness of those who dwell in it.
Psalms	Psa	19	107	35	He changes a wilderness into a pool of water And a dry land into springs of water;
Psalms	Psa	19	107	36	And there He makes the hungry to dwell, So that they may establish an inhabited city,
Psalms	Psa	19	107	37	And sow fields and plant vineyards, And gather a fruitful harvest.
Psalms	Psa	19	107	38	Also He blesses them and they multiply greatly, And He does not let their cattle decrease.
Psalms	Psa	19	107	39	When they are diminished and bowed down Through oppression, misery and sorrow,
Psalms	Psa	19	107	40	He pours contempt upon princes And makes them wander in a pathless waste.
Psalms	Psa	19	107	41	But He sets the needy securely on high away from affliction, And makes his families like a flock.
Psalms	Psa	19	107	42	The upright see it and are glad; But all unrighteousness shuts its mouth.
Psalms	Psa	19	107	43	Who is wise? Let him give heed to these things, And consider the lovingkindnesses of the LORD.
Psalms	Psa	19	108	1	My heart is steadfast, O God; I will sing, I will sing praises, even with my soul.
Psalms	Psa	19	108	2	Awake, harp and lyre; I will awaken the dawn!
Psalms	Psa	19	108	3	I will give thanks to You, O LORD, among the peoples, And I will sing praises to You among the nations.
Psalms	Psa	19	108	4	For Your lovingkindness is great above the heavens, And Your truth reaches to the skies.
Psalms	Psa	19	108	5	Be exalted, O God, above the heavens, And Your glory above all the earth.
Psalms	Psa	19	108	6	That Your beloved may be delivered, Save with Your right hand, and answer me!
Psalms	Psa	19	108	7	God has spoken in His holiness: "I will exult, I will portion out Shechem And measure out the valley of Succoth.
Psalms	Psa	19	108	8	"Gilead is Mine, Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim also is the helmet of My head; Judah is My scepter.
Psalms	Psa	19	108	9	"Moab is My washbowl; Over Edom I shall throw My shoe; Over Philistia I will shout aloud."
Psalms	Psa	19	108	10	Who will bring me into the besieged city? Who will lead me to Edom?
Psalms	Psa	19	108	11	Have not You Yourself, O God, rejected us? And will You not go forth with our armies, O God?
Psalms	Psa	19	108	12	Oh give us help against the adversary, For deliverance by man is in vain.
Psalms	Psa	19	108	13	Through God we will do valiantly, And it is He who shall tread down our adversaries.
Psalms	Psa	19	109	1	O God of my praise, Do not be silent!
Psalms	Psa	19	109	2	For they have opened the wicked and deceitful mouth against me; They have spoken against me with a lying tongue.
Psalms	Psa	19	109	3	They have also surrounded me with words of hatred, And fought against me without cause.
Psalms	Psa	19	109	4	In return for my love they act as my accusers; But I am in prayer.
Psalms	Psa	19	109	5	Thus they have repaid me evil for good And hatred for my love.
Psalms	Psa	19	109	6	Appoint a wicked man over him, And let an accuser stand at his right hand.
Psalms	Psa	19	109	7	When he is judged, let him come forth guilty, And let his prayer become sin.
Psalms	Psa	19	109	8	Let his days be few; Let another take his office.
Psalms	Psa	19	109	9	Let his children be fatherless And his wife a widow.
Psalms	Psa	19	109	10	Let his children wander about and beg; And let them seek sustenance far from their ruined homes.
Psalms	Psa	19	109	11	Let the creditor seize all that he has, And let strangers plunder the product of his labor.
Psalms	Psa	19	109	12	Let there be none to extend lovingkindness to him, Nor any to be gracious to his fatherless children.
Psalms	Psa	19	109	13	Let his posterity be cut off; In a following generation let their name be blotted out.
Psalms	Psa	19	109	14	Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the LORD, And do not let the sin of his mother be blotted out.
Psalms	Psa	19	109	15	Let them be before the LORD continually, That He may cut off their memory from the earth;
Psalms	Psa	19	109	16	Because he did not remember to show lovingkindness, But persecuted the afflicted and needy man, And the despondent in heart, to put them to death.
Psalms	Psa	19	109	17	He also loved cursing, so it came to him; And he did not delight in blessing, so it was far from him.
Psalms	Psa	19	109	18	But he clothed himself with cursing as with his garment, And it entered into his body like water And like oil into his bones.
Psalms	Psa	19	109	19	Let it be to him as a garment with which he covers himself, And for a belt with which he constantly girds himself.
Psalms	Psa	19	109	20	Let this be the reward of my accusers from the LORD, And of those who speak evil against my soul.
Psalms	Psa	19	109	21	But You, O GOD, the Lord, deal kindly with me for Your name's sake; Because Your lovingkindness is good, deliver me;
Psalms	Psa	19	109	22	For I am afflicted and needy, And my heart is wounded within me.
Psalms	Psa	19	109	23	I am passing like a shadow when it lengthens; I am shaken off like the locust.
Psalms	Psa	19	109	24	My knees are weak from fasting, And my flesh has grown lean, without fatness.
Psalms	Psa	19	109	25	I also have become a reproach to them; When they see me, they wag their head.

Psalms	Psa	19	129	6	Let them be like grass upon the housetops, Which withers before it grows up;
Psalms	Psa	19	129	7	With which the reaper does not fill his hand, Or the binder of sheaves his bosom;
Psalms	Psa	19	129	8	Nor do those who pass by say, "The blessing of the LORD be upon you; We bless you in the name of the LORD."
Psalms	Psa	19	130	1	Out of the depths I have cried to You, O LORD.

Psalms	Psa	19	131	3	O Israel, hope in the LORD From this time forth and forever.

Psalms	Psa	19	132	12	"If your sons will keep My covenant And My testimony which I will teach them, Their sons also shall sit upon your throne forever."
Psalms	Psa	19	132	13	For the LORD has chosen Zion; He has desired it for His habitation.

Psalms	Psa	19	139	13	For You formed my inward parts; You wove me in my mother's womb.
Psalms	Psa	19	139	14	I will give thanks to You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; Wonderful are Your works, And my soul knows it very well.
Psalms	Psa	19	139	15	My frame was not hidden from You, When I was made in secret, And skillfully wrought in the depths of the earth;
Psalms	Psa	19	139	16	Your eyes have seen my unformed substance; And in Your book were all written The days that were ordained for me, When as yet there was not one of them.
Psalms	Psa	19	139	17	How precious also are Your thoughts to me, O God! How vast is the sum of them!
Psalms	Psa	19	139	18	If I should count them, they would outnumber the sand. When I awake, I am still with You.
Psalms	Psa	19	139	19	O that You would slay the wicked, O God; Depart from me, therefore, men of bloodshed.
Psalms	Psa	19	139	20	For they speak against You wickedly, And Your enemies take Your name in vain.
Psalms	Psa	19	139	21	Do I not hate those who hate You, O LORD? And do I not loathe those who rise up against You?
Psalms	Psa	19	139	22	I hate them with the utmost hatred; They have become my enemies.
Psalms	Psa	19	139	23	Search me, O God, and know my heart; Try me and know my anxious thoughts;
Psalms	Psa	19	139	24	And see if there be any hurtful way in me, And lead me in the everlasting way.
Psalms	Psa	19	140	1	Rescue me, O LORD, from evil men; Preserve me from violent men
Psalms	Psa	19	140	2	Who devise evil things in their hearts; They continually stir up wars.
Psalms	Psa	19	140	3	They sharpen their tongues as a serpent; Poison of a viper is under their lips. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	140	4	Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; Preserve me from violent men Who have purposed to trip up my feet.
Psalms	Psa	19	140	5	The proud have hidden a trap for me, and cords; They have spread a net by the wayside; They have set snares for me. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	140	6	I said to the LORD, "You are my God; Give ear, O LORD, to the voice of my supplications.
Psalms	Psa	19	140	7	"O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, You have covered my head in the day of battle.
Psalms	Psa	19	140	8	"Do not grant, O LORD, the desires of the wicked; Do not promote his evil device, that they not be exalted. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	140	9	"As for the head of those who surround me, May the mischief of their lips cover them.
Psalms	Psa	19	140	10	"May burning coals fall upon them; May they be cast into the fire, Into deep pits from which they cannot rise.
Psalms	Psa	19	140	11	"May a slanderer not be established in the earth; May evil hunt the violent man speedily."
Psalms	Psa	19	140	12	I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted And justice for the poor.
Psalms	Psa	19	140	13	Surely the righteous will give thanks to Your name; The upright will dwell in Your presence.
Psalms	Psa	19	141	1	O LORD, I call upon You; hasten to me! Give ear to my voice when I call to You!
Psalms	Psa	19	141	2	May my prayer be counted as incense before You; The lifting up of my hands as the evening offering.
Psalms	Psa	19	141	3	Set a guard, O LORD, over my mouth; Keep watch over the door of my lips.
Psalms	Psa	19	141	4	Do not incline my heart to any evil thing, To practice deeds of wickedness With men who do iniquity; And do not let me eat of their delicacies.
Psalms	Psa	19	141	5	Let the righteous smite me in kindness and reprove me; It is oil upon the head; Do not let my head refuse it, For still my prayer is against their wicked deeds.
Psalms	Psa	19	141	6	Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock, And they hear my words, for they are pleasant.
Psalms	Psa	19	141	7	As when one plows and breaks open the earth, Our bones have been scattered at the mouth of Sheol.
Psalms	Psa	19	141	8	For my eyes are toward You, O GOD, the Lord; In You I take refuge; do not leave me defenseless.
Psalms	Psa	19	141	9	Keep me from the jaws of the trap which they have set for me, And from the snares of those who do iniquity.
Psalms	Psa	19	141	10	Let the wicked fall into their own nets, While I pass by safely.
Psalms	Psa	19	142	1	I cry aloud with my voice to the LORD; I make supplication with my voice to the LORD.
Psalms	Psa	19	142	2	I pour out my complaint before Him; I declare my trouble before Him.
Psalms	Psa	19	142	3	When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, You knew my path. In the way where I walk They have hidden a trap for me.
Psalms	Psa	19	142	4	Look to the right and see; For there is no one who regards me; There is no escape for me; No one cares for my soul.
Psalms	Psa	19	142	5	I cried out to You, O LORD; I said, "You are my refuge, My portion in the land of the living.
Psalms	Psa	19	142	6	"Give heed to my cry, For I am brought very low; Deliver me from my persecutors, For they are too strong for me.
Psalms	Psa	19	142	7	"Bring my soul out of prison, So that I may give thanks to Your name; The righteous will surround me, For You will deal bountifully with me."
Psalms	Psa	19	143	1	Hear my prayer, O LORD, Give ear to my supplications! Answer me in Your faithfulness, in Your righteousness!
Psalms	Psa	19	143	2	And do not enter into judgment with Your servant, For in Your sight no man living is righteous.
Psalms	Psa	19	143	3	For the enemy has persecuted my soul; He has crushed my life to the ground; He has made me dwell in dark places, like those who have long been dead.
Psalms	Psa	19	143	4	Therefore my spirit is overwhelmed within me; My heart is appalled within me.
Psalms	Psa	19	143	5	I remember the days of old; I meditate on all Your doings; I muse on the work of Your hands.
Psalms	Psa	19	143	6	I stretch out my hands to You; My soul longs for You, as a parched land. Selah.
Psalms	Psa	19	143	7	Answer me quickly, O LORD, my spirit fails; Do not hide Your face from me, Or I will become like those who go down to the pit.
Psalms	Psa	19	143	8	Let me hear Your lovingkindness in the morning; For I trust in You; Teach me the way in which I should walk; For to You I lift up my soul.
Psalms	Psa	19	143	9	Deliver me, O LORD, from my enemies; I take refuge in You.
Psalms	Psa	19	143	10	Teach me to do Your will, For You are my God; Let Your good Spirit lead me on level ground.
Psalms	Psa	19	143	11	For the sake of Your name, O LORD, revive me. In Your righteousness bring my soul out of trouble.

Psalms	Psa	19	144	3	O LORD, what is man, that You take knowledge of him? Or the son of man, that You think of him?
Psalms	Psa	19	144	4	Man is like a mere breath; His days are like a passing shadow.
Psalms	Psa	19	144	5	Bow Your heavens, O LORD, and come down; Touch the mountains, that they may smoke.
Psalms	Psa	19	144	6	Flash forth lightning and scatter them; Send out Your arrows and confuse them.
Psalms	Psa	19	144	7	Stretch forth Your hand from on high; Rescue me and deliver me out of great waters, Out of the hand of aliens
Psalms	Psa	19	144	8	Whose mouths speak deceit, And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
Psalms	Psa	19	144	9	I will sing a new song to You, O God; Upon a harp of ten strings I will sing praises to You,
Psalms	Psa	19	144	10	Who gives salvation to kings, Who rescues David His servant from the evil sword.
Psalms	Psa	19	144	11	Rescue me and deliver me out of the hand of aliens, Whose mouth speaks deceit And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.

Psalms	Psa	19	144	14	Let our cattle bear Without mishap and without loss, Let there be no outcry in our streets!
Psalms	Psa	19	144	15	How blessed are the people who are so situated; How blessed are the people whose God is the LORD!

Proverbs	Prv	20	1	1	The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel:
Proverbs	Prv	20	1	2	To know wisdom and instruction, To discern the sayings of understanding,
Proverbs	Prv	20	1	3	To receive instruction in wise behavior, Righteousness, justice and equity;
Proverbs	Prv	20	1	4	To give prudence to the naive, To the youth knowledge and discretion,
Proverbs	Prv	20	1	5	A wise man will hear and increase in learning, And a man of understanding will acquire wise counsel,
Proverbs	Prv	20	1	6	To understand a proverb and a figure, The words of the wise and their riddles.
Proverbs	Prv	20	1	7	The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; Fools despise wisdom and instruction.
Proverbs	Prv	20	1	8	Hear, my son, your father's instruction And do not forsake your mother's teaching;
Proverbs	Prv	20	1	9	Indeed, they are a graceful wreath to your head And ornaments about your neck.
Proverbs	Prv	20	1	10	My son, if sinners entice you, Do not consent.
Proverbs	Prv	20	1	11	If they say, "Come with us, Let us lie in wait for blood, Let us ambush the innocent without cause;
Proverbs	Prv	20	1	12	Let us swallow them alive like Sheol, Even whole, as those who go down to the pit;
Proverbs	Prv	20	1	13	We will find all kinds of precious wealth, We will fill our houses with spoil;
Proverbs	Prv	20	1	14	Throw in your lot with us, We shall all have one purse,"
Proverbs	Prv	20	1	15	My son, do not walk in the way with them. Keep your feet from their path,
Proverbs	Prv	20	1	16	For their feet run to evil And they hasten to shed blood.
Proverbs	Prv	20	1	17	Indeed, it is useless to spread the baited net In the sight of any bird;
Proverbs	Prv	20	1	18	But they lie in wait for their own blood; They ambush their own lives.
Proverbs	Prv	20	1	19	So are the ways of everyone who gains by violence; It takes away the life of its possessors.
Proverbs	Prv	20	1	20	Wisdom shouts in the street, She lifts her voice in the square;
Proverbs	Prv	20	1	21	At the head of the noisy streets she cries out; At the entrance of the gates in the city she utters her sayings:
Proverbs	Prv	20	1	22	"How long, O naive ones, will you love being simple-minded? And scoffers delight themselves in scoffing And fools hate knowledge?
Proverbs	Prv	20	1	23	"Turn to my reproof, Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you; I will make my words known to you.
Proverbs	Prv	20	1	24	"Because I called and you refused, I stretched out my hand and no one paid attention;
Proverbs	Prv	20	1	25	And you neglected all my counsel And did not want my reproof;
Proverbs	Prv	20	1	26	I will also laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your dread comes,
Proverbs	Prv	20	1	27	When your dread comes like a storm And your calamity comes like a whirlwind, When distress and anguish come upon you.
Proverbs	Prv	20	1	28	"Then they will call on me, but I will not answer; They will seek me diligently but they will not find me,
Proverbs	Prv	20	1	29	Because they hated knowledge And did not choose the fear of the LORD.
Proverbs	Prv	20	1	30	"They would not accept my counsel, They spurned all my reproof.
Proverbs	Prv	20	1	31	"So they shall eat of the fruit of their own way And be satiated with their own devices.
Proverbs	Prv	20	1	32	"For the waywardness of the naive will kill them, And the complacency of fools will destroy them.
Proverbs	Prv	20	1	33	"But he who listens to me shall live securely And will be at ease from the dread of evil."
Proverbs	Prv	20	2	1	My son, if you will receive my words And treasure my commandments within you,
Proverbs	Prv	20	2	2	Make your ear attentive to wisdom, Incline your heart to understanding;
Proverbs	Prv	20	2	3	For if you cry for discernment, Lift your voice for understanding;
Proverbs	Prv	20	2	4	If you seek her as silver And search for her as for hidden treasures;
Proverbs	Prv	20	2	5	Then you will discern the fear of the LORD And discover the knowledge of God.
Proverbs	Prv	20	2	6	For the LORD gives wisdom; From His mouth come knowledge and understanding.
Proverbs	Prv	20	2	7	He stores up sound wisdom for the upright; He is a shield to those who walk in integrity,
Proverbs	Prv	20	2	8	Guarding the paths of justice, And He preserves the way of His godly ones.
Proverbs	Prv	20	2	9	Then you will discern righteousness and justice And equity and every good course.
Proverbs	Prv	20	2	10	For wisdom will enter your heart And knowledge will be pleasant to your soul;
Proverbs	Prv	20	2	11	Discretion will guard you, Understanding will watch over you,
Proverbs	Prv	20	2	12	To deliver you from the way of evil, From the man who speaks perverse things;
Proverbs	Prv	20	2	13	From those who leave the paths of uprightness To walk in the ways of darkness;
Proverbs	Prv	20	2	14	Who delight in doing evil And rejoice in the perversity of evil;
Proverbs	Prv	20	2	15	Whose paths are crooked, And who are devious in their ways;
Proverbs	Prv	20	2	16	To deliver you from the strange woman, From the adulteress who flatters with her words;
Proverbs	Prv	20	2	17	That leaves the companion of her youth And forgets the covenant of her God;
Proverbs	Prv	20	2	18	For her house sinks down to death And her tracks lead to the dead;
Proverbs	Prv	20	2	19	None who go to her return again, Nor do they reach the paths of life.
Proverbs	Prv	20	2	20	So you will walk in the way of good men And keep to the paths of the righteous.
Proverbs	Prv	20	2	21	For the upright will live in the land And the blameless will remain in it;
Proverbs	Prv	20	2	22	But the wicked will be cut off from the land And the treacherous will be uprooted from it.
Proverbs	Prv	20	3	1	My son, do not forget my teaching, But let your heart keep my commandments;
Proverbs	Prv	20	3	2	For length of days and years of life And peace they will add to you.
Proverbs	Prv	20	3	3	Do not let kindness and truth leave you; Bind them around your neck, Write them on the tablet of your heart.
Proverbs	Prv	20	3	4	So you will find favor and good repute In the sight of God and man.
Proverbs	Prv	20	3	5	Trust in the LORD with all your heart And do not lean on your own understanding.
Proverbs	Prv	20	3	6	In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He will make your paths straight.
Proverbs	Prv	20	3	7	Do not be wise in your own eyes; Fear the LORD and turn away from evil.
Proverbs	Prv	20	3	8	It will be healing to your body And refreshment to your bones.
Proverbs	Prv	20	3	9	Honor the LORD from your wealth And from the first of all your produce;
Proverbs	Prv	20	3	10	So your barns will be filled with plenty And your vats will overflow with new wine.
Proverbs	Prv	20	3	11	My son, do not reject the discipline of the LORD Or loathe His reproof,
Proverbs	Prv	20	3	12	For whom the LORD loves He reproves, Even as a father corrects the son in whom he delights.
Proverbs	Prv	20	3	13	How blessed is the man who finds wisdom And the man who gains understanding.
Proverbs	Prv	20	3	14	For her profit is better than the profit of silver And her gain better than fine gold.
Proverbs	Prv	20	3	15	She is more precious than jewels; And nothing you desire compares with her.
Proverbs	Prv	20	3	16	Long life is in her right hand; In her left hand are riches and honor.
Proverbs	Prv	20	3	17	Her ways are pleasant ways And all her paths are peace.
Proverbs	Prv	20	3	18	She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her, And happy are all who hold her fast.
Proverbs	Prv	20	3	19	The LORD by wisdom founded the earth, By understanding He established the heavens.
Proverbs	Prv	20	3	20	By His knowledge the deeps were broken up And the skies drip with dew.
Proverbs	Prv	20	3	21	My son, let them not vanish from your sight; Keep sound wisdom and discretion,
Proverbs	Prv	20	3	22	So they will be life to your soul And adornment to your neck.
Proverbs	Prv	20	3	23	Then you will walk in your way securely And your foot will not stumble.
Proverbs	Prv	20	3	24	When you lie down, you will not be afraid; When you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.
Proverbs	Prv	20	3	25	Do not be afraid of sudden fear Nor of the onslaught of the wicked when it comes;
Proverbs	Prv	20	3	26	For the LORD will be your confidence And will keep your foot from being caught.
Proverbs	Prv	20	3	27	Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, When it is in your power to do it.
Proverbs	Prv	20	3	28	Do not say to your neighbor, "Go, and come back, And tomorrow I will give it," When you have it with you.
Proverbs	Prv	20	3	29	Do not devise harm against your neighbor, While he lives securely beside you.
Proverbs	Prv	20	3	30	Do not contend with a man without cause, If he has done you no harm.
Proverbs	Prv	20	3	31	Do not envy a man of violence And do not choose any of his ways.
Proverbs	Prv	20	3	32	For the devious are an abomination to the LORD; But He is intimate with the upright.
Proverbs	Prv	20	3	33	The curse of the LORD is on the house of the wicked, But He blesses the dwelling of the righteous.
Proverbs	Prv	20	3	34	Though He scoffs at the scoffers, Yet He gives grace to the afflicted.
Proverbs	Prv	20	3	35	The wise will inherit honor, But fools display dishonor.
Proverbs	Prv	20	4	1	Hear, O sons, the instruction of a father, And give attention that you may gain understanding,
Proverbs	Prv	20	4	2	For I give you sound teaching; Do not abandon my instruction.
Proverbs	Prv	20	4	3	When I was a son to my father, Tender and the only son in the sight of my mother,
Proverbs	Prv	20	4	4	Then he taught me and said to me, "Let your heart hold fast my words; Keep my commandments and live;
Proverbs	Prv	20	4	5	Acquire wisdom! Acquire understanding! Do not forget nor turn away from the words of my mouth.
Proverbs	Prv	20	4	6	"Do not forsake her, and she will guard you; Love her, and she will watch over you.
Proverbs	Prv	20	4	7	"The beginning of wisdom is: Acquire wisdom; And with all your acquiring, get understanding.
Proverbs	Prv	20	4	8	"Prize her, and she will exalt you; She will honor you if you embrace her.
Proverbs	Prv	20	4	9	"She will place on your head a garland of grace; She will present you with a crown of beauty."
Proverbs	Prv	20	4	10	Hear, my son, and accept my sayings And the years of your life will be many.
Proverbs	Prv	20	4	11	I have directed you in the way of wisdom; I have led you in upright paths.
Proverbs	Prv	20	4	12	When you walk, your steps will not be impeded; And if you run, you will not stumble.
Proverbs	Prv	20	4	13	Take hold of instruction; do not let go. Guard her, for she is your life.
Proverbs	Prv	20	4	14	Do not enter the path of the wicked And do not proceed in the way of evil men.
Proverbs	Prv	20	4	15	Avoid it, do not pass by it; Turn away from it and pass on.
Proverbs	Prv	20	4	16	For they cannot sleep unless they do evil; And they are robbed of sleep unless they make someone stumble.
Proverbs	Prv	20	4	17	For they eat the bread of wickedness And drink the wine of violence.
Proverbs	Prv	20	4	18	But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, That shines brighter and brighter until the full day.
Proverbs	Prv	20	4	19	The way of the wicked is like darkness; They do not know over what they stumble.
Proverbs	Prv	20	4	20	My son, give attention to my words; Incline your ear to my sayings.
Proverbs	Prv	20	4	21	Do not let them depart from your sight; Keep them in the midst of your heart.
Proverbs	Prv	20	4	22	For they are life to those who find them And health to all their body.
Proverbs	Prv	20	4	23	Watch over your heart with all diligence, For from it flow the springs of life.
Proverbs	Prv	20	4	24	Put away from you a deceitful mouth And put devious speech far from you.
Proverbs	Prv	20	4	25	Let your eyes look directly ahead And let your gaze be fixed straight in front of you.
Proverbs	Prv	20	4	26	Watch the path of your feet And all your ways will be established.
Proverbs	Prv	20	4	27	Do not turn to the right nor to the left; Turn your foot from evil.
Proverbs	Prv	20	5	1	My son, give attention to my wisdom, Incline your ear to my understanding;
Proverbs	Prv	20	5	2	That you may observe discretion And your lips may reserve knowledge.
Proverbs	Prv	20	5	3	For the lips of an adulteress drip honey And smoother than oil is her speech;
Proverbs	Prv	20	5	4	But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a two-edged sword.
Proverbs	Prv	20	5	5	Her feet go down to death, Her steps take hold of Sheol.
Proverbs	Prv	20	5	6	She does not ponder the path of life; Her ways are unstable, she does not know it.
Proverbs	Prv	20	5	7	Now then, my sons, listen to me And do not depart from the words of my mouth.
Proverbs	Prv	20	5	8	Keep your way far from her And do not go near the door of her house,
Proverbs	Prv	20	5	9	Or you will give your vigor to others And your years to the cruel one;
Proverbs	Prv	20	5	10	And strangers will be filled with your strength And your hard-earned goods will go to the house of an alien;
Proverbs	Prv	20	5	11	And you groan at your final end, When your flesh and your body are consumed;
Proverbs	Prv	20	5	12	And you say, "How I have hated instruction! And my heart spurned reproof!
Proverbs	Prv	20	5	13	"I have not listened to the voice of my teachers, Nor inclined my ear to my instructors!
Proverbs	Prv	20	5	14	"I was almost in utter ruin In the midst of the assembly and congregation."
Proverbs	Prv	20	5	15	Drink water from your own cistern And fresh water from your own well.
Proverbs	Prv	20	5	16	Should your springs be dispersed abroad, Streams of water in the streets?
Proverbs	Prv	20	5	17	Let them be yours alone And not for strangers with you.
Proverbs	Prv	20	5	18	Let your fountain be blessed, And rejoice in the wife of your youth.
Proverbs	Prv	20	5	19	As a loving hind and a graceful doe, Let her breasts satisfy you at all times; Be exhilarated always with her love.
Proverbs	Prv	20	5	20	For why should you, my son, be exhilarated with an adulteress And embrace the bosom of a foreigner?
Proverbs	Prv	20	5	21	For the ways of a man are before the eyes of the LORD, And He watches all his paths.
Proverbs	Prv	20	5	22	His own iniquities will capture the wicked, And he will be held with the cords of his sin.
Proverbs	Prv	20	5	23	He will die for lack of instruction, And in the greatness of his folly he will go astray.
Proverbs	Prv	20	6	1	My son, if you have become surety for your neighbor, Have given a pledge for a stranger,
Proverbs	Prv	20	6	2	If you have been snared with the words of your mouth, Have been caught with the words of your mouth,
Proverbs	Prv	20	6	3	Do this then, my son, and deliver yourself; Since you have come into the hand of your neighbor, Go, humble yourself, and importune your neighbor.
Proverbs	Prv	20	6	4	Give no sleep to your eyes, Nor slumber to your eyelids;
Proverbs	Prv	20	6	5	Deliver yourself like a gazelle from the hunter's hand And like a bird from the hand of the fowler.
Proverbs	Prv	20	6	6	Go to the ant, O sluggard, Observe her ways and be wise,
Proverbs	Prv	20	6	7	Which, having no chief, Officer or ruler,
Proverbs	Prv	20	6	8	Prepares her food in the summer And gathers her provision in the harvest.
Proverbs	Prv	20	6	9	How long will you lie down, O sluggard? When will you arise from your sleep?
Proverbs	Prv	20	6	10	"A little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to rest"--
Proverbs	Prv	20	6	11	Your poverty will come in like a vagabond And your need like an armed man.
Proverbs	Prv	20	6	12	A worthless person, a wicked man, Is the one who walks with a perverse mouth,
Proverbs	Prv	20	6	13	Who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet, Who points with his fingers;
Proverbs	Prv	20	6	14	Who with perversity in his heart continually devises evil, Who spreads strife.
Proverbs	Prv	20	6	15	Therefore his calamity will come suddenly; Instantly he will be broken and there will be no healing.
Proverbs	Prv	20	6	16	There are six things which the LORD hates, Yes, seven which are an abomination to Him:
Proverbs	Prv	20	6	17	Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, And hands that shed innocent blood,
Proverbs	Prv	20	6	18	A heart that devises wicked plans, Feet that run rapidly to evil,
Proverbs	Prv	20	6	19	A false witness who utters lies, And one who spreads strife among brothers.
Proverbs	Prv	20	6	20	My son, observe the commandment of your father And do not forsake the teaching of your mother;
Proverbs	Prv	20	6	21	Bind them continually on your heart; Tie them around your neck.
Proverbs	Prv	20	6	22	When you walk about, they will guide you; When you sleep, they will watch over you; And when you awake, they will talk to you.
Proverbs	Prv	20	6	23	For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching is light; And reproofs for discipline are the way of life
Proverbs	Prv	20	6	24	To keep you from the evil woman, From the smooth tongue of the adulteress.
Proverbs	Prv	20	6	25	Do not desire her beauty in your heart, Nor let her capture you with her eyelids.
Proverbs	Prv	20	6	26	For on account of a harlot one is reduced to a loaf of bread, And an adulteress hunts for the precious life.
Proverbs	Prv	20	6	27	Can a man take fire in his bosom And his clothes not be burned?
Proverbs	Prv	20	6	28	Or can a man walk on hot coals And his feet not be scorched?
Proverbs	Prv	20	6	29	So is the one who goes in to his neighbor's wife; Whoever touches her will not go unpunished.
Proverbs	Prv	20	6	30	Men do not despise a thief if he steals To satisfy himself when he is hungry;
Proverbs	Prv	20	6	31	But when he is found, he must repay sevenfold; He must give all the substance of his house.
Proverbs	Prv	20	6	32	The one who commits adultery with a woman is lacking sense; He who would destroy himself does it.
Proverbs	Prv	20	6	33	Wounds and disgrace he will find, And his reproach will not be blotted out.
Proverbs	Prv	20	6	34	For jealousy enrages a man, And he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
Proverbs	Prv	20	6	35	He will not accept any ransom, Nor will he be satisfied though you give many gifts.
Proverbs	Prv	20	7	1	My son, keep my words And treasure my commandments within you.
Proverbs	Prv	20	7	2	Keep my commandments and live, And my teaching as the apple of your eye.
Proverbs	Prv	20	7	3	Bind them on your fingers; Write them on the tablet of your heart.
Proverbs	Prv	20	7	4	Say to wisdom, "You are my sister," And call understanding your intimate friend;
Proverbs	Prv	20	7	5	That they may keep you from an adulteress, From the foreigner who flatters with her words.
Proverbs	Prv	20	7	6	For at the window of my house I looked out through my lattice,
Proverbs	Prv	20	7	7	And I saw among the naive, And discerned among the youths A young man lacking sense,
Proverbs	Prv	20	7	8	Passing through the street near her corner; And he takes the way to her house,
Proverbs	Prv	20	7	9	In the twilight, in the evening, In the middle of the night and in the darkness.
Proverbs	Prv	20	7	10	And behold, a woman comes to meet him, Dressed as a harlot and cunning of heart.
Proverbs	Prv	20	7	11	She is boisterous and rebellious, Her feet do not remain at home;
Proverbs	Prv	20	7	12	She is now in the streets, now in the squares, And lurks by every corner.
Proverbs	Prv	20	7	13	So she seizes him and kisses him And with a brazen face she says to him:
Proverbs	Prv	20	7	14	"I was due to offer peace offerings; Today I have paid my vows.
Proverbs	Prv	20	7	15	"Therefore I have come out to meet you, To seek your presence earnestly, and I have found you.
Proverbs	Prv	20	7	16	"I have spread my couch with coverings, With colored linens of Egypt.
Proverbs	Prv	20	7	17	"I have sprinkled my bed With myrrh, aloes and cinnamon.
Proverbs	Prv	20	7	18	"Come, let us drink our fill of love until morning; Let us delight ourselves with caresses.
Proverbs	Prv	20	7	19	"For my husband is not at home, He has gone on a long journey;
Proverbs	Prv	20	7	20	He has taken a bag of money with him, At the full moon he will come home."
Proverbs	Prv	20	7	21	With her many persuasions she entices him; With her flattering lips she seduces him.
Proverbs	Prv	20	7	22	Suddenly he follows her As an ox goes to the slaughter, Or as one in fetters to the discipline of a fool,
Proverbs	Prv	20	7	23	Until an arrow pierces through his liver; As a bird hastens to the snare, So he does not know that it will cost him his life.
Proverbs	Prv	20	7	24	Now therefore, my sons, listen to me, And pay attention to the words of my mouth.
Proverbs	Prv	20	7	25	Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways, Do not stray into her paths.
Proverbs	Prv	20	7	26	For many are the victims she has cast down, And numerous are all her slain.
Proverbs	Prv	20	7	27	Her house is the way to Sheol, Descending to the chambers of death.
Proverbs	Prv	20	8	1	Does not wisdom call, And understanding lift up her voice?
Proverbs	Prv	20	8	2	On top of the heights beside the way, Where the paths meet, she takes her stand;
Proverbs	Prv	20	8	3	Beside the gates, at the opening to the city, At the entrance of the doors, she cries out:
Proverbs	Prv	20	8	4	"To you, O men, I call, And my voice is to the sons of men.
Proverbs	Prv	20	8	5	"O naive ones, understand prudence; And, O fools, understand wisdom.
Proverbs	Prv	20	8	6	"Listen, for I will speak noble things; And the opening of my lips will reveal right things.
Proverbs	Prv	20	8	7	"For my mouth will utter truth; And wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
Proverbs	Prv	20	8	8	"All the utterances of my mouth are in righteousness; There is nothing crooked or perverted in them.
Proverbs	Prv	20	8	9	"They are all straightforward to him who understands, And right to those who find knowledge.
Proverbs	Prv	20	8	10	"Take my instruction and not silver, And knowledge rather than choicest gold.
Proverbs	Prv	20	8	11	"For wisdom is better than jewels; And all desirable things cannot compare with her.
Proverbs	Prv	20	8	12	"I, wisdom, dwell with prudence, And I find knowledge and discretion.
Proverbs	Prv	20	8	13	"The fear of the LORD is to hate evil; Pride and arrogance and the evil way And the perverted mouth, I hate.
Proverbs	Prv	20	8	14	"Counsel is mine and sound wisdom; I am understanding, power is mine.
Proverbs	Prv	20	8	15	"By me kings reign, And rulers decree justice.
Proverbs	Prv	20	8	16	"By me princes rule, and nobles, All who judge rightly.
Proverbs	Prv	20	8	17	"I love those who love me; And those who diligently seek me will find me.
Proverbs	Prv	20	8	18	"Riches and honor are with me, Enduring wealth and righteousness.
Proverbs	Prv	20	8	19	"My fruit is better than gold, even pure gold, And my yield better than choicest silver.
Proverbs	Prv	20	8	20	"I walk in the way of righteousness, In the midst of the paths of justice,
Proverbs	Prv	20	8	21	To endow those who love me with wealth, That I may fill their treasuries.
Proverbs	Prv	20	8	22	"The LORD possessed me at the beginning of His way, Before His works of old.
Proverbs	Prv	20	8	23	"From everlasting I was established, From the beginning, from the earliest times of the earth.
Proverbs	Prv	20	8	24	"When there were no depths I was brought forth, When there were no springs abounding with water.
Proverbs	Prv	20	8	25	"Before the mountains were settled, Before the hills I was brought forth;
Proverbs	Prv	20	8	26	While He had not yet made the earth and the fields, Nor the first dust of the world.
Proverbs	Prv	20	8	27	"When He established the heavens, I was there, When He inscribed a circle on the face of the deep,
Proverbs	Prv	20	8	28	When He made firm the skies above, When the springs of the deep became fixed,
Proverbs	Prv	20	8	29	When He set for the sea its boundary So that the water would not transgress His command, When He marked out the foundations of the earth;
Proverbs	Prv	20	8	30	Then I was beside Him, as a master workman; And I was daily His delight, Rejoicing always before Him,
Proverbs	Prv	20	8	31	Rejoicing in the world, His earth, And having my delight in the sons of men.
Proverbs	Prv	20	8	32	"Now therefore, O sons, listen to me, For blessed are they who keep my ways.
Proverbs	Prv	20	8	33	"Heed instruction and be wise, And do not neglect it.
Proverbs	Prv	20	8	34	"Blessed is the man who listens to me, Watching daily at my gates, Waiting at my doorposts.
Proverbs	Prv	20	8	35	"For he who finds me finds life And obtains favor from the LORD.
Proverbs	Prv	20	8	36	"But he who sins against me injures himself; All those who hate me love death."
Proverbs	Prv	20	9	1	Wisdom has built her house, She has hewn out her seven pillars;
Proverbs	Prv	20	9	2	She has prepared her food, she has mixed her wine; She has also set her table;
Proverbs	Prv	20	9	3	She has sent out her maidens, she calls From the tops of the heights of the city:
Proverbs	Prv	20	9	4	"Whoever is naive, let him turn in here!" To him who lacks understanding she says,
Proverbs	Prv	20	9	5	"Come, eat of my food And drink of the wine I have mixed.
Proverbs	Prv	20	9	6	"Forsake your folly and live, And proceed in the way of understanding."
Proverbs	Prv	20	9	7	He who corrects a scoffer gets dishonor for himself, And he who reproves a wicked man gets insults for himself.
Proverbs	Prv	20	9	8	Do not reprove a scoffer, or he will hate you, Reprove a wise man and he will love you.
Proverbs	Prv	20	9	9	Give instruction to a wise man and he will be still wiser, Teach a righteous man and he will increase his learning.

Proverbs	Prv	20	9	12	If you are wise, you are wise for yourself, And if you scoff, you alone will bear it.
Proverbs	Prv	20	9	13	The woman of folly is boisterous, She is naive and knows nothing.
Proverbs	Prv	20	9	14	She sits at the doorway of her house, On a seat by the high places of the city,
Proverbs	Prv	20	9	15	Calling to those who pass by, Who are making their paths straight:
Proverbs	Prv	20	9	16	"Whoever is naive, let him turn in here," And to him who lacks understanding she says,
Proverbs	Prv	20	9	17	"Stolen water is sweet; And bread eaten in secret is pleasant."
Proverbs	Prv	20	9	18	But he does not know that the dead are there, That her guests are in the depths of Sheol.

Proverbs	Prv	20	28	8	He who increases his wealth by interest and usury Gathers it for him who is gracious to the poor.
Proverbs	Prv	20	28	9	He who turns away his ear from listening to the law, Even his prayer is an abomination.
Proverbs	Prv	20	28	10	He who leads the upright astray in an evil way Will himself fall into his own pit, But the blameless will inherit good.
Proverbs	Prv	20	28	11	The rich man is wise in his own eyes, But the poor who has understanding sees through him.
Proverbs	Prv	20	28	12	When the righteous triumph, there is great glory, But when the wicked rise, men hide themselves.

Proverbs	Prv	20	28	23	He who rebukes a man will afterward find more favor Than he who flatters with the tongue.
Proverbs	Prv	20	28	24	He who robs his father or his mother And says, "It is not a transgression," Is the companion of a man who destroys.
Proverbs	Prv	20	28	25	An arrogant man stirs up strife, But he who trusts in the LORD will prosper.

Proverbs	Prv	20	29	14	If a king judges the poor with truth, His throne will be established forever.

Proverbs	Prv	20	30	1	The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, the oracle. The man declares to Ithiel, to Ithiel and Ucal:
Proverbs	Prv	20	30	2	Surely I am more stupid than any man, And I do not have the understanding of a man.
Proverbs	Prv	20	30	3	Neither have I learned wisdom, Nor do I have the knowledge of the Holy One.
Proverbs	Prv	20	30	4	Who has ascended into heaven and descended? Who has gathered the wind in His fists? Who has wrapped the waters in His garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is His name or His son's name? Surely you know!
Proverbs	Prv	20	30	5	Every word of God is tested; He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him.
Proverbs	Prv	20	30	6	Do not add to His words Or He will reprove you, and you will be proved a liar.
Proverbs	Prv	20	30	7	Two things I asked of You, Do not refuse me before I die:
Proverbs	Prv	20	30	8	Keep deception and lies far from me, Give me neither poverty nor riches; Feed me with the food that is my portion,
Proverbs	Prv	20	30	9	That I not be full and deny You and say, "Who is the LORD?" Or that I not be in want and steal, And profane the name of my God.
Proverbs	Prv	20	30	10	Do not slander a slave to his master, Or he will curse you and you will be found guilty.
Proverbs	Prv	20	30	11	There is a kind of man who curses his father And does not bless his mother.
Proverbs	Prv	20	30	12	There is a kind who is pure in his own eyes, Yet is not washed from his filthiness.
Proverbs	Prv	20	30	13	There is a kind--oh how lofty are his eyes! And his eyelids are raised in arrogance.
Proverbs	Prv	20	30	14	There is a kind of man whose teeth are like swords And his jaw teeth like knives, To devour the afflicted from the earth And the needy from among men.
Proverbs	Prv	20	30	15	The leech has two daughters, "Give," "Give." There are three things that will not be satisfied, Four that will not say, "Enough":
Proverbs	Prv	20	30	16	Sheol, and the barren womb, Earth that is never satisfied with water, And fire that never says, "Enough."
Proverbs	Prv	20	30	17	The eye that mocks a father And scorns a mother, The ravens of the valley will pick it out, And the young eagles will eat it.
Proverbs	Prv	20	30	18	There are three things which are too wonderful for me, Four which I do not understand:
Proverbs	Prv	20	30	19	The way of an eagle in the sky, The way of a serpent on a rock, The way of a ship in the middle of the sea, And the way of a man with a maid.
Proverbs	Prv	20	30	20	This is the way of an adulterous woman: She eats and wipes her mouth, And says, "I have done no wrong."
Proverbs	Prv	20	30	21	Under three things the earth quakes, And under four, it cannot bear up:
Proverbs	Prv	20	30	22	Under a slave when he becomes king, And a fool when he is satisfied with food,
Proverbs	Prv	20	30	23	Under an unloved woman when she gets a husband, And a maidservant when she supplants her mistress.
Proverbs	Prv	20	30	24	Four things are small on the earth, But they are exceedingly wise:
Proverbs	Prv	20	30	25	The ants are not a strong people, But they prepare their food in the summer;
Proverbs	Prv	20	30	26	The shephanim are not mighty people, Yet they make their houses in the rocks;
Proverbs	Prv	20	30	27	The locusts have no king, Yet all of them go out in ranks;
Proverbs	Prv	20	30	28	The lizard you may grasp with the hands, Yet it is in kings' palaces.
Proverbs	Prv	20	30	29	There are three things which are stately in their march, Even four which are stately when they walk:
Proverbs	Prv	20	30	30	The lion which is mighty among beasts And does not retreat before any,
Proverbs	Prv	20	30	31	The strutting rooster, the male goat also, And a king when his army is with him.
Proverbs	Prv	20	30	32	If you have been foolish in exalting yourself Or if you have plotted evil, put your hand on your mouth.
Proverbs	Prv	20	30	33	For the churning of milk produces butter, And pressing the nose brings forth blood; So the churning of anger produces strife.
Proverbs	Prv	20	31	1	The words of King Lemuel, the oracle which his mother taught him:
Proverbs	Prv	20	31	2	What, O my son? And what, O son of my womb? And what, O son of my vows?
Proverbs	Prv	20	31	3	Do not give your strength to women, Or your ways to that which destroys kings.
Proverbs	Prv	20	31	4	It is not for kings, O Lemuel, It is not for kings to drink wine, Or for rulers to desire strong drink,
Proverbs	Prv	20	31	5	For they will drink and forget what is decreed, And pervert the rights of all the afflicted.
Proverbs	Prv	20	31	6	Give strong drink to him who is perishing, And wine to him whose life is bitter.
Proverbs	Prv	20	31	7	Let him drink and forget his poverty And remember his trouble no more.
Proverbs	Prv	20	31	8	Open your mouth for the mute, For the rights of all the unfortunate.
Proverbs	Prv	20	31	9	Open your mouth, judge righteously, And defend the rights of the afflicted and needy.
Proverbs	Prv	20	31	10	An excellent wife, who can find? For her worth is far above jewels.
Proverbs	Prv	20	31	11	The heart of her husband trusts in her, And he will have no lack of gain.
Proverbs	Prv	20	31	12	She does him good and not evil All the days of her life.
Proverbs	Prv	20	31	13	She looks for wool and flax And works with her hands in delight.
Proverbs	Prv	20	31	14	She is like merchant ships; She brings her food from afar.
Proverbs	Prv	20	31	15	She rises also while it is still night And gives food to her household And portions to her maidens.
Proverbs	Prv	20	31	16	She considers a field and buys it; From her earnings she plants a vineyard.
Proverbs	Prv	20	31	17	She girds herself with strength And makes her arms strong.
Proverbs	Prv	20	31	18	She senses that her gain is good; Her lamp does not go out at night.
Proverbs	Prv	20	31	19	She stretches out her hands to the distaff, And her hands grasp the spindle.
Proverbs	Prv	20	31	20	She extends her hand to the poor, And she stretches out her hands to the needy.
Proverbs	Prv	20	31	21	She is not afraid of the snow for her household, For all her household are clothed with scarlet.
Proverbs	Prv	20	31	22	She makes coverings for herself; Her clothing is fine linen and purple.
Proverbs	Prv	20	31	23	Her husband is known in the gates, When he sits among the elders of the land.
Proverbs	Prv	20	31	24	She makes linen garments and sells them, And supplies belts to the tradesmen.
Proverbs	Prv	20	31	25	Strength and dignity are her clothing, And she smiles at the future.
Proverbs	Prv	20	31	26	She opens her mouth in wisdom, And the teaching of kindness is on her tongue.
Proverbs	Prv	20	31	27	She looks well to the ways of her household, And does not eat the bread of idleness.
Proverbs	Prv	20	31	28	Her children rise up and bless her; Her husband also, and he praises her, saying:
Proverbs	Prv	20	31	29	"Many daughters have done nobly, But you excel them all."
Proverbs	Prv	20	31	30	Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain, But a woman who fears the LORD, she shall be praised.
Proverbs	Prv	20	31	31	Give her the product of her hands, And let her works praise her in the gates.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	1	1	The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	1	2	"Vanity of vanities," says the Preacher, "Vanity of vanities! All is vanity."
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	1	3	What advantage does man have in all his work Which he does under the sun?
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	1	4	A generation goes and a generation comes, But the earth remains forever.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	1	5	Also, the sun rises and the sun sets; And hastening to its place it rises there again.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	1	6	Blowing toward the south, Then turning toward the north, The wind continues swirling along; And on its circular courses the wind returns.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	1	7	All the rivers flow into the sea, Yet the sea is not full. To the place where the rivers flow, There they flow again.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	1	8	All things are wearisome; Man is not able to tell it. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, Nor is the ear filled with hearing.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	1	9	That which has been is that which will be, And that which has been done is that which will be done. So there is nothing new under the sun.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	1	10	Is there anything of which one might say, "See this, it is new"? Already it has existed for ages Which were before us.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	1	11	There is no remembrance of earlier things; And also of the later things which will occur, There will be for them no remembrance Among those who will come later still.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	1	12	I, the Preacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	1	13	And I set my mind to seek and explore by wisdom concerning all that has been done under heaven. It is a grievous task which God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	1	14	I have seen all the works which have been done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	1	15	What is crooked cannot be straightened and what is lacking cannot be counted.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	1	16	I said to myself, "Behold, I have magnified and increased wisdom more than all who were over Jerusalem before me; and my mind has observed a wealth of wisdom and knowledge."
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	1	17	And I set my mind to know wisdom and to know madness and folly; I realized that this also is striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	1	18	Because in much wisdom there is much grief, and increasing knowledge results in increasing pain.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	2	1	I said to myself, "Come now, I will test you with pleasure. So enjoy yourself." And behold, it too was futility.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	2	2	I said of laughter, "It is madness," and of pleasure, "What does it accomplish?"
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	2	3	I explored with my mind how to stimulate my body with wine while my mind was guiding me wisely, and how to take hold of folly, until I could see what good there is for the sons of men to do under heaven the few years of their lives.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	2	4	I enlarged my works: I built houses for myself, I planted vineyards for myself;
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	2	5	I made gardens and parks for myself and I planted in them all kinds of fruit trees;
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	2	6	I made ponds of water for myself from which to irrigate a forest of growing trees.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	2	7	I bought male and female slaves and I had homeborn slaves. Also I possessed flocks and herds larger than all who preceded me in Jerusalem.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	2	8	Also, I collected for myself silver and gold and the treasure of kings and provinces. I provided for myself male and female singers and the pleasures of men--many concubines.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	2	9	Then I became great and increased more than all who preceded me in Jerusalem. My wisdom also stood by me.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	2	10	All that my eyes desired I did not refuse them. I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure, for my heart was pleased because of all my labor and this was my reward for all my labor.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	2	11	Thus I considered all my activities which my hands had done and the labor which I had exerted, and behold all was vanity and striving after wind and there was no profit under the sun.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	2	12	So I turned to consider wisdom, madness and folly; for what will the man do who will come after the king except what has already been done?
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	2	13	And I saw that wisdom excels folly as light excels darkness.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	2	14	The wise man's eyes are in his head, but the fool walks in darkness. And yet I know that one fate befalls them both.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	2	15	Then I said to myself, "As is the fate of the fool, it will also befall me. Why then have I been extremely wise?" So I said to myself, "This too is vanity."
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	2	16	For there is no lasting remembrance of the wise man as with the fool, inasmuch as in the coming days all will be forgotten. And how the wise man and the fool alike die!
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	2	17	So I hated life, for the work which had been done under the sun was grievous to me; because everything is futility and striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	2	18	Thus I hated all the fruit of my labor for which I had labored under the sun, for I must leave it to the man who will come after me.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	2	19	And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have control over all the fruit of my labor for which I have labored by acting wisely under the sun. This too is vanity.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	2	20	Therefore I completely despaired of all the fruit of my labor for which I had labored under the sun.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	2	21	When there is a man who has labored with wisdom, knowledge and skill, then he gives his legacy to one who has not labored with them. This too is vanity and a great evil.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	2	22	For what does a man get in all his labor and in his striving with which he labors under the sun?
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	2	23	Because all his days his task is painful and grievous; even at night his mind does not rest. This too is vanity.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	2	24	There is nothing better for a man than to eat and drink and tell himself that his labor is good. This also I have seen that it is from the hand of God.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	2	25	For who can eat and who can have enjoyment without Him?
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	2	26	For to a person who is good in His sight He has given wisdom and knowledge and joy, while to the sinner He has given the task of gathering and collecting so that he may give to one who is good in God's sight. This too is vanity and striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	3	1	There is an appointed time for everything. And there is a time for every event under heaven--
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	3	2	A time to give birth and a time to die; A time to plant and a time to uproot what is planted.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	3	3	A time to kill and a time to heal; A time to tear down and a time to build up.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	3	4	A time to weep and a time to laugh; A time to mourn and a time to dance.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	3	5	A time to throw stones and a time to gather stones; A time to embrace and a time to shun embracing.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	3	6	A time to search and a time to give up as lost; A time to keep and a time to throw away.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	3	7	A time to tear apart and a time to sew together; A time to be silent and a time to speak.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	3	8	A time to love and a time to hate; A time for war and a time for peace.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	3	9	What profit is there to the worker from that in which he toils?
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	3	10	I have seen the task which God has given the sons of men with which to occupy themselves.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	3	11	He has made everything appropriate in its time. He has also set eternity in their heart, yet so that man will not find out the work which God has done from the beginning even to the end.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	3	12	I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice and to do good in one's lifetime;
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	3	13	moreover, that every man who eats and drinks sees good in all his labor--it is the gift of God.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	3	14	I know that everything God does will remain forever; there is nothing to add to it and there is nothing to take from it, for God has so worked that men should fear Him.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	3	15	That which is has been already and that which will be has already been, for God seeks what has passed by.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	3	16	Furthermore, I have seen under the sun that in the place of justice there is wickedness and in the place of righteousness there is wickedness.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	3	17	I said to myself, "God will judge both the righteous man and the wicked man," for a time for every matter and for every deed is there.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	3	18	I said to myself concerning the sons of men, "God has surely tested them in order for them to see that they are but beasts."
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	3	19	For the fate of the sons of men and the fate of beasts is the same. As one dies so dies the other; indeed, they all have the same breath and there is no advantage for man over beast, for all is vanity.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	3	20	All go to the same place. All came from the dust and all return to the dust.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	3	21	Who knows that the breath of man ascends upward and the breath of the beast descends downward to the earth?
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	3	22	I have seen that nothing is better than that man should be happy in his activities, for that is his lot. For who will bring him to see what will occur after him?
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	4	1	Then I looked again at all the acts of oppression which were being done under the sun. And behold I saw the tears of the oppressed and that they had no one to comfort them; and on the side of their oppressors was power, but they had no one to comfort them.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	4	2	So I congratulated the dead who are already dead more than the living who are still living.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	4	3	But better off than both of them is the one who has never existed, who has never seen the evil activity that is done under the sun.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	4	4	I have seen that every labor and every skill which is done is the result of rivalry between a man and his neighbor. This too is vanity and striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	4	5	The fool folds his hands and consumes his own flesh.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	4	6	One hand full of rest is better than two fists full of labor and striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	4	7	Then I looked again at vanity under the sun.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	4	8	There was a certain man without a dependent, having neither a son nor a brother, yet there was no end to all his labor. Indeed, his eyes were not satisfied with riches and he never asked, "And for whom am I laboring and depriving myself of pleasure?" This too is vanity and it is a grievous task.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	4	9	Two are better than one because they have a good return for their labor.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	4	10	For if either of them falls, the one will lift up his companion. But woe to the one who falls when there is not another to lift him up.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	4	11	Furthermore, if two lie down together they keep warm, but how can one be warm alone?
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	4	12	And if one can overpower him who is alone, two can resist him. A cord of three strands is not quickly torn apart.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	4	13	A poor yet wise lad is better than an old and foolish king who no longer knows how to receive instruction.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	4	14	For he has come out of prison to become king, even though he was born poor in his kingdom.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	4	15	I have seen all the living under the sun throng to the side of the second lad who replaces him.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	4	16	There is no end to all the people, to all who were before them, and even the ones who will come later will not be happy with him, for this too is vanity and striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	5	1	Guard your steps as you go to the house of God and draw near to listen rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools; for they do not know they are doing evil.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	5	2	Do not be hasty in word or impulsive in thought to bring up a matter in the presence of God. For God is in heaven and you are on the earth; therefore let your words be few.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	5	3	For the dream comes through much effort and the voice of a fool through many words.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	5	4	When you make a vow to God, do not be late in paying it; for He takes no delight in fools. Pay what you vow!
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	5	5	It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	5	6	Do not let your speech cause you to sin and do not say in the presence of the messenger of God that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry on account of your voice and destroy the work of your hands?
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	5	7	For in many dreams and in many words there is emptiness. Rather, fear God.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	5	8	If you see oppression of the poor and denial of justice and righteousness in the province, do not be shocked at the sight; for one official watches over another official, and there are higher officials over them.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	5	9	After all, a king who cultivates the field is an advantage to the land.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	5	10	He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves abundance with its income. This too is vanity.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	5	11	When good things increase, those who consume them increase. So what is the advantage to their owners except to look on?
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	5	12	The sleep of the working man is pleasant, whether he eats little or much; but the full stomach of the rich man does not allow him to sleep.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	5	13	There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun: riches being hoarded by their owner to his hurt.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	5	14	When those riches were lost through a bad investment and he had fathered a son, then there was nothing to support him.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	5	15	As he had come naked from his mother's womb, so will he return as he came. He will take nothing from the fruit of his labor that he can carry in his hand.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	5	16	This also is a grievous evil--exactly as a man is born, thus will he die. So what is the advantage to him who toils for the wind?
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	5	17	Throughout his life he also eats in darkness with great vexation, sickness and anger.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	5	18	Here is what I have seen to be good and fitting: to eat, to drink and enjoy oneself in all one's labor in which he toils under the sun during the few years of his life which God has given him; for this is his reward.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	5	19	Furthermore, as for every man to whom God has given riches and wealth, He has also empowered him to eat from them and to receive his reward and rejoice in his labor; this is the gift of God.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	5	20	For he will not often consider the years of his life, because God keeps him occupied with the gladness of his heart.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	6	1	There is an evil which I have seen under the sun and it is prevalent among men--
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	6	2	a man to whom God has given riches and wealth and honor so that his soul lacks nothing of all that he desires; yet God has not empowered him to eat from them, for a foreigner enjoys them. This is vanity and a severe affliction.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	6	3	If a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years, however many they be, but his soul is not satisfied with good things and he does not even have a proper burial, then I say, "Better the miscarriage than he,
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	6	4	for it comes in futility and goes into obscurity; and its name is covered in obscurity.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	6	5	"It never sees the sun and it never knows anything; it is better off than he.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	6	6	"Even if the other man lives a thousand years twice and does not enjoy good things--do not all go to one place?"
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	6	7	All a man's labor is for his mouth and yet the appetite is not satisfied.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	6	8	For what advantage does the wise man have over the fool? What advantage does the poor man have, knowing how to walk before the living?
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	6	9	What the eyes see is better than what the soul desires. This too is futility and a striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	6	10	Whatever exists has already been named, and it is known what man is; for he cannot dispute with him who is stronger than he is.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	6	11	For there are many words which increase futility. What then is the advantage to a man?
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	6	12	For who knows what is good for a man during his lifetime, during the few years of his futile life? He will spend them like a shadow. For who can tell a man what will be after him under the sun?
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	7	1	A good name is better than a good ointment, And the day of one's death is better than the day of one's birth.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	7	2	It is better to go to a house of mourning Than to go to a house of feasting, Because that is the end of every man, And the living takes it to heart.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	7	3	Sorrow is better than laughter, For when a face is sad a heart may be happy.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	7	4	The mind of the wise is in the house of mourning, While the mind of fools is in the house of pleasure.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	7	5	It is better to listen to the rebuke of a wise man Than for one to listen to the song of fools.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	7	6	For as the crackling of thorn bushes under a pot, So is the laughter of the fool; And this too is futility.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	7	7	For oppression makes a wise man mad, And a bribe corrupts the heart.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	7	8	The end of a matter is better than its beginning; Patience of spirit is better than haughtiness of spirit.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	7	9	Do not be eager in your heart to be angry, For anger resides in the bosom of fools.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	7	10	Do not say, "Why is it that the former days were better than these?" For it is not from wisdom that you ask about this.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	7	11	Wisdom along with an inheritance is good And an advantage to those who see the sun.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	7	12	For wisdom is protection just as money is protection, But the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the lives of its possessors.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	7	13	Consider the work of God, For who is able to straighten what He has bent?
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	7	14	In the day of prosperity be happy, But in the day of adversity consider-- God has made the one as well as the other So that man will not discover anything that will be after him.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	7	15	I have seen everything during my lifetime of futility; there is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness and there is a wicked man who prolongs his life in his wickedness.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	7	16	Do not be excessively righteous and do not be overly wise. Why should you ruin yourself?
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	7	17	Do not be excessively wicked and do not be a fool. Why should you die before your time?
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	7	18	It is good that you grasp one thing and also not let go of the other; for the one who fears God comes forth with both of them.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	7	19	Wisdom strengthens a wise man more than ten rulers who are in a city.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	7	20	Indeed, there is not a righteous man on earth who continually does good and who never sins.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	7	21	Also, do not take seriously all words which are spoken, so that you will not hear your servant cursing you.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	7	22	For you also have realized that you likewise have many times cursed others.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	7	23	I tested all this with wisdom, and I said, "I will be wise," but it was far from me.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	7	24	What has been is remote and exceedingly mysterious. Who can discover it?
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	7	25	I directed my mind to know, to investigate and to seek wisdom and an explanation, and to know the evil of folly and the foolishness of madness.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	7	26	And I discovered more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets, whose hands are chains. One who is pleasing to God will escape from her, but the sinner will be captured by her.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	7	27	"Behold, I have discovered this," says the Preacher, "adding one thing to another to find an explanation,
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	7	28	which I am still seeking but have not found. I have found one man among a thousand, but I have not found a woman among all these.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	7	29	"Behold, I have found only this, that God made men upright, but they have sought out many devices."
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	8	1	Who is like the wise man and who knows the interpretation of a matter? A man's wisdom illumines him and causes his stern face to beam.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	8	2	I say, "Keep the command of the king because of the oath before God.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	8	3	"Do not be in a hurry to leave him. Do not join in an evil matter, for he will do whatever he pleases."
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	8	4	Since the word of the king is authoritative, who will say to him, "What are you doing?"
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	8	5	He who keeps a royal command experiences no trouble, for a wise heart knows the proper time and procedure.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	8	6	For there is a proper time and procedure for every delight, though a man's trouble is heavy upon him.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	8	7	If no one knows what will happen, who can tell him when it will happen?
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	8	8	No man has authority to restrain the wind with the wind, or authority over the day of death; and there is no discharge in the time of war, and evil will not deliver those who practice it.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	8	9	All this I have seen and applied my mind to every deed that has been done under the sun wherein a man has exercised authority over another man to his hurt.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	8	10	So then, I have seen the wicked buried, those who used to go in and out from the holy place, and they are soon forgotten in the city where they did thus. This too is futility.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	8	11	Because the sentence against an evil deed is not executed quickly, therefore the hearts of the sons of men among them are given fully to do evil.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	8	12	Although a sinner does evil a hundred times and may lengthen his life, still I know that it will be well for those who fear God, who fear Him openly.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	8	13	But it will not be well for the evil man and he will not lengthen his days like a shadow, because he does not fear God.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	8	14	There is futility which is done on the earth, that is, there are righteous men to whom it happens according to the deeds of the wicked. On the other hand, there are evil men to whom it happens according to the deeds of the righteous. I say that this too is futility.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	8	15	So I commended pleasure, for there is nothing good for a man under the sun except to eat and to drink and to be merry, and this will stand by him in his toils throughout the days of his life which God has given him under the sun.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	8	16	When I gave my heart to know wisdom and to see the task which has been done on the earth (even though one should never sleep day or night),
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	8	17	and I saw every work of God, I concluded that man cannot discover the work which has been done under the sun. Even though man should seek laboriously, he will not discover; and though the wise man should say, "I know," he cannot discover.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	9	1	For I have taken all this to my heart and explain it that righteous men, wise men, and their deeds are in the hand of God. Man does not know whether it will be love or hatred; anything awaits him.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	9	2	It is the same for all. There is one fate for the righteous and for the wicked; for the good, for the clean and for the unclean; for the man who offers a sacrifice and for the one who does not sacrifice. As the good man is, so is the sinner; as the swearer is, so is the one who is afraid to swear.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	9	3	This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that there is one fate for all men. Furthermore, the hearts of the sons of men are full of evil and insanity is in their hearts throughout their lives. Afterwards they go to the dead.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	9	4	For whoever is joined with all the living, there is hope; surely a live dog is better than a dead lion.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	9	5	For the living know they will die; but the dead do not know anything, nor have they any longer a reward, for their memory is forgotten.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	9	6	Indeed their love, their hate and their zeal have already perished, and they will no longer have a share in all that is done under the sun.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	9	7	Go then, eat your bread in happiness and drink your wine with a cheerful heart; for God has already approved your works.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	9	8	Let your clothes be white all the time, and let not oil be lacking on your head.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	9	9	Enjoy life with the woman whom you love all the days of your fleeting life which He has given to you under the sun; for this is your reward in life and in your toil in which you have labored under the sun.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	9	10	Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might; for there is no activity or planning or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol where you are going.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	9	11	I again saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift and the battle is not to the warriors, and neither is bread to the wise nor wealth to the discerning nor favor to men of ability; for time and chance overtake them all.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	9	12	Moreover, man does not know his time: like fish caught in a treacherous net and birds trapped in a snare, so the sons of men are ensnared at an evil time when it suddenly falls on them.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	9	13	Also this I came to see as wisdom under the sun, and it impressed me.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	9	14	There was a small city with few men in it and a great king came to it, surrounded it and constructed large siegeworks against it.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	9	15	But there was found in it a poor wise man and he delivered the city by his wisdom. Yet no one remembered that poor man.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	9	16	So I said, "Wisdom is better than strength." But the wisdom of the poor man is despised and his words are not heeded.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	9	17	The words of the wise heard in quietness are better than the shouting of a ruler among fools.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	9	18	Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	10	1	Dead flies make a perfumer's oil stink, so a little foolishness is weightier than wisdom and honor.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	10	2	A wise man's heart directs him toward the right, but the foolish man's heart directs him toward the left.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	10	3	Even when the fool walks along the road, his sense is lacking and he demonstrates to everyone that he is a fool.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	10	4	If the ruler's temper rises against you, do not abandon your position, because composure allays great offenses.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	10	5	There is an evil I have seen under the sun, like an error which goes forth from the ruler--
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	10	6	folly is set in many exalted places while rich men sit in humble places.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	10	7	I have seen slaves riding on horses and princes walking like slaves on the land.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	10	8	He who digs a pit may fall into it, and a serpent may bite him who breaks through a wall.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	10	9	He who quarries stones may be hurt by them, and he who splits logs may be endangered by them.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	10	10	If the axe is dull and he does not sharpen its edge, then he must exert more strength. Wisdom has the advantage of giving success.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	10	11	If the serpent bites before being charmed, there is no profit for the charmer.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	10	12	Words from the mouth of a wise man are gracious, while the lips of a fool consume him;
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	10	13	the beginning of his talking is folly and the end of it is wicked madness.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	10	14	Yet the fool multiplies words. No man knows what will happen, and who can tell him what will come after him?
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	10	15	The toil of a fool so wearies him that he does not even know how to go to a city.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	10	16	Woe to you, O land, whose king is a lad and whose princes feast in the morning.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	10	17	Blessed are you, O land, whose king is of nobility and whose princes eat at the appropriate time--for strength and not for drunkenness.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	10	18	Through indolence the rafters sag, and through slackness the house leaks.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	10	19	Men prepare a meal for enjoyment, and wine makes life merry, and money is the answer to everything.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	10	20	Furthermore, in your bedchamber do not curse a king, and in your sleeping rooms do not curse a rich man, for a bird of the heavens will carry the sound and the winged creature will make the matter known.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	11	1	Cast your bread on the surface of the waters, for you will find it after many days.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	11	2	Divide your portion to seven, or even to eight, for you do not know what misfortune may occur on the earth.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	11	3	If the clouds are full, they pour out rain upon the earth; and whether a tree falls toward the south or toward the north, wherever the tree falls, there it lies.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	11	4	He who watches the wind will not sow and he who looks at the clouds will not reap.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	11	5	Just as you do not know the path of the wind and how bones are formed in the womb of the pregnant woman, so you do not know the activity of God who makes all things.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	11	6	Sow your seed in the morning and do not be idle in the evening, for you do not know whether morning or evening sowing will succeed, or whether both of them alike will be good.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	11	7	The light is pleasant, and it is good for the eyes to see the sun.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	11	8	Indeed, if a man should live many years, let him rejoice in them all, and let him remember the days of darkness, for they will be many. Everything that is to come will be futility.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	11	9	Rejoice, young man, during your childhood, and let your heart be pleasant during the days of young manhood. And follow the impulses of your heart and the desires of your eyes. Yet know that God will bring you to judgment for all these things.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	11	10	So, remove grief and anger from your heart and put away pain from your body, because childhood and the prime of life are fleeting.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	12	1	Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth, before the evil days come and the years draw near when you will say, "I have no delight in them";
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	12	2	before the sun and the light, the moon and the stars are darkened, and clouds return after the rain;
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	12	3	in the day that the watchmen of the house tremble, and mighty men stoop, the grinding ones stand idle because they are few, and those who look through windows grow dim;
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	12	4	and the doors on the street are shut as the sound of the grinding mill is low, and one will arise at the sound of the bird, and all the daughters of song will sing softly.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	12	5	Furthermore, men are afraid of a high place and of terrors on the road; the almond tree blossoms, the grasshopper drags himself along, and the caperberry is ineffective. For man goes to his eternal home while mourners go about in the street.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	12	6	Remember Him before the silver cord is broken and the golden bowl is crushed, the pitcher by the well is shattered and the wheel at the cistern is crushed;
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	12	7	then the dust will return to the earth as it was, and the spirit will return to God who gave it.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	12	8	"Vanity of vanities," says the Preacher, "all is vanity!"
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	12	9	In addition to being a wise man, the Preacher also taught the people knowledge; and he pondered, searched out and arranged many proverbs.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	12	10	The Preacher sought to find delightful words and to write words of truth correctly.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	12	11	The words of wise men are like goads, and masters of these collections are like well-driven nails; they are given by one Shepherd.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	12	12	But beyond this, my son, be warned: the writing of many books is endless, and excessive devotion to books is wearying to the body.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	12	13	The conclusion, when all has been heard, is: fear God and keep His commandments, because this applies to every person.
Ecclesiastes	Eccl	21	12	14	For God will bring every act to judgment, everything which is hidden, whether it is good or evil.

Isaiah	Isa	23	1	1	The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz concerning Judah and Jerusalem, which he saw during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
Isaiah	Isa	23	1	2	Listen, O heavens, and hear, O earth; For the LORD speaks, "Sons I have reared and brought up, But they have revolted against Me.
Isaiah	Isa	23	1	3	"An ox knows its owner, And a donkey its master's manger, But Israel does not know, My people do not understand."
Isaiah	Isa	23	1	4	Alas, sinful nation, People weighed down with iniquity, Offspring of evildoers, Sons who act corruptly! They have abandoned the LORD, They have despised the Holy One of Israel, They have turned away from Him.
Isaiah	Isa	23	1	5	Where will you be stricken again, As you continue in your rebellion? The whole head is sick And the whole heart is faint.
Isaiah	Isa	23	1	6	From the sole of the foot even to the head There is nothing sound in it, Only bruises, welts and raw wounds, Not pressed out or bandaged, Nor softened with oil.
Isaiah	Isa	23	1	7	Your land is desolate, Your cities are burned with fire, Your fields--strangers are devouring them in your presence; It is desolation, as overthrown by strangers.
Isaiah	Isa	23	1	8	The daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, Like a watchman's hut in a cucumber field, like a besieged city.
Isaiah	Isa	23	1	9	Unless the LORD of hosts Had left us a few survivors, We would be like Sodom, We would be like Gomorrah.
Isaiah	Isa	23	1	10	Hear the word of the LORD, You rulers of Sodom; Give ear to the instruction of our God, You people of Gomorrah.
Isaiah	Isa	23	1	11	"What are your multiplied sacrifices to Me?" Says the LORD. "I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams And the fat of fed cattle; And I take no pleasure in the blood of bulls, lambs or goats.
Isaiah	Isa	23	1	12	"When you come to appear before Me, Who requires of you this trampling of My courts?
Isaiah	Isa	23	1	13	"Bring your worthless offerings no longer, Incense is an abomination to Me. New moon and sabbath, the calling of assemblies-- I cannot endure iniquity and the solemn assembly.
Isaiah	Isa	23	1	14	"I hate your new moon festivals and your appointed feasts, They have become a burden to Me; I am weary of bearing them.
Isaiah	Isa	23	1	15	"So when you spread out your hands in prayer, I will hide My eyes from you; Yes, even though you multiply prayers, I will not listen. Your hands are covered with blood.
Isaiah	Isa	23	1	16	"Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean; Remove the evil of your deeds from My sight. Cease to do evil,
Isaiah	Isa	23	1	17	Learn to do good; Seek justice, Reprove the ruthless, Defend the orphan, Plead for the widow.
Isaiah	Isa	23	1	18	"Come now, and let us reason together," Says the LORD, "Though your sins are as scarlet, They will be as white as snow; Though they are red like crimson, They will be like wool.
Isaiah	Isa	23	1	19	"If you consent and obey, You will eat the best of the land;
Isaiah	Isa	23	1	20	"But if you refuse and rebel, You will be devoured by the sword." Truly, the mouth of the LORD has spoken.
Isaiah	Isa	23	1	21	How the faithful city has become a harlot, She who was full of justice! Righteousness once lodged in her, But now murderers.
Isaiah	Isa	23	1	22	Your silver has become dross, Your drink diluted with water.
Isaiah	Isa	23	1	23	Your rulers are rebels And companions of thieves; Everyone loves a bribe And chases after rewards. They do not defend the orphan, Nor does the widow's plea come before them.
Isaiah	Isa	23	1	24	Therefore the Lord GOD of hosts, The Mighty One of Israel, declares, "Ah, I will be relieved of My adversaries And avenge Myself on My foes.
Isaiah	Isa	23	1	25	"I will also turn My hand against you, And will smelt away your dross as with lye And will remove all your alloy.
Isaiah	Isa	23	1	26	"Then I will restore your judges as at the first, And your counselors as at the beginning; After that you will be called the city of righteousness, A faithful city."
Isaiah	Isa	23	1	27	Zion will be redeemed with justice And her repentant ones with righteousness.
Isaiah	Isa	23	1	28	But transgressors and sinners will be crushed together, And those who forsake the LORD will come to an end.
Isaiah	Isa	23	1	29	Surely you will be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired, And you will be embarrassed at the gardens which you have chosen.
Isaiah	Isa	23	1	30	For you will be like an oak whose leaf fades away Or as a garden that has no water.
Isaiah	Isa	23	1	31	The strong man will become tinder, His work also a spark. Thus they shall both burn together And there will be none to quench them.
Isaiah	Isa	23	2	1	The word which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
Isaiah	Isa	23	2	2	Now it will come about that In the last days The mountain of the house of the LORD Will be established as the chief of the mountains, And will be raised above the hills; And all the nations will stream to it.
Isaiah	Isa	23	2	3	And many peoples will come and say, "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, To the house of the God of Jacob; That He may teach us concerning His ways And that we may walk in His paths." For the law will go forth from Zion And the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
Isaiah	Isa	23	2	4	And He will judge between the nations, And will render decisions for many peoples; And they will hammer their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not lift up sword against nation, And never again will they learn war.
Isaiah	Isa	23	2	5	Come, house of Jacob, and let us walk in the light of the LORD.
Isaiah	Isa	23	2	6	For You have abandoned Your people, the house of Jacob, Because they are filled with influences from the east, And they are soothsayers like the Philistines, And they strike bargains with the children of foreigners.
Isaiah	Isa	23	2	7	Their land has also been filled with silver and gold And there is no end to their treasures; Their land has also been filled with horses And there is no end to their chariots.
Isaiah	Isa	23	2	8	Their land has also been filled with idols; They worship the work of their hands, That which their fingers have made.
Isaiah	Isa	23	2	9	So the common man has been humbled And the man of importance has been abased, But do not forgive them.
Isaiah	Isa	23	2	10	Enter the rock and hide in the dust From the terror of the LORD and from the splendor of His majesty.
Isaiah	Isa	23	2	11	The proud look of man will be abased And the loftiness of man will be humbled, And the LORD alone will be exalted in that day.
Isaiah	Isa	23	2	12	For the LORD of hosts will have a day of reckoning Against everyone who is proud and lofty And against everyone who is lifted up, That he may be abased.
Isaiah	Isa	23	2	13	And it will be against all the cedars of Lebanon that are lofty and lifted up, Against all the oaks of Bashan,
Isaiah	Isa	23	2	14	Against all the lofty mountains, Against all the hills that are lifted up,
Isaiah	Isa	23	2	15	Against every high tower, Against every fortified wall,
Isaiah	Isa	23	2	16	Against all the ships of Tarshish And against all the beautiful craft.
Isaiah	Isa	23	2	17	The pride of man will be humbled And the loftiness of men will be abased; And the LORD alone will be exalted in that day,
Isaiah	Isa	23	2	18	But the idols will completely vanish.
Isaiah	Isa	23	2	19	Men will go into caves of the rocks And into holes of the ground Before the terror of the LORD And the splendor of His majesty, When He arises to make the earth tremble.
Isaiah	Isa	23	2	20	In that day men will cast away to the moles and the bats Their idols of silver and their idols of gold, Which they made for themselves to worship,
Isaiah	Isa	23	2	21	In order to go into the caverns of the rocks and the clefts of the cliffs Before the terror of the LORD and the splendor of His majesty, When He arises to make the earth tremble.
Isaiah	Isa	23	2	22	Stop regarding man, whose breath of life is in his nostrils; For why should he be esteemed?
Isaiah	Isa	23	3	1	For behold, the Lord GOD of hosts is going to remove from Jerusalem and Judah Both supply and support, the whole supply of bread And the whole supply of water;
Isaiah	Isa	23	3	2	The mighty man and the warrior, The judge and the prophet, The diviner and the elder,
Isaiah	Isa	23	3	3	The captain of fifty and the honorable man, The counselor and the expert artisan, And the skillful enchanter.
Isaiah	Isa	23	3	4	And I will make mere lads their princes, And capricious children will rule over them,
Isaiah	Isa	23	3	5	And the people will be oppressed, Each one by another, and each one by his neighbor; The youth will storm against the elder And the inferior against the honorable.
Isaiah	Isa	23	3	6	When a man lays hold of his brother in his father's house, saying, "You have a cloak, you shall be our ruler, And these ruins will be under your charge,"
Isaiah	Isa	23	3	7	He will protest on that day, saying, "I will not be your healer, For in my house there is neither bread nor cloak; You should not appoint me ruler of the people."
Isaiah	Isa	23	3	8	For Jerusalem has stumbled and Judah has fallen, Because their speech and their actions are against the LORD, To rebel against His glorious presence.
Isaiah	Isa	23	3	9	The expression of their faces bears witness against them, And they display their sin like Sodom; They do not even conceal it. Woe to them! For they have brought evil on themselves.
Isaiah	Isa	23	3	10	Say to the righteous that it will go well with them, For they will eat the fruit of their actions.
Isaiah	Isa	23	3	11	Woe to the wicked! It will go badly with him, For what he deserves will be done to him.
Isaiah	Isa	23	3	12	O My people! Their oppressors are children, And women rule over them. O My people! Those who guide you lead you astray And confuse the direction of your paths.
Isaiah	Isa	23	3	13	The LORD arises to contend, And stands to judge the people.
Isaiah	Isa	23	3	14	The LORD enters into judgment with the elders and princes of His people, "It is you who have devoured the vineyard; The plunder of the poor is in your houses.
Isaiah	Isa	23	3	15	"What do you mean by crushing My people And grinding the face of the poor?" Declares the Lord GOD of hosts.
Isaiah	Isa	23	3	16	Moreover, the LORD said, "Because the daughters of Zion are proud And walk with heads held high and seductive eyes, And go along with mincing steps And tinkle the bangles on their feet,
Isaiah	Isa	23	3	17	Therefore the Lord will afflict the scalp of the daughters of Zion with scabs, And the LORD will make their foreheads bare."
Isaiah	Isa	23	3	18	In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets, headbands, crescent ornaments,
Isaiah	Isa	23	3	19	dangling earrings, bracelets, veils,
Isaiah	Isa	23	3	20	headdresses, ankle chains, sashes, perfume boxes, amulets,
Isaiah	Isa	23	3	21	finger rings, nose rings,
Isaiah	Isa	23	3	22	festal robes, outer tunics, cloaks, money purses,
Isaiah	Isa	23	3	23	hand mirrors, undergarments, turbans and veils.
Isaiah	Isa	23	3	24	Now it will come about that instead of sweet perfume there will be putrefaction; Instead of a belt, a rope; Instead of well-set hair, a plucked-out scalp; Instead of fine clothes, a donning of sackcloth; And branding instead of beauty.
Isaiah	Isa	23	3	25	Your men will fall by the sword And your mighty ones in battle.
Isaiah	Isa	23	3	26	And her gates will lament and mourn, And deserted she will sit on the ground.
Isaiah	Isa	23	4	1	For seven women will take hold of one man in that day, saying, "We will eat our own bread and wear our own clothes, only let us be called by your name; take away our reproach!"
Isaiah	Isa	23	4	2	In that day the Branch of the LORD will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth will be the pride and the adornment of the survivors of Israel.
Isaiah	Isa	23	4	3	It will come about that he who is left in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called holy--everyone who is recorded for life in Jerusalem.
Isaiah	Isa	23	4	4	When the Lord has washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and purged the bloodshed of Jerusalem from her midst, by the spirit of judgment and the spirit of burning,
Isaiah	Isa	23	4	5	then the LORD will create over the whole area of Mount Zion and over her assemblies a cloud by day, even smoke, and the brightness of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory will be a canopy.
Isaiah	Isa	23	4	6	There will be a shelter to give shade from the heat by day, and refuge and protection from the storm and the rain.
Isaiah	Isa	23	5	1	Let me sing now for my well-beloved A song of my beloved concerning His vineyard. My well-beloved had a vineyard on a fertile hill.
Isaiah	Isa	23	5	2	He dug it all around, removed its stones, And planted it with the choicest vine. And He built a tower in the middle of it And also hewed out a wine vat in it; Then He expected it to produce good grapes, But it produced only worthless ones.
Isaiah	Isa	23	5	3	"And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, Judge between Me and My vineyard.
Isaiah	Isa	23	5	4	"What more was there to do for My vineyard that I have not done in it? Why, when I expected it to produce good grapes did it produce worthless ones?
Isaiah	Isa	23	5	5	"So now let Me tell you what I am going to do to My vineyard: I will remove its hedge and it will be consumed; I will break down its wall and it will become trampled ground.
Isaiah	Isa	23	5	6	"I will lay it waste; It will not be pruned or hoed, But briars and thorns will come up. I will also charge the clouds to rain no rain on it."
Isaiah	Isa	23	5	7	For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel And the men of Judah His delightful plant. Thus He looked for justice, but behold, bloodshed; For righteousness, but behold, a cry of distress.
Isaiah	Isa	23	5	8	Woe to those who add house to house and join field to field, Until there is no more room, So that you have to live alone in the midst of the land!
Isaiah	Isa	23	5	9	In my ears the LORD of hosts has sworn, "Surely, many houses shall become desolate, Even great and fine ones, without occupants.
Isaiah	Isa	23	5	10	"For ten acres of vineyard will yield only one bath of wine, And a homer of seed will yield but an ephah of grain."
Isaiah	Isa	23	5	11	Woe to those who rise early in the morning that they may pursue strong drink, Who stay up late in the evening that wine may inflame them!
Isaiah	Isa	23	5	12	Their banquets are accompanied by lyre and harp, by tambourine and flute, and by wine; But they do not pay attention to the deeds of the LORD, Nor do they consider the work of His hands.
Isaiah	Isa	23	5	13	Therefore My people go into exile for their lack of knowledge; And their honorable men are famished, And their multitude is parched with thirst.
Isaiah	Isa	23	5	14	Therefore Sheol has enlarged its throat and opened its mouth without measure; And Jerusalem's splendor, her multitude, her din of revelry and the jubilant within her, descend into it.
Isaiah	Isa	23	5	15	So the common man will be humbled and the man of importance abased, The eyes of the proud also will be abased.
Isaiah	Isa	23	5	16	But the LORD of hosts will be exalted in judgment, And the holy God will show Himself holy in righteousness.
Isaiah	Isa	23	5	17	Then the lambs will graze as in their pasture, And strangers will eat in the waste places of the wealthy.
Isaiah	Isa	23	5	18	Woe to those who drag iniquity with the cords of falsehood, And sin as if with cart ropes;
Isaiah	Isa	23	5	19	Who say, "Let Him make speed, let Him hasten His work, that we may see it; And let the purpose of the Holy One of Israel draw near And come to pass, that we may know it!"
Isaiah	Isa	23	5	20	Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil; Who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness; Who substitute bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!
Isaiah	Isa	23	5	21	Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes And clever in their own sight!
Isaiah	Isa	23	5	22	Woe to those who are heroes in drinking wine And valiant men in mixing strong drink,
Isaiah	Isa	23	5	23	Who justify the wicked for a bribe, And take away the rights of the ones who are in the right!
Isaiah	Isa	23	5	24	Therefore, as a tongue of fire consumes stubble And dry grass collapses into the flame, So their root will become like rot and their blossom blow away as dust; For they have rejected the law of the LORD of hosts And despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
Isaiah	Isa	23	5	25	On this account the anger of the LORD has burned against His people, And He has stretched out His hand against them and struck them down. And the mountains quaked, and their corpses lay like refuse in the middle of the streets. For all this His anger is not spent, But His hand is still stretched out.
Isaiah	Isa	23	5	26	He will also lift up a standard to the distant nation, And will whistle for it from the ends of the earth; And behold, it will come with speed swiftly.
Isaiah	Isa	23	5	27	No one in it is weary or stumbles, None slumbers or sleeps; Nor is the belt at its waist undone, Nor its sandal strap broken.
Isaiah	Isa	23	5	28	Its arrows are sharp and all its bows are bent; The hoofs of its horses seem like flint and its chariot wheels like a whirlwind.
Isaiah	Isa	23	5	29	Its roaring is like a lioness, and it roars like young lions; It growls as it seizes the prey And carries it off with no one to deliver it.
Isaiah	Isa	23	5	30	And it will growl over it in that day like the roaring of the sea. If one looks to the land, behold, there is darkness and distress; Even the light is darkened by its clouds.
Isaiah	Isa	23	6	1	In the year of King Uzziah's death I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, lofty and exalted, with the train of His robe filling the temple.
Isaiah	Isa	23	6	2	Seraphim stood above Him, each having six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.
Isaiah	Isa	23	6	3	And one called out to another and said, "Holy, Holy, Holy, is the LORD of hosts, The whole earth is full of His glory."
Isaiah	Isa	23	6	4	And the foundations of the thresholds trembled at the voice of him who called out, while the temple was filling with smoke.
Isaiah	Isa	23	6	5	Then I said, "Woe is me, for I am ruined! Because I am a man of unclean lips, And I live among a people of unclean lips; For my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts."
Isaiah	Isa	23	6	6	Then one of the seraphim flew to me with a burning coal in his hand, which he had taken from the altar with tongs.
Isaiah	Isa	23	6	7	He touched my mouth with it and said, "Behold, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away and your sin is forgiven."
Isaiah	Isa	23	6	8	Then I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, "Whom shall I send, and who will go for Us?" Then I said, "Here am I. Send me!"
Isaiah	Isa	23	6	9	He said, "Go, and tell this people: 'Keep on listening, but do not perceive; Keep on looking, but do not understand.'
Isaiah	Isa	23	6	10	"Render the hearts of this people insensitive, Their ears dull, And their eyes dim, Otherwise they might see with their eyes, Hear with their ears, Understand with their hearts, And return and be healed."
Isaiah	Isa	23	6	11	Then I said, "Lord, how long?" And He answered, "Until cities are devastated and without inhabitant, Houses are without people And the land is utterly desolate,
Isaiah	Isa	23	6	12	"The LORD has removed men far away, And the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land.
Isaiah	Isa	23	6	13	"Yet there will be a tenth portion in it, And it will again be subject to burning, Like a terebinth or an oak Whose stump remains when it is felled. The holy seed is its stump."
Isaiah	Isa	23	7	1	Now it came about in the days of Ahaz, the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Aram and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to wage war against it, but could not conquer it.
Isaiah	Isa	23	7	2	When it was reported to the house of David, saying, "The Arameans have camped in Ephraim," his heart and the hearts of his people shook as the trees of the forest shake with the wind.
Isaiah	Isa	23	7	3	Then the LORD said to Isaiah, "Go out now to meet Ahaz, you and your son Shear-jashub, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, on the highway to the fuller's field,
Isaiah	Isa	23	7	4	and say to him, 'Take care and be calm, have no fear and do not be fainthearted because of these two stubs of smoldering firebrands, on account of the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram and the son of Remaliah.
Isaiah	Isa	23	7	5	'Because Aram, with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, has planned evil against you, saying,
Isaiah	Isa	23	7	6	"Let us go up against Judah and terrorize it, and make for ourselves a breach in its walls and set up the son of Tabeel as king in the midst of it,"
Isaiah	Isa	23	7	7	thus says the Lord GOD: "It shall not stand nor shall it come to pass.
Isaiah	Isa	23	7	8	"For the head of Aram is Damascus and the head of Damascus is Rezin (now within another years Ephraim will be shattered, so that it is no longer a people),
Isaiah	Isa	23	7	9	and the head of Ephraim is Samaria and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah. If you will not believe, you surely shall not last."'"
Isaiah	Isa	23	7	10	Then the LORD spoke again to Ahaz, saying,
Isaiah	Isa	23	7	11	"Ask a sign for yourself from the LORD your God; make it deep as Sheol or high as heaven."
Isaiah	Isa	23	7	12	But Ahaz said, "I will not ask, nor will I test the LORD!"
Isaiah	Isa	23	7	13	Then he said, "Listen now, O house of David! Is it too slight a thing for you to try the patience of men, that you will try the patience of my God as well?
Isaiah	Isa	23	7	14	"Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, a virgin will be with child and bear a son, and she will call His name Immanuel.
Isaiah	Isa	23	7	15	"He will eat curds and honey at the time He knows enough to refuse evil and choose good.
Isaiah	Isa	23	7	16	"For before the boy will know enough to refuse evil and choose good, the land whose two kings you dread will be forsaken.
Isaiah	Isa	23	7	17	"The LORD will bring on you, on your people, and on your father's house such days as have never come since the day that Ephraim separated from Judah, the king of Assyria."
Isaiah	Isa	23	7	18	In that day the LORD will whistle for the fly that is in the remotest part of the rivers of Egypt and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.
Isaiah	Isa	23	7	19	They will all come and settle on the steep ravines, on the ledges of the cliffs, on all the thorn bushes and on all the watering places.
Isaiah	Isa	23	7	20	In that day the Lord will shave with a razor, hired from regions beyond the Euphrates (that is, with the king of Assyria), the head and the hair of the legs; and it will also remove the beard.
Isaiah	Isa	23	7	21	Now in that day a man may keep alive a heifer and a pair of sheep;
Isaiah	Isa	23	7	22	and because of the abundance of the milk produced he will eat curds, for everyone that is left within the land will eat curds and honey.
Isaiah	Isa	23	7	23	And it will come about in that day, that every place where there used to be a thousand vines, valued at a thousand shekels of silver, will become briars and thorns.
Isaiah	Isa	23	7	24	People will come there with bows and arrows because all the land will be briars and thorns.
Isaiah	Isa	23	7	25	As for all the hills which used to be cultivated with the hoe, you will not go there for fear of briars and thorns; but they will become a place for pasturing oxen and for sheep to trample.
Isaiah	Isa	23	8	1	Then the LORD said to me, "Take for yourself a large tablet and write on it in ordinary letters: Swift is the booty, speedy is the prey.
Isaiah	Isa	23	8	2	"And I will take to Myself faithful witnesses for testimony, Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah."
Isaiah	Isa	23	8	3	So I approached the prophetess, and she conceived and gave birth to a son. Then the LORD said to me, "Name him Maher-shalal-hash-baz;
Isaiah	Isa	23	8	4	for before the boy knows how to cry out 'My father' or 'My mother,' the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria will be carried away before the king of Assyria."
Isaiah	Isa	23	8	5	Again the LORD spoke to me further, saying,
Isaiah	Isa	23	8	6	"Inasmuch as these people have rejected the gently flowing waters of Shiloah And rejoice in Rezin and the son of Remaliah;
Isaiah	Isa	23	8	7	"Now therefore, behold, the Lord is about to bring on them the strong and abundant waters of the Euphrates, Even the king of Assyria and all his glory; And it will rise up over all its channels and go over all its banks.
Isaiah	Isa	23	8	8	"Then it will sweep on into Judah, it will overflow and pass through, It will reach even to the neck; And the spread of its wings will fill the breadth of your land, O Immanuel.
Isaiah	Isa	23	8	9	"Be broken, O peoples, and be shattered; And give ear, all remote places of the earth. Gird yourselves, yet be shattered; Gird yourselves, yet be shattered.
Isaiah	Isa	23	8	10	"Devise a plan, but it will be thwarted; State a proposal, but it will not stand, For God is with us."
Isaiah	Isa	23	8	11	For thus the LORD spoke to me with mighty power and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people, saying,
Isaiah	Isa	23	8	12	"You are not to say, 'It is a conspiracy!' In regard to all that this people call a conspiracy, And you are not to fear what they fear or be in dread of it.
Isaiah	Isa	23	8	13	"It is the LORD of hosts whom you should regard as holy. And He shall be your fear, And He shall be your dread.
Isaiah	Isa	23	8	14	"Then He shall become a sanctuary; But to both the houses of Israel, a stone to strike and a rock to stumble over, And a snare and a trap for the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Isaiah	Isa	23	8	15	"Many will stumble over them, Then they will fall and be broken; They will even be snared and caught."
Isaiah	Isa	23	8	16	Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.
Isaiah	Isa	23	8	17	And I will wait for the LORD who is hiding His face from the house of Jacob; I will even look eagerly for Him.
Isaiah	Isa	23	8	18	Behold, I and the children whom the LORD has given me are for signs and wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, who dwells on Mount Zion.
Isaiah	Isa	23	8	19	When they say to you, "Consult the mediums and the spiritists who whisper and mutter," should not a people consult their God? Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living?
Isaiah	Isa	23	8	20	To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, it is because they have no dawn.
Isaiah	Isa	23	8	21	They will pass through the land hard-pressed and famished, and it will turn out that when they are hungry, they will be enraged and curse their king and their God as they face upward.
Isaiah	Isa	23	8	22	Then they will look to the earth, and behold, distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish; and they will be driven away into darkness.
Isaiah	Isa	23	9	1	But there will be no more gloom for her who was in anguish; in earlier times He treated the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali with contempt, but later on He shall make it glorious, by the way of the sea, on the other side of Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles.
Isaiah	Isa	23	9	2	The people who walk in darkness Will see a great light; Those who live in a dark land, The light will shine on them.
Isaiah	Isa	23	9	3	You shall multiply the nation, You shall increase their gladness; They will be glad in Your presence As with the gladness of harvest, As men rejoice when they divide the spoil.
Isaiah	Isa	23	9	4	For You shall break the yoke of their burden and the staff on their shoulders, The rod of their oppressor, as at the battle of Midian.
Isaiah	Isa	23	9	5	For every boot of the booted warrior in the battle tumult, And cloak rolled in blood, will be for burning, fuel for the fire.
Isaiah	Isa	23	9	6	For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us; And the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.
Isaiah	Isa	23	9	7	There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, On the throne of David and over his kingdom, To establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness From then on and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will accomplish this.
Isaiah	Isa	23	9	8	The Lord sends a message against Jacob, And it falls on Israel.
Isaiah	Isa	23	9	9	And all the people know it, That is, Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria, Asserting in pride and in arrogance of heart:
Isaiah	Isa	23	9	10	"The bricks have fallen down, But we will rebuild with smooth stones; The sycamores have been cut down, But we will replace them with cedars."
Isaiah	Isa	23	9	11	Therefore the LORD raises against them adversaries from Rezin And spurs their enemies on,
Isaiah	Isa	23	9	12	The Arameans on the east and the Philistines on the west; And they devour Israel with gaping jaws. In spite of all this, His anger does not turn away And His hand is still stretched out.
Isaiah	Isa	23	9	13	Yet the people do not turn back to Him who struck them, Nor do they seek the LORD of hosts.
Isaiah	Isa	23	9	14	So the LORD cuts off head and tail from Israel, Both palm branch and bulrush in a single day.
Isaiah	Isa	23	9	15	The head is the elder and honorable man, And the prophet who teaches falsehood is the tail.
Isaiah	Isa	23	9	16	For those who guide this people are leading them astray; And those who are guided by them are brought to confusion.
Isaiah	Isa	23	9	17	Therefore the Lord does not take pleasure in their young men, Nor does He have pity on their orphans or their widows; For every one of them is godless and an evildoer, And every mouth is speaking foolishness. In spite of all this, His anger does not turn away And His hand is still stretched out.
Isaiah	Isa	23	9	18	For wickedness burns like a fire; It consumes briars and thorns; It even sets the thickets of the forest aflame And they roll upward in a column of smoke.
Isaiah	Isa	23	9	19	By the fury of the LORD of hosts the land is burned up, And the people are like fuel for the fire; No man spares his brother.
Isaiah	Isa	23	9	20	They slice off what is on the right hand but still are hungry, And they eat what is on the left hand but they are not satisfied; Each of them eats the flesh of his own arm.
Isaiah	Isa	23	9	21	Manasseh devours Ephraim, and Ephraim Manasseh, And together they are against Judah. In spite of all this, His anger does not turn away And His hand is still stretched out.
Isaiah	Isa	23	10	1	Woe to those who enact evil statutes And to those who constantly record unjust decisions,
Isaiah	Isa	23	10	2	So as to deprive the needy of justice And rob the poor of My people of their rights, So that widows may be their spoil And that they may plunder the orphans.
Isaiah	Isa	23	10	3	Now what will you do in the day of punishment, And in the devastation which will come from afar? To whom will you flee for help? And where will you leave your wealth?
Isaiah	Isa	23	10	4	Nothing remains but to crouch among the captives Or fall among the slain. In spite of all this, His anger does not turn away And His hand is still stretched out.
Isaiah	Isa	23	10	5	Woe to Assyria, the rod of My anger And the staff in whose hands is My indignation,
Isaiah	Isa	23	10	6	I send it against a godless nation And commission it against the people of My fury To capture booty and to seize plunder, And to trample them down like mud in the streets.
Isaiah	Isa	23	10	7	Yet it does not so intend, Nor does it plan so in its heart, But rather it is its purpose to destroy And to cut off many nations.
Isaiah	Isa	23	10	8	For it says, "Are not my princes all kings?
Isaiah	Isa	23	10	9	"Is not Calno like Carchemish, Or Hamath like Arpad, Or Samaria like Damascus?
Isaiah	Isa	23	10	10	"As my hand has reached to the kingdoms of the idols, Whose graven images were greater than those of Jerusalem and Samaria,
Isaiah	Isa	23	10	11	Shall I not do to Jerusalem and her images Just as I have done to Samaria and her idols?"
Isaiah	Isa	23	10	12	So it will be that when the Lord has completed all His work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, He will say, "I will punish the fruit of the arrogant heart of the king of Assyria and the pomp of his haughtiness."
Isaiah	Isa	23	10	13	For he has said, "By the power of my hand and by my wisdom I did this, For I have understanding; And I removed the boundaries of the peoples And plundered their treasures, And like a mighty man I brought down their inhabitants,
Isaiah	Isa	23	10	14	And my hand reached to the riches of the peoples like a nest, And as one gathers abandoned eggs, I gathered all the earth; And there was not one that flapped its wing or opened its beak or chirped."
Isaiah	Isa	23	10	15	Is the axe to boast itself over the one who chops with it? Is the saw to exalt itself over the one who wields it? That would be like a club wielding those who lift it, Or like a rod lifting him who is not wood.
Isaiah	Isa	23	10	16	Therefore the Lord, the GOD of hosts, will send a wasting disease among his stout warriors; And under his glory a fire will be kindled like a burning flame.
Isaiah	Isa	23	10	17	And the light of Israel will become a fire and his Holy One a flame, And it will burn and devour his thorns and his briars in a single day.
Isaiah	Isa	23	10	18	And He will destroy the glory of his forest and of his fruitful garden, both soul and body, And it will be as when a sick man wastes away.
Isaiah	Isa	23	10	19	And the rest of the trees of his forest will be so small in number That a child could write them down.
Isaiah	Isa	23	10	20	Now in that day the remnant of Israel, and those of the house of Jacob who have escaped, will never again rely on the one who struck them, but will truly rely on the LORD, the Holy One of Israel.
Isaiah	Isa	23	10	21	A remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.
Isaiah	Isa	23	10	22	For though your people, O Israel, may be like the sand of the sea, Only a remnant within them will return; A destruction is determined, overflowing with righteousness.
Isaiah	Isa	23	10	23	For a complete destruction, one that is decreed, the Lord GOD of hosts will execute in the midst of the whole land.
Isaiah	Isa	23	10	24	Therefore thus says the Lord GOD of hosts, "O My people who dwell in Zion, do not fear the Assyrian who strikes you with the rod and lifts up his staff against you, the way Egypt did.
Isaiah	Isa	23	10	25	"For in a very little while My indignation against you will be spent and My anger will be directed to their destruction."
Isaiah	Isa	23	10	26	The LORD of hosts will arouse a scourge against him like the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb; and His staff will be over the sea and He will lift it up the way He did in Egypt.
Isaiah	Isa	23	10	27	So it will be in that day, that his burden will be removed from your shoulders and his yoke from your neck, and the yoke will be broken because of fatness.
Isaiah	Isa	23	10	28	He has come against Aiath, He has passed through Migron; At Michmash he deposited his baggage.
Isaiah	Isa	23	10	29	They have gone through the pass, saying, "Geba will be our lodging place." Ramah is terrified, and Gibeah of Saul has fled away.
Isaiah	Isa	23	10	30	Cry aloud with your voice, O daughter of Gallim! Pay attention, Laishah and wretched Anathoth!
Isaiah	Isa	23	10	31	Madmenah has fled. The inhabitants of Gebim have sought refuge.
Isaiah	Isa	23	10	32	Yet today he will halt at Nob; He shakes his fist at the mountain of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.
Isaiah	Isa	23	10	33	Behold, the Lord, the GOD of hosts, will lop off the boughs with a terrible crash; Those also who are tall in stature will be cut down And those who are lofty will be abased.
Isaiah	Isa	23	10	34	He will cut down the thickets of the forest with an iron axe, And Lebanon will fall by the Mighty One.
Isaiah	Isa	23	11	1	Then a shoot will spring from the stem of Jesse, And a branch from his roots will bear fruit.
Isaiah	Isa	23	11	2	The Spirit of the LORD will rest on Him, The spirit of wisdom and understanding, The spirit of counsel and strength, The spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD.
Isaiah	Isa	23	11	3	And He will delight in the fear of the LORD, And He will not judge by what His eyes see, Nor make a decision by what His ears hear;
Isaiah	Isa	23	11	4	But with righteousness He will judge the poor, And decide with fairness for the afflicted of the earth; And He will strike the earth with the rod of His mouth, And with the breath of His lips He will slay the wicked.
Isaiah	Isa	23	11	5	Also righteousness will be the belt about His loins, And faithfulness the belt about His waist.
Isaiah	Isa	23	11	6	And the wolf will dwell with the lamb, And the leopard will lie down with the young goat, And the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; And a little boy will lead them.
Isaiah	Isa	23	11	7	Also the cow and the bear will graze, Their young will lie down together, And the lion will eat straw like the ox.
Isaiah	Isa	23	11	8	The nursing child will play by the hole of the cobra, And the weaned child will put his hand on the viper's den.
Isaiah	Isa	23	11	9	They will not hurt or destroy in all My holy mountain, For the earth will be full of the knowledge of the LORD As the waters cover the sea.
Isaiah	Isa	23	11	10	Then in that day The nations will resort to the root of Jesse, Who will stand as a signal for the peoples; And His resting place will be glorious.
Isaiah	Isa	23	11	11	Then it will happen on that day that the Lord Will again recover the second time with His hand The remnant of His people, who will remain, From Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Cush, Elam, Shinar, Hamath, And from the islands of the sea.
Isaiah	Isa	23	11	12	And He will lift up a standard for the nations And assemble the banished ones of Israel, And will gather the dispersed of Judah From the four corners of the earth.
Isaiah	Isa	23	11	13	Then the jealousy of Ephraim will depart, And those who harass Judah will be cut off; Ephraim will not be jealous of Judah, And Judah will not harass Ephraim.
Isaiah	Isa	23	11	14	They will swoop down on the slopes of the Philistines on the west; Together they will plunder the sons of the east; They will possess Edom and Moab, And the sons of Ammon will be subject to them.
Isaiah	Isa	23	11	15	And the LORD will utterly destroy The tongue of the Sea of Egypt; And He will wave His hand over the River With His scorching wind; And He will strike it into seven streams And make men walk over dry-shod.
Isaiah	Isa	23	11	16	And there will be a highway from Assyria For the remnant of His people who will be left, Just as there was for Israel In the day that they came up out of the land of Egypt.
Isaiah	Isa	23	12	1	Then you will say on that day, "I will give thanks to You, O LORD; For although You were angry with me, Your anger is turned away, And You comfort me.
Isaiah	Isa	23	12	2	"Behold, God is my salvation, I will trust and not be afraid; For the LORD GOD is my strength and song, And He has become my salvation."
Isaiah	Isa	23	12	3	Therefore you will joyously draw water From the springs of salvation.
Isaiah	Isa	23	12	4	And in that day you will say, "Give thanks to the LORD, call on His name. Make known His deeds among the peoples; Make them remember that His name is exalted."
Isaiah	Isa	23	12	5	Praise the LORD in song, for He has done excellent things; Let this be known throughout the earth.
Isaiah	Isa	23	12	6	Cry aloud and shout for joy, O inhabitant of Zion, For great in your midst is the Holy One of Israel.
Isaiah	Isa	23	13	1	The oracle concerning Babylon which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw.
Isaiah	Isa	23	13	2	Lift up a standard on the bare hill, Raise your voice to them, Wave the hand that they may enter the doors of the nobles.
Isaiah	Isa	23	13	3	I have commanded My consecrated ones, I have even called My mighty warriors, My proudly exulting ones, To execute My anger.
Isaiah	Isa	23	13	4	A sound of tumult on the mountains, Like that of many people! A sound of the uproar of kingdoms, Of nations gathered together! The LORD of hosts is mustering the army for battle.
Isaiah	Isa	23	13	5	They are coming from a far country, From the farthest horizons, The LORD and His instruments of indignation, To destroy the whole land.
Isaiah	Isa	23	13	6	Wail, for the day of the LORD is near! It will come as destruction from the Almighty.
Isaiah	Isa	23	13	7	Therefore all hands will fall limp, And every man's heart will melt.
Isaiah	Isa	23	13	8	They will be terrified, Pains and anguish will take hold of them; They will writhe like a woman in labor, They will look at one another in astonishment, Their faces aflame.
Isaiah	Isa	23	13	9	Behold, the day of the LORD is coming, Cruel, with fury and burning anger, To make the land a desolation; And He will exterminate its sinners from it.
Isaiah	Isa	23	13	10	For the stars of heaven and their constellations Will not flash forth their light; The sun will be dark when it rises And the moon will not shed its light.
Isaiah	Isa	23	13	11	Thus I will punish the world for its evil And the wicked for their iniquity; I will also put an end to the arrogance of the proud And abase the haughtiness of the ruthless.
Isaiah	Isa	23	13	12	I will make mortal man scarcer than pure gold And mankind than the gold of Ophir.
Isaiah	Isa	23	13	13	Therefore I will make the heavens tremble, And the earth will be shaken from its place At the fury of the LORD of hosts In the day of His burning anger.
Isaiah	Isa	23	13	14	And it will be that like a hunted gazelle, Or like sheep with none to gather them, They will each turn to his own people, And each one flee to his own land.
Isaiah	Isa	23	13	15	Anyone who is found will be thrust through, And anyone who is captured will fall by the sword.
Isaiah	Isa	23	13	16	Their little ones also will be dashed to pieces Before their eyes; Their houses will be plundered And their wives ravished.
Isaiah	Isa	23	13	17	Behold, I am going to stir up the Medes against them, Who will not value silver or take pleasure in gold.
Isaiah	Isa	23	13	18	And their bows will mow down the young men, They will not even have compassion on the fruit of the womb, Nor will their eye pity children.
Isaiah	Isa	23	13	19	And Babylon, the beauty of kingdoms, the glory of the Chaldeans' pride, Will be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.
Isaiah	Isa	23	13	20	It will never be inhabited or lived in from generation to generation; Nor will the Arab pitch his tent there, Nor will shepherds make their flocks lie down there.
Isaiah	Isa	23	13	21	But desert creatures will lie down there, And their houses will be full of owls; Ostriches also will live there, and shaggy goats will frolic there.
Isaiah	Isa	23	13	22	Hyenas will howl in their fortified towers And jackals in their luxurious palaces. Her fateful time also will soon come And her days will not be prolonged.
Isaiah	Isa	23	14	1	When the LORD will have compassion on Jacob and again choose Israel, and settle them in their own land, then strangers will join them and attach themselves to the house of Jacob.
Isaiah	Isa	23	14	2	The peoples will take them along and bring them to their place, and the house of Israel will possess them as an inheritance in the land of the LORD as male servants and female servants; and they will take their captors captive and will rule over their oppressors.
Isaiah	Isa	23	14	3	And it will be in the day when the LORD gives you rest from your pain and turmoil and harsh service in which you have been enslaved,
Isaiah	Isa	23	14	4	that you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon, and say, "How the oppressor has ceased, And how fury has ceased!
Isaiah	Isa	23	14	5	"The LORD has broken the staff of the wicked, The scepter of rulers
Isaiah	Isa	23	14	6	Which used to strike the peoples in fury with unceasing strokes, Which subdued the nations in anger with unrestrained persecution.
Isaiah	Isa	23	14	7	"The whole earth is at rest and is quiet; They break forth into shouts of joy.
Isaiah	Isa	23	14	8	"Even the cypress trees rejoice over you, and the cedars of Lebanon, saying, 'Since you were laid low, no tree cutter comes up against us.'
Isaiah	Isa	23	14	9	"Sheol from beneath is excited over you to meet you when you come; It arouses for you the spirits of the dead, all the leaders of the earth; It raises all the kings of the nations from their thrones.
Isaiah	Isa	23	14	10	"They will all respond and say to you, 'Even you have been made weak as we, You have become like us.
Isaiah	Isa	23	14	11	'Your pomp and the music of your harps Have been brought down to Sheol; Maggots are spread out as your bed beneath you And worms are your covering.'
Isaiah	Isa	23	14	12	"How you have fallen from heaven, O star of the morning, son of the dawn! You have been cut down to the earth, You who have weakened the nations!
Isaiah	Isa	23	14	13	"But you said in your heart, 'I will ascend to heaven; I will raise my throne above the stars of God, And I will sit on the mount of assembly In the recesses of the north.
Isaiah	Isa	23	14	14	'I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.'
Isaiah	Isa	23	14	15	"Nevertheless you will be thrust down to Sheol, To the recesses of the pit.
Isaiah	Isa	23	14	16	"Those who see you will gaze at you, They will ponder over you, saying, 'Is this the man who made the earth tremble, Who shook kingdoms,
Isaiah	Isa	23	14	17	Who made the world like a wilderness And overthrew its cities, Who did not allow his prisoners to go home?'
Isaiah	Isa	23	14	18	"All the kings of the nations lie in glory, Each in his own tomb.
Isaiah	Isa	23	14	19	"But you have been cast out of your tomb Like a rejected branch, Clothed with the slain who are pierced with a sword, Who go down to the stones of the pit Like a trampled corpse.
Isaiah	Isa	23	14	20	"You will not be united with them in burial, Because you have ruined your country, You have slain your people. May the offspring of evildoers not be mentioned forever.
Isaiah	Isa	23	14	21	"Prepare for his sons a place of slaughter Because of the iniquity of their fathers. They must not arise and take possession of the earth And fill the face of the world with cities."
Isaiah	Isa	23	14	22	"I will rise up against them," declares the LORD of hosts, "and will cut off from Babylon name and survivors, offspring and posterity," declares the LORD.
Isaiah	Isa	23	14	23	"I will also make it a possession for the hedgehog and swamps of water, and I will sweep it with the broom of destruction," declares the LORD of hosts.
Isaiah	Isa	23	14	24	The LORD of hosts has sworn saying, "Surely, just as I have intended so it has happened, and just as I have planned so it will stand,
Isaiah	Isa	23	14	25	to break Assyria in My land, and I will trample him on My mountains. Then his yoke will be removed from them and his burden removed from their shoulder.
Isaiah	Isa	23	14	26	"This is the plan devised against the whole earth; and this is the hand that is stretched out against all the nations.
Isaiah	Isa	23	14	27	"For the LORD of hosts has planned, and who can frustrate it? And as for His stretched-out hand, who can turn it back?"
Isaiah	Isa	23	14	28	In the year that King Ahaz died this oracle came:
Isaiah	Isa	23	14	29	"Do not rejoice, O Philistia, all of you, Because the rod that struck you is broken; For from the serpent's root a viper will come out, And its fruit will be a flying serpent.
Isaiah	Isa	23	14	30	"Those who are most helpless will eat, And the needy will lie down in security; I will destroy your root with famine, And it will kill off your survivors.
Isaiah	Isa	23	14	31	"Wail, O gate; cry, O city; Melt away, O Philistia, all of you; For smoke comes from the north, And there is no straggler in his ranks.
Isaiah	Isa	23	14	32	"How then will one answer the messengers of the nation? That the LORD has founded Zion, And the afflicted of His people will seek refuge in it."
Isaiah	Isa	23	15	1	The oracle concerning Moab. Surely in a night Ar of Moab is devastated and ruined; Surely in a night Kir of Moab is devastated and ruined.
Isaiah	Isa	23	15	2	They have gone up to the temple and to Dibon, even to the high places to weep. Moab wails over Nebo and Medeba; Everyone's head is bald and every beard is cut off.
Isaiah	Isa	23	15	3	In their streets they have girded themselves with sackcloth; On their housetops and in their squares Everyone is wailing, dissolved in tears.
Isaiah	Isa	23	15	4	Heshbon and Elealeh also cry out, Their voice is heard all the way to Jahaz; Therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud; His soul trembles within him.
Isaiah	Isa	23	15	5	My heart cries out for Moab; His fugitives are as far as Zoar and Eglath-shelishiyah, For they go up the ascent of Luhith weeping; Surely on the road to Horonaim they raise a cry of distress over their ruin.
Isaiah	Isa	23	15	6	For the waters of Nimrim are desolate. Surely the grass is withered, the tender grass died out, There is no green thing.
Isaiah	Isa	23	15	7	Therefore the abundance which they have acquired and stored up They carry off over the brook of Arabim.
Isaiah	Isa	23	15	8	For the cry of distress has gone around the territory of Moab, Its wail goes as far as Eglaim and its wailing even to Beer-elim.
Isaiah	Isa	23	15	9	For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; Surely I will bring added woes upon Dimon, A lion upon the fugitives of Moab and upon the remnant of the land.
Isaiah	Isa	23	16	1	Send the tribute lamb to the ruler of the land, From Sela by way of the wilderness to the mountain of the daughter of Zion.
Isaiah	Isa	23	16	2	Then, like fleeing birds or scattered nestlings, The daughters of Moab will be at the fords of the Arnon.
Isaiah	Isa	23	16	3	"Give us advice, make a decision; Cast your shadow like night at high noon; Hide the outcasts, do not betray the fugitive.
Isaiah	Isa	23	16	4	"Let the outcasts of Moab stay with you; Be a hiding place to them from the destroyer." For the extortioner has come to an end, destruction has ceased, Oppressors have completely disappeared from the land.
Isaiah	Isa	23	16	5	A throne will even be established in lovingkindness, And a judge will sit on it in faithfulness in the tent of David; Moreover, he will seek justice And be prompt in righteousness.
Isaiah	Isa	23	16	6	We have heard of the pride of Moab, an excessive pride; Even of his arrogance, pride, and fury; His idle boasts are false.
Isaiah	Isa	23	16	7	Therefore Moab will wail; everyone of Moab will wail. You will moan for the raisin cakes of Kir-hareseth As those who are utterly stricken.
Isaiah	Isa	23	16	8	For the fields of Heshbon have withered, the vines of Sibmah as well; The lords of the nations have trampled down its choice clusters Which reached as far as Jazer and wandered to the deserts; Its tendrils spread themselves out and passed over the sea.
Isaiah	Isa	23	16	9	Therefore I will weep bitterly for Jazer, for the vine of Sibmah; I will drench you with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealeh; For the shouting over your summer fruits and your harvest has fallen away.
Isaiah	Isa	23	16	10	Gladness and joy are taken away from the fruitful field; In the vineyards also there will be no cries of joy or jubilant shouting, No treader treads out wine in the presses, For I have made the shouting to cease.
Isaiah	Isa	23	16	11	Therefore my heart intones like a harp for Moab And my inward feelings for Kir-hareseth.
Isaiah	Isa	23	16	12	So it will come about when Moab presents himself, When he wearies himself upon his high place And comes to his sanctuary to pray, That he will not prevail.
Isaiah	Isa	23	16	13	This is the word which the LORD spoke earlier concerning Moab.
Isaiah	Isa	23	16	14	But now the LORD speaks, saying, "Within three years, as a hired man would count them, the glory of Moab will be degraded along with all his great population, and his remnant will be very small and impotent."
Isaiah	Isa	23	17	1	The oracle concerning Damascus. "Behold, Damascus is about to be removed from being a city And will become a fallen ruin.
Isaiah	Isa	23	17	2	"The cities of Aroer are forsaken; They will be for flocks to lie down in, And there will be no one to frighten them.
Isaiah	Isa	23	17	3	"The fortified city will disappear from Ephraim, And sovereignty from Damascus And the remnant of Aram; They will be like the glory of the sons of Israel," Declares the LORD of hosts.
Isaiah	Isa	23	17	4	Now in that day the glory of Jacob will fade, And the fatness of his flesh will become lean.
Isaiah	Isa	23	17	5	It will be even like the reaper gathering the standing grain, As his arm harvests the ears, Or it will be like one gleaning ears of grain In the valley of Rephaim.
Isaiah	Isa	23	17	6	Yet gleanings will be left in it like the shaking of an olive tree, Two or three olives on the topmost bough, Four or five on the branches of a fruitful tree, Declares the LORD, the God of Israel.
Isaiah	Isa	23	17	7	In that day man will have regard for his Maker And his eyes will look to the Holy One of Israel.
Isaiah	Isa	23	17	8	He will not have regard for the altars, the work of his hands, Nor will he look to that which his fingers have made, Even the Asherim and incense stands.
Isaiah	Isa	23	17	9	In that day their strong cities will be like forsaken places in the forest, Or like branches which they abandoned before the sons of Israel; And the land will be a desolation.
Isaiah	Isa	23	17	10	For you have forgotten the God of your salvation And have not remembered the rock of your refuge. Therefore you plant delightful plants And set them with vine slips of a strange god.
Isaiah	Isa	23	17	11	In the day that you plant it you carefully fence it in, And in the morning you bring your seed to blossom; But the harvest will be a heap In a day of sickliness and incurable pain.
Isaiah	Isa	23	17	12	Alas, the uproar of many peoples Who roar like the roaring of the seas, And the rumbling of nations Who rush on like the rumbling of mighty waters!
Isaiah	Isa	23	17	13	The nations rumble on like the rumbling of many waters, But He will rebuke them and they will flee far away, And be chased like chaff in the mountains before the wind, Or like whirling dust before a gale.
Isaiah	Isa	23	17	14	At evening time, behold, there is terror! Before morning they are no more. Such will be the portion of those who plunder us And the lot of those who pillage us.
Isaiah	Isa	23	18	1	Alas, oh land of whirring wings Which lies beyond the rivers of Cush,
Isaiah	Isa	23	18	2	Which sends envoys by the sea, Even in papyrus vessels on the surface of the waters. Go, swift messengers, to a nation tall and smooth, To a people feared far and wide, A powerful and oppressive nation Whose land the rivers divide.
Isaiah	Isa	23	18	3	All you inhabitants of the world and dwellers on earth, As soon as a standard is raised on the mountains, you will see it, And as soon as the trumpet is blown, you will hear it.
Isaiah	Isa	23	18	4	For thus the LORD has told me, "I will look from My dwelling place quietly Like dazzling heat in the sunshine, Like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest."
Isaiah	Isa	23	18	5	For before the harvest, as soon as the bud blossoms And the flower becomes a ripening grape, Then He will cut off the sprigs with pruning knives And remove and cut away the spreading branches.
Isaiah	Isa	23	18	6	They will be left together for mountain birds of prey, And for the beasts of the earth; And the birds of prey will spend the summer feeding on them, And all the beasts of the earth will spend harvest time on them.
Isaiah	Isa	23	18	7	At that time a gift of homage will be brought to the LORD of hosts From a people tall and smooth, Even from a people feared far and wide, A powerful and oppressive nation, Whose land the rivers divide-- To the place of the name of the LORD of hosts, even Mount Zion.
Isaiah	Isa	23	19	1	The oracle concerning Egypt. Behold, the LORD is riding on a swift cloud and is about to come to Egypt; The idols of Egypt will tremble at His presence, And the heart of the Egyptians will melt within them.
Isaiah	Isa	23	19	2	"So I will incite Egyptians against Egyptians; And they will each fight against his brother and each against his neighbor, City against city and kingdom against kingdom.
Isaiah	Isa	23	19	3	"Then the spirit of the Egyptians will be demoralized within them; And I will confound their strategy, So that they will resort to idols and ghosts of the dead And to mediums and spiritists.
Isaiah	Isa	23	19	4	"Moreover, I will deliver the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel master, And a mighty king will rule over them," declares the Lord GOD of hosts.
Isaiah	Isa	23	19	5	The waters from the sea will dry up, And the river will be parched and dry.
Isaiah	Isa	23	19	6	The canals will emit a stench, The streams of Egypt will thin out and dry up; The reeds and rushes will rot away.
Isaiah	Isa	23	19	7	The bulrushes by the Nile, by the edge of the Nile And all the sown fields by the Nile Will become dry, be driven away, and be no more.
Isaiah	Isa	23	19	8	And the fishermen will lament, And all those who cast a line into the Nile will mourn, And those who spread nets on the waters will pine away.
Isaiah	Isa	23	19	9	Moreover, the manufacturers of linen made from combed flax And the weavers of white cloth will be utterly dejected.
Isaiah	Isa	23	19	10	And the pillars of Egypt will be crushed; All the hired laborers will be grieved in soul.
Isaiah	Isa	23	19	11	The princes of Zoan are mere fools; The advice of Pharaoh's wisest advisers has become stupid. How can you men say to Pharaoh, "I am a son of the wise, a son of ancient kings"?
Isaiah	Isa	23	19	12	Well then, where are your wise men? Please let them tell you, And let them understand what the LORD of hosts Has purposed against Egypt.
Isaiah	Isa	23	19	13	The princes of Zoan have acted foolishly, The princes of Memphis are deluded; Those who are the cornerstone of her tribes Have led Egypt astray.
Isaiah	Isa	23	19	14	The LORD has mixed within her a spirit of distortion; They have led Egypt astray in all that it does, As a drunken man staggers in his vomit.
Isaiah	Isa	23	19	15	There will be no work for Egypt Which its head or tail, its palm branch or bulrush, may do.
Isaiah	Isa	23	19	16	In that day the Egyptians will become like women, and they will tremble and be in dread because of the waving of the hand of the LORD of hosts, which He is going to wave over them.
Isaiah	Isa	23	19	17	The land of Judah will become a terror to Egypt; everyone to whom it is mentioned will be in dread of it, because of the purpose of the LORD of hosts which He is purposing against them.
Isaiah	Isa	23	19	18	In that day five cities in the land of Egypt will be speaking the language of Canaan and swearing allegiance to the LORD of hosts; one will be called the City of Destruction.
Isaiah	Isa	23	19	19	In that day there will be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to the LORD near its border.
Isaiah	Isa	23	19	20	It will become a sign and a witness to the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt; for they will cry to the LORD because of oppressors, and He will send them a Savior and a Champion, and He will deliver them.
Isaiah	Isa	23	19	21	Thus the LORD will make Himself known to Egypt, and the Egyptians will know the LORD in that day. They will even worship with sacrifice and offering, and will make a vow to the LORD and perform it.
Isaiah	Isa	23	19	22	The LORD will strike Egypt, striking but healing; so they will return to the LORD, and He will respond to them and will heal them.
Isaiah	Isa	23	19	23	In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrians will come into Egypt and the Egyptians into Assyria, and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians.
Isaiah	Isa	23	19	24	In that day Israel will be the third party with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth,
Isaiah	Isa	23	19	25	whom the LORD of hosts has blessed, saying, "Blessed is Egypt My people, and Assyria the work of My hands, and Israel My inheritance."
Isaiah	Isa	23	20	1	In the year that the commander came to Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him and he fought against Ashdod and captured it,
Isaiah	Isa	23	20	2	at that time the LORD spoke through Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, "Go and loosen the sackcloth from your hips and take your shoes off your feet." And he did so, going naked and barefoot.
Isaiah	Isa	23	20	3	And the LORD said, "Even as My servant Isaiah has gone naked and barefoot three years as a sign and token against Egypt and Cush,
Isaiah	Isa	23	20	4	so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Cush, young and old, naked and barefoot with buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.
Isaiah	Isa	23	20	5	"Then they will be dismayed and ashamed because of Cush their hope and Egypt their boast.
Isaiah	Isa	23	20	6	"So the inhabitants of this coastland will say in that day, 'Behold, such is our hope, where we fled for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria; and we, how shall we escape?'"
Isaiah	Isa	23	21	1	The oracle concerning the wilderness of the sea. As windstorms in the Negev sweep on, It comes from the wilderness, from a terrifying land.
Isaiah	Isa	23	21	2	A harsh vision has been shown to me; The treacherous one still deals treacherously, and the destroyer still destroys. Go up, Elam, lay siege, Media; I have made an end of all the groaning she has caused.
Isaiah	Isa	23	21	3	For this reason my loins are full of anguish; Pains have seized me like the pains of a woman in labor. I am so bewildered I cannot hear, so terrified I cannot see.
Isaiah	Isa	23	21	4	My mind reels, horror overwhelms me; The twilight I longed for has been turned for me into trembling.
Isaiah	Isa	23	21	5	They set the table, they spread out the cloth, they eat, they drink; "Rise up, captains, oil the shields,"
Isaiah	Isa	23	21	6	For thus the Lord says to me, "Go, station the lookout, let him report what he sees.
Isaiah	Isa	23	21	7	"When he sees riders, horsemen in pairs, A train of donkeys, a train of camels, Let him pay close attention, very close attention."
Isaiah	Isa	23	21	8	Then the lookout called, "O Lord, I stand continually by day on the watchtower, And I am stationed every night at my guard post.
Isaiah	Isa	23	21	9	"Now behold, here comes a troop of riders, horsemen in pairs." And one said, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon; And all the images of her gods are shattered on the ground."
Isaiah	Isa	23	21	10	O my threshed people, and my afflicted of the threshing floor! What I have heard from the LORD of hosts, The God of Israel, I make known to you.
Isaiah	Isa	23	21	11	The oracle concerning Edom. One keeps calling to me from Seir, "Watchman, how far gone is the night? Watchman, how far gone is the night?"
Isaiah	Isa	23	21	12	The watchman says, "Morning comes but also night. If you would inquire, inquire; Come back again."
Isaiah	Isa	23	21	13	The oracle about Arabia. In the thickets of Arabia you must spend the night, O caravans of Dedanites.
Isaiah	Isa	23	21	14	Bring water for the thirsty, O inhabitants of the land of Tema, Meet the fugitive with bread.
Isaiah	Isa	23	21	15	For they have fled from the swords, From the drawn sword, and from the bent bow And from the press of battle.
Isaiah	Isa	23	21	16	For thus the Lord said to me, "In a year, as a hired man would count it, all the splendor of Kedar will terminate;
Isaiah	Isa	23	21	17	and the remainder of the number of bowmen, the mighty men of the sons of Kedar, will be few; for the LORD God of Israel has spoken."
Isaiah	Isa	23	22	1	The oracle concerning the valley of vision. What is the matter with you now, that you have all gone up to the housetops?
Isaiah	Isa	23	22	2	You who were full of noise, You boisterous town, you exultant city; Your slain were not slain with the sword, Nor did they die in battle.
Isaiah	Isa	23	22	3	All your rulers have fled together, And have been captured without the bow; All of you who were found were taken captive together, Though they had fled far away.
Isaiah	Isa	23	22	4	Therefore I say, "Turn your eyes away from me, Let me weep bitterly, Do not try to comfort me concerning the destruction of the daughter of my people."
Isaiah	Isa	23	22	5	For the Lord GOD of hosts has a day of panic, subjugation and confusion In the valley of vision, A breaking down of walls And a crying to the mountain.
Isaiah	Isa	23	22	6	Elam took up the quiver With the chariots, infantry and horsemen; And Kir uncovered the shield.
Isaiah	Isa	23	22	7	Then your choicest valleys were full of chariots, And the horsemen took up fixed positions at the gate.
Isaiah	Isa	23	22	8	And He removed the defense of Judah. In that day you depended on the weapons of the house of the forest,
Isaiah	Isa	23	22	9	And you saw that the breaches In the wall of the city of David were many; And you collected the waters of the lower pool.
Isaiah	Isa	23	22	10	Then you counted the houses of Jerusalem And tore down houses to fortify the wall.
Isaiah	Isa	23	22	11	And you made a reservoir between the two walls For the waters of the old pool. But you did not depend on Him who made it, Nor did you take into consideration Him who planned it long ago.
Isaiah	Isa	23	22	12	Therefore in that day the Lord GOD of hosts called you to weeping, to wailing, To shaving the head and to wearing sackcloth.
Isaiah	Isa	23	22	13	Instead, there is gaiety and gladness, Killing of cattle and slaughtering of sheep, Eating of meat and drinking of wine: "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we may die."
Isaiah	Isa	23	22	14	But the LORD of hosts revealed Himself to me, "Surely this iniquity shall not be forgiven you Until you die," says the Lord GOD of hosts.
Isaiah	Isa	23	22	15	Thus says the Lord GOD of hosts, "Come, go to this steward, To Shebna, who is in charge of the royal household,
Isaiah	Isa	23	22	16	'What right do you have here, And whom do you have here, That you have hewn a tomb for yourself here, You who hew a tomb on the height, You who carve a resting place for yourself in the rock?
Isaiah	Isa	23	22	17	'Behold, the LORD is about to hurl you headlong, O man. And He is about to grasp you firmly
Isaiah	Isa	23	22	18	And roll you tightly like a ball, To be cast into a vast country; There you will die And there your splendid chariots will be, You shame of your master's house.'
Isaiah	Isa	23	22	19	"I will depose you from your office, And I will pull you down from your station.
Isaiah	Isa	23	22	20	"Then it will come about in that day, That I will summon My servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah,
Isaiah	Isa	23	22	21	And I will clothe him with your tunic And tie your sash securely about him. I will entrust him with your authority, And he will become a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.
Isaiah	Isa	23	22	22	"Then I will set the key of the house of David on his shoulder, When he opens no one will shut, When he shuts no one will open.
Isaiah	Isa	23	22	23	"I will drive him like a peg in a firm place, And he will become a throne of glory to his father's house.
Isaiah	Isa	23	22	24	"So they will hang on him all the glory of his father's house, offspring and issue, all the least of vessels, from bowls to all the jars.
Isaiah	Isa	23	22	25	"In that day," declares the LORD of hosts, "the peg driven in a firm place will give way; it will even break off and fall, and the load hanging on it will be cut off, for the LORD has spoken."
Isaiah	Isa	23	23	1	The oracle concerning Tyre. Wail, O ships of Tarshish, For Tyre is destroyed, without house or harbor; It is reported to them from the land of Cyprus.
Isaiah	Isa	23	23	2	Be silent, you inhabitants of the coastland, You merchants of Sidon; Your messengers crossed the sea
Isaiah	Isa	23	23	3	And were on many waters. The grain of the Nile, the harvest of the River was her revenue; And she was the market of nations.
Isaiah	Isa	23	23	4	Be ashamed, O Sidon; For the sea speaks, the stronghold of the sea, saying, "I have neither travailed nor given birth, I have neither brought up young men nor reared virgins."
Isaiah	Isa	23	23	5	When the report reaches Egypt, They will be in anguish at the report of Tyre.
Isaiah	Isa	23	23	6	Pass over to Tarshish; Wail, O inhabitants of the coastland.
Isaiah	Isa	23	23	7	Is this your jubilant city, Whose origin is from antiquity, Whose feet used to carry her to colonize distant places?
Isaiah	Isa	23	23	8	Who has planned this against Tyre, the bestower of crowns, Whose merchants were princes, whose traders were the honored of the earth?
Isaiah	Isa	23	23	9	The LORD of hosts has planned it, to defile the pride of all beauty, To despise all the honored of the earth.
Isaiah	Isa	23	23	10	Overflow your land like the Nile, O daughter of Tarshish, There is no more restraint.
Isaiah	Isa	23	23	11	He has stretched His hand out over the sea, He has made the kingdoms tremble; The LORD has given a command concerning Canaan to demolish its strongholds.
Isaiah	Isa	23	23	12	He has said, "You shall exult no more, O crushed virgin daughter of Sidon. Arise, pass over to Cyprus; even there you will find no rest."
Isaiah	Isa	23	23	13	Behold, the land of the Chaldeans--this is the people which was not; Assyria appointed it for desert creatures--they erected their siege towers, they stripped its palaces, they made it a ruin.
Isaiah	Isa	23	23	14	Wail, O ships of Tarshish, For your stronghold is destroyed.
Isaiah	Isa	23	23	15	Now in that day Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years like the days of one king. At the end of seventy years it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the harlot:
Isaiah	Isa	23	23	16	Take your harp, walk about the city, O forgotten harlot; Pluck the strings skillfully, sing many songs, That you may be remembered.
Isaiah	Isa	23	23	17	It will come about at the end of seventy years that the LORD will visit Tyre. Then she will go back to her harlot's wages and will play the harlot with all the kingdoms on the face of the earth.
Isaiah	Isa	23	23	18	Her gain and her harlot's wages will be set apart to the LORD; it will not be stored up or hoarded, but her gain will become sufficient food and choice attire for those who dwell in the presence of the LORD.
Isaiah	Isa	23	24	1	Behold, the LORD lays the earth waste, devastates it, distorts its surface and scatters its inhabitants.
Isaiah	Isa	23	24	2	And the people will be like the priest, the servant like his master, the maid like her mistress, the buyer like the seller, the lender like the borrower, the creditor like the debtor.
Isaiah	Isa	23	24	3	The earth will be completely laid waste and completely despoiled, for the LORD has spoken this word.
Isaiah	Isa	23	24	4	The earth mourns and withers, the world fades and withers, the exalted of the people of the earth fade away.
Isaiah	Isa	23	24	5	The earth is also polluted by its inhabitants, for they transgressed laws, violated statutes, broke the everlasting covenant.
Isaiah	Isa	23	24	6	Therefore, a curse devours the earth, and those who live in it are held guilty. Therefore, the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men are left.
Isaiah	Isa	23	24	7	The new wine mourns, The vine decays, All the merry-hearted sigh.
Isaiah	Isa	23	24	8	The gaiety of tambourines ceases, The noise of revelers stops, The gaiety of the harp ceases.
Isaiah	Isa	23	24	9	They do not drink wine with song; Strong drink is bitter to those who drink it.
Isaiah	Isa	23	24	10	The city of chaos is broken down; Every house is shut up so that none may enter.
Isaiah	Isa	23	24	11	There is an outcry in the streets concerning the wine; All joy turns to gloom. The gaiety of the earth is banished.
Isaiah	Isa	23	24	12	Desolation is left in the city And the gate is battered to ruins.
Isaiah	Isa	23	24	13	For thus it will be in the midst of the earth among the peoples, As the shaking of an olive tree, As the gleanings when the grape harvest is over.
Isaiah	Isa	23	24	14	They raise their voices, they shout for joy; They cry out from the west concerning the majesty of the LORD.
Isaiah	Isa	23	24	15	Therefore glorify the LORD in the east, The name of the LORD, the God of Israel, In the coastlands of the sea.
Isaiah	Isa	23	24	16	From the ends of the earth we hear songs, "Glory to the Righteous One," But I say, "Woe to me! Woe to me! Alas for me! The treacherous deal treacherously, And the treacherous deal very treacherously."
Isaiah	Isa	23	24	17	Terror and pit and snare Confront you, O inhabitant of the earth.
Isaiah	Isa	23	24	18	Then it will be that he who flees the report of disaster will fall into the pit, And he who climbs out of the pit will be caught in the snare; For the windows above are opened, and the foundations of the earth shake.
Isaiah	Isa	23	24	19	The earth is broken asunder, The earth is split through, The earth is shaken violently.
Isaiah	Isa	23	24	20	The earth reels to and fro like a drunkard And it totters like a shack, For its transgression is heavy upon it, And it will fall, never to rise again.
Isaiah	Isa	23	24	21	So it will happen in that day, That the LORD will punish the host of heaven on high, And the kings of the earth on earth.
Isaiah	Isa	23	24	22	They will be gathered together Like prisoners in the dungeon, And will be confined in prison; And after many days they will be punished.
Isaiah	Isa	23	24	23	Then the moon will be abashed and the sun ashamed, For the LORD of hosts will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, And His glory will be before His elders.
Isaiah	Isa	23	25	1	O LORD, You are my God; I will exalt You, I will give thanks to Your name; For You have worked wonders, Plans formed long ago, with perfect faithfulness.
Isaiah	Isa	23	25	2	For You have made a city into a heap, A fortified city into a ruin; A palace of strangers is a city no more, It will never be rebuilt.
Isaiah	Isa	23	25	3	Therefore a strong people will glorify You; Cities of ruthless nations will revere You.
Isaiah	Isa	23	25	4	For You have been a defense for the helpless, A defense for the needy in his distress, A refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat; For the breath of the ruthless Is like a rain storm against a wall.
Isaiah	Isa	23	25	5	Like heat in drought, You subdue the uproar of aliens; Like heat by the shadow of a cloud, the song of the ruthless is silenced.
Isaiah	Isa	23	25	6	The LORD of hosts will prepare a lavish banquet for all peoples on this mountain; A banquet of aged wine, choice pieces with marrow, And refined, aged wine.
Isaiah	Isa	23	25	7	And on this mountain He will swallow up the covering which is over all peoples, Even the veil which is stretched over all nations.
Isaiah	Isa	23	25	8	He will swallow up death for all time, And the Lord GOD will wipe tears away from all faces, And He will remove the reproach of His people from all the earth; For the LORD has spoken.
Isaiah	Isa	23	25	9	And it will be said in that day, "Behold, this is our God for whom we have waited that He might save us. This is the LORD for whom we have waited; Let us rejoice and be glad in His salvation."
Isaiah	Isa	23	25	10	For the hand of the LORD will rest on this mountain, And Moab will be trodden down in his place As straw is trodden down in the water of a manure pile.
Isaiah	Isa	23	25	11	And he will spread out his hands in the middle of it As a swimmer spreads out his hands to swim, But the Lord will lay low his pride together with the trickery of his hands.
Isaiah	Isa	23	25	12	The unassailable fortifications of your walls He will bring down, Lay low and cast to the ground, even to the dust.
Isaiah	Isa	23	26	1	In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah: "We have a strong city; He sets up walls and ramparts for security.
Isaiah	Isa	23	26	2	"Open the gates, that the righteous nation may enter, The one that remains faithful.
Isaiah	Isa	23	26	3	"The steadfast of mind You will keep in perfect peace, Because he trusts in You.
Isaiah	Isa	23	26	4	"Trust in the LORD forever, For in GOD the LORD, we have an everlasting Rock.
Isaiah	Isa	23	26	5	"For He has brought low those who dwell on high, the unassailable city; He lays it low, He lays it low to the ground, He casts it to the dust.
Isaiah	Isa	23	26	6	"The foot will trample it, The feet of the afflicted, the steps of the helpless."
Isaiah	Isa	23	26	7	The way of the righteous is smooth; O Upright One, make the path of the righteous level.
Isaiah	Isa	23	26	8	Indeed, while following the way of Your judgments, O LORD, We have waited for You eagerly; Your name, even Your memory, is the desire of our souls.
Isaiah	Isa	23	26	9	At night my soul longs for You, Indeed, my spirit within me seeks You diligently; For when the earth experiences Your judgments The inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.
Isaiah	Isa	23	26	10	Though the wicked is shown favor, He does not learn righteousness; He deals unjustly in the land of uprightness, And does not perceive the majesty of the LORD.
Isaiah	Isa	23	26	11	O LORD, Your hand is lifted up yet they do not see it. They see Your zeal for the people and are put to shame; Indeed, fire will devour Your enemies.
Isaiah	Isa	23	26	12	LORD, You will establish peace for us, Since You have also performed for us all our works.
Isaiah	Isa	23	26	13	O LORD our God, other masters besides You have ruled us; But through You alone we confess Your name.
Isaiah	Isa	23	26	14	The dead will not live, the departed spirits will not rise; Therefore You have punished and destroyed them, And You have wiped out all remembrance of them.
Isaiah	Isa	23	26	15	You have increased the nation, O LORD, You have increased the nation, You are glorified; You have extended all the borders of the land.
Isaiah	Isa	23	26	16	O LORD, they sought You in distress; They could only whisper a prayer, Your chastening was upon them.
Isaiah	Isa	23	26	17	As the pregnant woman approaches the time to give birth, She writhes and cries out in her labor pains, Thus were we before You, O LORD.
Isaiah	Isa	23	26	18	We were pregnant, we writhed in labor, We gave birth, as it seems, only to wind. We could not accomplish deliverance for the earth, Nor were inhabitants of the world born.
Isaiah	Isa	23	26	19	Your dead will live; Their corpses will rise. You who lie in the dust, awake and shout for joy, For your dew is as the dew of the dawn, And the earth will give birth to the departed spirits.
Isaiah	Isa	23	26	20	Come, my people, enter into your rooms And close your doors behind you; Hide for a little while Until indignation runs its course.
Isaiah	Isa	23	26	21	For behold, the LORD is about to come out from His place To punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity; And the earth will reveal her bloodshed And will no longer cover her slain.
Isaiah	Isa	23	27	1	In that day the LORD will punish Leviathan the fleeing serpent, With His fierce and great and mighty sword, Even Leviathan the twisted serpent; And He will kill the dragon who lives in the sea.
Isaiah	Isa	23	27	2	In that day, "A vineyard of wine, sing of it!
Isaiah	Isa	23	27	3	"I, the LORD, am its keeper; I water it every moment. So that no one will damage it, I guard it night and day.
Isaiah	Isa	23	27	4	"I have no wrath. Should someone give Me briars and thorns in battle, Then I would step on them, I would burn them completely.
Isaiah	Isa	23	27	5	"Or let him rely on My protection, Let him make peace with Me, Let him make peace with Me."
Isaiah	Isa	23	27	6	In the days to come Jacob will take root, Israel will blossom and sprout, And they will fill the whole world with fruit.
Isaiah	Isa	23	27	7	Like the striking of Him who has struck them, has He struck them? Or like the slaughter of His slain, have they been slain?
Isaiah	Isa	23	27	8	You contended with them by banishing them, by driving them away. With His fierce wind He has expelled them on the day of the east wind.
Isaiah	Isa	23	27	9	Therefore through this Jacob's iniquity will be forgiven; And this will be the full price of the pardoning of his sin: When he makes all the altar stones like pulverized chalk stones; When Asherim and incense altars will not stand.
Isaiah	Isa	23	27	10	For the fortified city is isolated, A homestead forlorn and forsaken like the desert; There the calf will graze, And there it will lie down and feed on its branches.
Isaiah	Isa	23	27	11	When its limbs are dry, they are broken off; Women come and make a fire with them, For they are not a people of discernment, Therefore their Maker will not have compassion on them. And their Creator will not be gracious to them.
Isaiah	Isa	23	27	12	In that day the LORD will start His threshing from the flowing stream of the Euphrates to the brook of Egypt, and you will be gathered up one by one, O sons of Israel.
Isaiah	Isa	23	27	13	It will come about also in that day that a great trumpet will be blown, and those who were perishing in the land of Assyria and who were scattered in the land of Egypt will come and worship the LORD in the holy mountain at Jerusalem.
Isaiah	Isa	23	28	1	Woe to the proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim, And to the fading flower of its glorious beauty, Which is at the head of the fertile valley Of those who are overcome with wine!
Isaiah	Isa	23	28	2	Behold, the Lord has a strong and mighty agent; As a storm of hail, a tempest of destruction, Like a storm of mighty overflowing waters, He has cast it down to the earth with His hand.
Isaiah	Isa	23	28	3	The proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim is trodden under foot.
Isaiah	Isa	23	28	4	And the fading flower of its glorious beauty, Which is at the head of the fertile valley, Will be like the first-ripe fig prior to summer, Which one sees, And as soon as it is in his hand, He swallows it.
Isaiah	Isa	23	28	5	In that day the LORD of hosts will become a beautiful crown And a glorious diadem to the remnant of His people;
Isaiah	Isa	23	28	6	A spirit of justice for him who sits in judgment, A strength to those who repel the onslaught at the gate.
Isaiah	Isa	23	28	7	And these also reel with wine and stagger from strong drink: The priest and the prophet reel with strong drink, They are confused by wine, they stagger from strong drink; They reel while having visions, They totter when rendering judgment.
Isaiah	Isa	23	28	8	For all the tables are full of filthy vomit, without a single clean place.
Isaiah	Isa	23	28	9	"To whom would He teach knowledge, And to whom would He interpret the message? Those just weaned from milk? Those just taken from the breast?
Isaiah	Isa	23	28	10	"For He says, 'Order on order, order on order, Line on line, line on line, A little here, a little there.'"
Isaiah	Isa	23	28	11	Indeed, He will speak to this people Through stammering lips and a foreign tongue,
Isaiah	Isa	23	28	12	He who said to them, "Here is rest, give rest to the weary," And, "Here is repose," but they would not listen.
Isaiah	Isa	23	28	13	So the word of the LORD to them will be, "Order on order, order on order, Line on line, line on line, A little here, a little there," That they may go and stumble backward, be broken, snared and taken captive.
Isaiah	Isa	23	28	14	Therefore, hear the word of the LORD, O scoffers, Who rule this people who are in Jerusalem,
Isaiah	Isa	23	28	15	Because you have said, "We have made a covenant with death, And with Sheol we have made a pact. The overwhelming scourge will not reach us when it passes by, For we have made falsehood our refuge and we have concealed ourselves with deception."
Isaiah	Isa	23	28	16	Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone, a tested stone, A costly cornerstone for the foundation, firmly placed. He who believes in it will not be disturbed.
Isaiah	Isa	23	28	17	"I will make justice the measuring line And righteousness the level; Then hail will sweep away the refuge of lies And the waters will overflow the secret place.
Isaiah	Isa	23	28	18	"Your covenant with death will be canceled, And your pact with Sheol will not stand; When the overwhelming scourge passes through, Then you become its trampling place.
Isaiah	Isa	23	28	19	"As often as it passes through, it will seize you; For morning after morning it will pass through, anytime during the day or night, And it will be sheer terror to understand what it means."
Isaiah	Isa	23	28	20	The bed is too short on which to stretch out, And the blanket is too small to wrap oneself in.
Isaiah	Isa	23	28	21	For the LORD will rise up as at Mount Perazim, He will be stirred up as in the valley of Gibeon, To do His task, His unusual task, And to work His work, His extraordinary work.
Isaiah	Isa	23	28	22	And now do not carry on as scoffers, Or your fetters will be made stronger; For I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts Of decisive destruction on all the earth.
Isaiah	Isa	23	28	23	Give ear and hear my voice, Listen and hear my words.
Isaiah	Isa	23	28	24	Does the farmer plow continually to plant seed? Does he continually turn and harrow the ground?
Isaiah	Isa	23	28	25	Does he not level its surface And sow dill and scatter cummin And plant wheat in rows, Barley in its place and rye within its area?
Isaiah	Isa	23	28	26	For his God instructs and teaches him properly.
Isaiah	Isa	23	28	27	For dill is not threshed with a threshing sledge, Nor is the cartwheel driven over cummin; But dill is beaten out with a rod, and cummin with a club.
Isaiah	Isa	23	28	28	Grain for bread is crushed, Indeed, he does not continue to thresh it forever. Because the wheel of his cart and his horses eventually damage it, He does not thresh it longer.
Isaiah	Isa	23	28	29	This also comes from the LORD of hosts, Who has made His counsel wonderful and His wisdom great.
Isaiah	Isa	23	29	1	Woe, O Ariel, Ariel the city where David once camped! Add year to year, observe your feasts on schedule.
Isaiah	Isa	23	29	2	I will bring distress to Ariel, And she will be a city of lamenting and mourning; And she will be like an Ariel to me.
Isaiah	Isa	23	29	3	I will camp against you encircling you, And I will set siegeworks against you, And I will raise up battle towers against you.
Isaiah	Isa	23	29	4	Then you will be brought low; From the earth you will speak, And from the dust where you are prostrate Your words will come. Your voice will also be like that of a spirit from the ground, And your speech will whisper from the dust.
Isaiah	Isa	23	29	5	But the multitude of your enemies will become like fine dust, And the multitude of the ruthless ones like the chaff which blows away; And it will happen instantly, suddenly.
Isaiah	Isa	23	29	6	From the LORD of hosts you will be punished with thunder and earthquake and loud noise, With whirlwind and tempest and the flame of a consuming fire.
Isaiah	Isa	23	29	7	And the multitude of all the nations who wage war against Ariel, Even all who wage war against her and her stronghold, and who distress her, Will be like a dream, a vision of the night.
Isaiah	Isa	23	29	8	It will be as when a hungry man dreams-- And behold, he is eating; But when he awakens, his hunger is not satisfied, Or as when a thirsty man dreams-- And behold, he is drinking, But when he awakens, behold, he is faint And his thirst is not quenched. Thus the multitude of all the nations will be Who wage war against Mount Zion.
Isaiah	Isa	23	29	9	Be delayed and wait, Blind yourselves and be blind; They become drunk, but not with wine, They stagger, but not with strong drink.
Isaiah	Isa	23	29	10	For the LORD has poured over you a spirit of deep sleep, He has shut your eyes, the prophets; And He has covered your heads, the seers.
Isaiah	Isa	23	29	11	The entire vision will be to you like the words of a sealed book, which when they give it to the one who is literate, saying, "Please read this," he will say, "I cannot, for it is sealed."
Isaiah	Isa	23	29	12	Then the book will be given to the one who is illiterate, saying, "Please read this." And he will say, "I cannot read."
Isaiah	Isa	23	29	13	Then the Lord said, "Because this people draw near with their words And honor Me with their lip service, But they remove their hearts far from Me, And their reverence for Me consists of tradition learned by rote,
Isaiah	Isa	23	29	14	Therefore behold, I will once again deal marvelously with this people, wondrously marvelous; And the wisdom of their wise men will perish, And the discernment of their discerning men will be concealed."
Isaiah	Isa	23	29	15	Woe to those who deeply hide their plans from the LORD, And whose deeds are done in a dark place, And they say, "Who sees us?" or "Who knows us?"
Isaiah	Isa	23	29	16	You turn things around! Shall the potter be considered as equal with the clay, That what is made would say to its maker, "He did not make me"; Or what is formed say to him who formed it, "He has no understanding"?
Isaiah	Isa	23	29	17	Is it not yet just a little while Before Lebanon will be turned into a fertile field, And the fertile field will be considered as a forest?
Isaiah	Isa	23	29	18	On that day the deaf will hear words of a book, And out of their gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind will see.
Isaiah	Isa	23	29	19	The afflicted also will increase their gladness in the LORD, And the needy of mankind will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
Isaiah	Isa	23	29	20	For the ruthless will come to an end and the scorner will be finished, Indeed all who are intent on doing evil will be cut off;
Isaiah	Isa	23	29	21	Who cause a person to be indicted by a word, And ensnare him who adjudicates at the gate, And defraud the one in the right with meaningless arguments.
Isaiah	Isa	23	29	22	Therefore thus says the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: "Jacob shall not now be ashamed, nor shall his face now turn pale;
Isaiah	Isa	23	29	23	But when he sees his children, the work of My hands, in his midst, They will sanctify My name; Indeed, they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob And will stand in awe of the God of Israel.
Isaiah	Isa	23	29	24	"Those who err in mind will know the truth, And those who criticize will accept instruction.
Isaiah	Isa	23	30	1	"Woe to the rebellious children," declares the LORD, "Who execute a plan, but not Mine, And make an alliance, but not of My Spirit, In order to add sin to sin;
Isaiah	Isa	23	30	2	Who proceed down to Egypt Without consulting Me, To take refuge in the safety of Pharaoh And to seek shelter in the shadow of Egypt!
Isaiah	Isa	23	30	3	"Therefore the safety of Pharaoh will be your shame And the shelter in the shadow of Egypt, your humiliation.
Isaiah	Isa	23	30	4	"For their princes are at Zoan And their ambassadors arrive at Hanes.
Isaiah	Isa	23	30	5	"Everyone will be ashamed because of a people who cannot profit them, Who are not for help or profit, but for shame and also for reproach."
Isaiah	Isa	23	30	6	The oracle concerning the beasts of the Negev. Through a land of distress and anguish, From where come lioness and lion, viper and flying serpent, They carry their riches on the backs of young donkeys And their treasures on camels' humps, To a people who cannot profit them;
Isaiah	Isa	23	30	7	Even Egypt, whose help is vain and empty. Therefore, I have called her "Rahab who has been exterminated."
Isaiah	Isa	23	30	8	Now go, write it on a tablet before them And inscribe it on a scroll, That it may serve in the time to come As a witness forever.
Isaiah	Isa	23	30	9	For this is a rebellious people, false sons, Sons who refuse to listen To the instruction of the LORD;
Isaiah	Isa	23	30	10	Who say to the seers, "You must not see visions"; And to the prophets, "You must not prophesy to us what is right, Speak to us pleasant words, Prophesy illusions.
Isaiah	Isa	23	30	11	"Get out of the way, turn aside from the path, Let us hear no more about the Holy One of Israel."
Isaiah	Isa	23	30	12	Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel, "Since you have rejected this word And have put your trust in oppression and guile, and have relied on them,
Isaiah	Isa	23	30	13	Therefore this iniquity will be to you Like a breach about to fall, A bulge in a high wall, Whose collapse comes suddenly in an instant,
Isaiah	Isa	23	30	14	Whose collapse is like the smashing of a potter's jar, So ruthlessly shattered That a sherd will not be found among its pieces To take fire from a hearth Or to scoop water from a cistern."
Isaiah	Isa	23	30	15	For thus the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel, has said, "In repentance and rest you will be saved, In quietness and trust is your strength." But you were not willing,
Isaiah	Isa	23	30	16	And you said, "No, for we will flee on horses," Therefore you shall flee! "And we will ride on swift horses," Therefore those who pursue you shall be swift.
Isaiah	Isa	23	30	17	One thousand will flee at the threat of one man; You will flee at the threat of five, Until you are left as a flag on a mountain top And as a signal on a hill.
Isaiah	Isa	23	30	18	Therefore the LORD longs to be gracious to you, And therefore He waits on high to have compassion on you. For the LORD is a God of justice; How blessed are all those who long for Him.
Isaiah	Isa	23	30	19	O people in Zion, inhabitant in Jerusalem, you will weep no longer. He will surely be gracious to you at the sound of your cry; when He hears it, He will answer you.
Isaiah	Isa	23	30	20	Although the Lord has given you bread of privation and water of oppression, He, your Teacher will no longer hide Himself, but your eyes will behold your Teacher.
Isaiah	Isa	23	30	21	Your ears will hear a word behind you, "This is the way, walk in it," whenever you turn to the right or to the left.
Isaiah	Isa	23	30	22	And you will defile your graven images overlaid with silver, and your molten images plated with gold. You will scatter them as an impure thing, and say to them, "Be gone!"
Isaiah	Isa	23	30	23	Then He will give you rain for the seed which you will sow in the ground, and bread from the yield of the ground, and it will be rich and plenteous; on that day your livestock will graze in a roomy pasture.
Isaiah	Isa	23	30	24	Also the oxen and the donkeys which work the ground will eat salted fodder, which has been winnowed with shovel and fork.
Isaiah	Isa	23	30	25	On every lofty mountain and on every high hill there will be streams running with water on the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.
Isaiah	Isa	23	30	26	The light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven times brighter, like the light of seven days, on the day the LORD binds up the fracture of His people and heals the bruise He has inflicted.
Isaiah	Isa	23	30	27	Behold, the name of the LORD comes from a remote place; Burning is His anger and dense is His smoke; His lips are filled with indignation And His tongue is like a consuming fire;
Isaiah	Isa	23	30	28	His breath is like an overflowing torrent, Which reaches to the neck, To shake the nations back and forth in a sieve, And to put in the jaws of the peoples the bridle which leads to ruin.
Isaiah	Isa	23	30	29	You will have songs as in the night when you keep the festival, And gladness of heart as when one marches to the sound of the flute, To go to the mountain of the LORD, to the Rock of Israel.
Isaiah	Isa	23	30	30	And the LORD will cause His voice of authority to be heard, And the descending of His arm to be seen in fierce anger, And in the flame of a consuming fire In cloudburst, downpour and hailstones.
Isaiah	Isa	23	30	31	For at the voice of the LORD Assyria will be terrified, When He strikes with the rod.
Isaiah	Isa	23	30	32	And every blow of the rod of punishment, Which the LORD will lay on him, Will be with the music of tambourines and lyres; And in battles, brandishing weapons, He will fight them.
Isaiah	Isa	23	30	33	For Topheth has long been ready, Indeed, it has been prepared for the king. He has made it deep and large, A pyre of fire with plenty of wood; The breath of the LORD, like a torrent of brimstone, sets it afire.
Isaiah	Isa	23	31	1	Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help And rely on horses, And trust in chariots because they are many And in horsemen because they are very strong, But they do not look to the Holy One of Israel, nor seek the LORD!
Isaiah	Isa	23	31	2	Yet He also is wise and will bring disaster And does not retract His words, But will arise against the house of evildoers And against the help of the workers of iniquity.
Isaiah	Isa	23	31	3	Now the Egyptians are men and not God, And their horses are flesh and not spirit; So the LORD will stretch out His hand, And he who helps will stumble And he who is helped will fall, And all of them will come to an end together.
Isaiah	Isa	23	31	4	For thus says the LORD to me, "As the lion or the young lion growls over his prey, Against which a band of shepherds is called out, And he will not be terrified at their voice nor disturbed at their noise, So will the LORD of hosts come down to wage war on Mount Zion and on its hill."
Isaiah	Isa	23	31	5	Like flying birds so the LORD of hosts will protect Jerusalem. He will protect and deliver it; He will pass over and rescue it.
Isaiah	Isa	23	31	6	Return to Him from whom you have deeply defected, O sons of Israel.
Isaiah	Isa	23	31	7	For in that day every man will cast away his silver idols and his gold idols, which your sinful hands have made for you as a sin.
Isaiah	Isa	23	31	8	And the Assyrian will fall by a sword not of man, And a sword not of man will devour him. So he will not escape the sword, And his young men will become forced laborers.
Isaiah	Isa	23	31	9	"His rock will pass away because of panic, And his princes will be terrified at the standard," Declares the LORD, whose fire is in Zion and whose furnace is in Jerusalem.
Isaiah	Isa	23	32	1	Behold, a king will reign righteously And princes will rule justly.
Isaiah	Isa	23	32	2	Each will be like a refuge from the wind And a shelter from the storm, Like streams of water in a dry country, Like the shade of a huge rock in a parched land.
Isaiah	Isa	23	32	3	Then the eyes of those who see will not be blinded, And the ears of those who hear will listen.
Isaiah	Isa	23	32	4	The mind of the hasty will discern the truth, And the tongue of the stammerers will hasten to speak clearly.
Isaiah	Isa	23	32	5	No longer will the fool be called noble, Or the rogue be spoken of as generous.
Isaiah	Isa	23	32	6	For a fool speaks nonsense, And his heart inclines toward wickedness: To practice ungodliness and to speak error against the LORD, To keep the hungry person unsatisfied And to withhold drink from the thirsty.
Isaiah	Isa	23	32	7	As for a rogue, his weapons are evil; He devises wicked schemes To destroy the afflicted with slander, Even though the needy one speaks what is right.
Isaiah	Isa	23	32	8	But the noble man devises noble plans; And by noble plans he stands.
Isaiah	Isa	23	32	9	Rise up, you women who are at ease, And hear my voice; Give ear to my word, You complacent daughters.
Isaiah	Isa	23	32	10	Within a year and a few days You will be troubled, O complacent daughters; For the vintage is ended, And the fruit gathering will not come.
Isaiah	Isa	23	32	11	Tremble, you women who are at ease; Be troubled, you complacent daughters; Strip, undress and put sackcloth on your waist,
Isaiah	Isa	23	32	12	Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine,
Isaiah	Isa	23	32	13	For the land of my people in which thorns and briars shall come up; Yea, for all the joyful houses and for the jubilant city.
Isaiah	Isa	23	32	14	Because the palace has been abandoned, the populated city forsaken. Hill and watch-tower have become caves forever, A delight for wild donkeys, a pasture for flocks;
Isaiah	Isa	23	32	15	Until the Spirit is poured out upon us from on high, And the wilderness becomes a fertile field, And the fertile field is considered as a forest.
Isaiah	Isa	23	32	16	Then justice will dwell in the wilderness And righteousness will abide in the fertile field.
Isaiah	Isa	23	32	17	And the work of righteousness will be peace, And the service of righteousness, quietness and confidence forever.
Isaiah	Isa	23	32	18	Then my people will live in a peaceful habitation, And in secure dwellings and in undisturbed resting places;
Isaiah	Isa	23	32	19	And it will hail when the forest comes down, And the city will be utterly laid low.
Isaiah	Isa	23	32	20	How blessed will you be, you who sow beside all waters, Who let out freely the ox and the donkey.
Isaiah	Isa	23	33	1	Woe to you, O destroyer, While you were not destroyed; And he who is treacherous, while others did not deal treacherously with him. As soon as you finish destroying, you will be destroyed; As soon as you cease to deal treacherously, others will deal treacherously with you.
Isaiah	Isa	23	33	2	O LORD, be gracious to us; we have waited for You. Be their strength every morning, Our salvation also in the time of distress.
Isaiah	Isa	23	33	3	At the sound of the tumult peoples flee; At the lifting up of Yourself nations disperse.
Isaiah	Isa	23	33	4	Your spoil is gathered as the caterpillar gathers; As locusts rushing about men rush about on it.
Isaiah	Isa	23	33	5	The LORD is exalted, for He dwells on high; He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness.
Isaiah	Isa	23	33	6	And He will be the stability of your times, A wealth of salvation, wisdom and knowledge; The fear of the LORD is his treasure.
Isaiah	Isa	23	33	7	Behold, their brave men cry in the streets, The ambassadors of peace weep bitterly.
Isaiah	Isa	23	33	8	The highways are desolate, the traveler has ceased, He has broken the covenant, he has despised the cities, He has no regard for man.
Isaiah	Isa	23	33	9	The land mourns and pines away, Lebanon is shamed and withers; Sharon is like a desert plain, And Bashan and Carmel lose their foliage.
Isaiah	Isa	23	33	10	"Now I will arise," says the LORD, "Now I will be exalted, now I will be lifted up.
Isaiah	Isa	23	33	11	"You have conceived chaff, you will give birth to stubble; My breath will consume you like a fire.
Isaiah	Isa	23	33	12	"The peoples will be burned to lime, Like cut thorns which are burned in the fire.
Isaiah	Isa	23	33	13	"You who are far away, hear what I have done; And you who are near, acknowledge My might."
Isaiah	Isa	23	33	14	Sinners in Zion are terrified; Trembling has seized the godless. "Who among us can live with the consuming fire? Who among us can live with continual burning?"
Isaiah	Isa	23	33	15	He who walks righteously and speaks with sincerity, He who rejects unjust gain And shakes his hands so that they hold no bribe; He who stops his ears from hearing about bloodshed And shuts his eyes from looking upon evil;
Isaiah	Isa	23	33	16	He will dwell on the heights, His refuge will be the impregnable rock; His bread will be given him, His water will be sure.
Isaiah	Isa	23	33	17	Your eyes will see the King in His beauty; They will behold a far-distant land.
Isaiah	Isa	23	33	18	Your heart will meditate on terror: "Where is he who counts? Where is he who weighs? Where is he who counts the towers?"
Isaiah	Isa	23	33	19	You will no longer see a fierce people, A people of unintelligible speech which no one comprehends, Of a stammering tongue which no one understands.
Isaiah	Isa	23	33	20	Look upon Zion, the city of our appointed feasts; Your eyes will see Jerusalem, an undisturbed habitation, A tent which will not be folded; Its stakes will never be pulled up, Nor any of its cords be torn apart.
Isaiah	Isa	23	33	21	But there the majestic One, the LORD, will be for us A place of rivers and wide canals On which no boat with oars will go, And on which no mighty ship will pass--
Isaiah	Isa	23	33	22	For the LORD is our judge, The LORD is our lawgiver, The LORD is our king; He will save us--
Isaiah	Isa	23	33	23	Your tackle hangs slack; It cannot hold the base of its mast firmly, Nor spread out the sail. Then the prey of an abundant spoil will be divided; The lame will take the plunder.
Isaiah	Isa	23	33	24	And no resident will say, "I am sick"; The people who dwell there will be forgiven their iniquity.
Isaiah	Isa	23	34	1	Draw near, O nations, to hear; and listen, O peoples! Let the earth and all it contains hear, and the world and all that springs from it.
Isaiah	Isa	23	34	2	For the LORD'S indignation is against all the nations, And His wrath against all their armies; He has utterly destroyed them, He has given them over to slaughter.
Isaiah	Isa	23	34	3	So their slain will be thrown out, And their corpses will give off their stench, And the mountains will be drenched with their blood.
Isaiah	Isa	23	34	4	And all the host of heaven will wear away, And the sky will be rolled up like a scroll; All their hosts will also wither away As a leaf withers from the vine, Or as one withers from the fig tree.
Isaiah	Isa	23	34	5	For My sword is satiated in heaven, Behold it shall descend for judgment upon Edom And upon the people whom I have devoted to destruction.
Isaiah	Isa	23	34	6	The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, It is sated with fat, with the blood of lambs and goats, With the fat of the kidneys of rams. For the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah And a great slaughter in the land of Edom.
Isaiah	Isa	23	34	7	Wild oxen will also fall with them And young bulls with strong ones; Thus their land will be soaked with blood, And their dust become greasy with fat.
Isaiah	Isa	23	34	8	For the LORD has a day of vengeance, A year of recompense for the cause of Zion.
Isaiah	Isa	23	34	9	Its streams will be turned into pitch, And its loose earth into brimstone, And its land will become burning pitch.
Isaiah	Isa	23	34	10	It will not be quenched night or day; Its smoke will go up forever. From generation to generation it will be desolate; None will pass through it forever and ever.
Isaiah	Isa	23	34	11	But pelican and hedgehog will possess it, And owl and raven will dwell in it; And He will stretch over it the line of desolation And the plumb line of emptiness.
Isaiah	Isa	23	34	12	Its nobles--there is no one there Whom they may proclaim king-- And all its princes will be nothing.
Isaiah	Isa	23	34	13	Thorns will come up in its fortified towers, Nettles and thistles in its fortified cities; It will also be a haunt of jackals And an abode of ostriches.
Isaiah	Isa	23	34	14	The desert creatures will meet with the wolves, The hairy goat also will cry to its kind; Yes, the night monster will settle there And will find herself a resting place.
Isaiah	Isa	23	34	15	The tree snake will make its nest and lay eggs there, And it will hatch and gather them under its protection. Yes, the hawks will be gathered there, Every one with its kind.
Isaiah	Isa	23	34	16	Seek from the book of the LORD, and read: Not one of these will be missing; None will lack its mate. For His mouth has commanded, And His Spirit has gathered them.
Isaiah	Isa	23	34	17	He has cast the lot for them, And His hand has divided it to them by line. They shall possess it forever; From generation to generation they will dwell in it.
Isaiah	Isa	23	35	1	The wilderness and the desert will be glad, And the Arabah will rejoice and blossom; Like the crocus
Isaiah	Isa	23	35	2	It will blossom profusely And rejoice with rejoicing and shout of joy. The glory of Lebanon will be given to it, The majesty of Carmel and Sharon. They will see the glory of the LORD, The majesty of our God.
Isaiah	Isa	23	35	3	Encourage the exhausted, and strengthen the feeble.
Isaiah	Isa	23	35	4	Say to those with anxious heart, "Take courage, fear not. Behold, your God will come with vengeance; The recompense of God will come, But He will save you."
Isaiah	Isa	23	35	5	Then the eyes of the blind will be opened And the ears of the deaf will be unstopped.
Isaiah	Isa	23	35	6	Then the lame will leap like a deer, And the tongue of the mute will shout for joy. For waters will break forth in the wilderness And streams in the Arabah.
Isaiah	Isa	23	35	7	The scorched land will become a pool And the thirsty ground springs of water; In the haunt of jackals, its resting place, Grass becomes reeds and rushes.
Isaiah	Isa	23	35	8	A highway will be there, a roadway, And it will be called the Highway of Holiness. The unclean will not travel on it, But it will be for him who walks that way, And fools will not wander on it.
Isaiah	Isa	23	35	9	No lion will be there, Nor will any vicious beast go up on it; These will not be found there. But the redeemed will walk there,
Isaiah	Isa	23	35	10	And the ransomed of the LORD will return And come with joyful shouting to Zion, With everlasting joy upon their heads. They will find gladness and joy, And sorrow and sighing will flee away.
Isaiah	Isa	23	36	1	Now in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and seized them.
Isaiah	Isa	23	36	2	And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to King Hezekiah with a large army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool on the highway of the fuller's field.
Isaiah	Isa	23	36	3	Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came out to him.
Isaiah	Isa	23	36	4	Then Rabshakeh said to them, "Say now to Hezekiah, 'Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, "What is this confidence that you have?
Isaiah	Isa	23	36	5	"I say, 'Your counsel and strength for the war are only empty words.' Now on whom do you rely, that you have rebelled against me?
Isaiah	Isa	23	36	6	"Behold, you rely on the staff of this crushed reed, even on Egypt, on which if a man leans, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who rely on him.
Isaiah	Isa	23	36	7	"But if you say to me, 'We trust in the LORD our God,' is it not He whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, 'You shall worship before this altar'?
Isaiah	Isa	23	36	8	"Now therefore, come make a bargain with my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them.
Isaiah	Isa	23	36	9	"How then can you repulse one official of the least of my master's servants and rely on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
Isaiah	Isa	23	36	10	"Have I now come up without the LORD'S approval against this land to destroy it? The LORD said to me, 'Go up against this land and destroy it.'"'"
Isaiah	Isa	23	36	11	Then Eliakim and Shebna and Joah said to Rabshakeh, "Speak now to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it; and do not speak with us in Judean in the hearing of the people who are on the wall."
Isaiah	Isa	23	36	12	But Rabshakeh said, "Has my master sent me only to your master and to you to speak these words, and not to the men who sit on the wall, doomed to eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?"
Isaiah	Isa	23	36	13	Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in Judean and said, "Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.
Isaiah	Isa	23	36	14	"Thus says the king, 'Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you;
Isaiah	Isa	23	36	15	nor let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, "The LORD will surely deliver us, this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria."
Isaiah	Isa	23	36	16	'Do not listen to Hezekiah,' for thus says the king of Assyria, 'Make your peace with me and come out to me, and eat each of his vine and each of his fig tree and drink each of the waters of his own cistern,
Isaiah	Isa	23	36	17	until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
Isaiah	Isa	23	36	18	'Beware that Hezekiah does not mislead you, saying, "The LORD will deliver us." Has any one of the gods of the nations delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria?
Isaiah	Isa	23	36	19	'Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? And when have they delivered Samaria from my hand?
Isaiah	Isa	23	36	20	'Who among all the gods of these lands have delivered their land from my hand, that the LORD would deliver Jerusalem from my hand?'"
Isaiah	Isa	23	36	21	But they were silent and answered him not a word; for the king's commandment was, "Do not answer him."
Isaiah	Isa	23	36	22	Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and told him the words of Rabshakeh.
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	1	And when King Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth and entered the house of the LORD.
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	2	Then he sent Eliakim who was over the household with Shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz.
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	3	They said to him, "Thus says Hezekiah, 'This day is a day of distress, rebuke and rejection; for children have come to birth, and there is no strength to deliver.
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	4	'Perhaps the LORD your God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to reproach the living God, and will rebuke the words which the LORD your God has heard. Therefore, offer a prayer for the remnant that is left.'"
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	5	So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	6	Isaiah said to them, "Thus you shall say to your master, 'Thus says the LORD, "Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me.
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	7	"Behold, I will put a spirit in him so that he will hear a rumor and return to his own land. And I will make him fall by the sword in his own land."'"
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	8	Then Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he had heard that the king had left Lachish.
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	9	When he heard them say concerning Tirhakah king of Cush, "He has come out to fight against you," and when he heard it he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	10	"Thus you shall say to Hezekiah king of Judah, 'Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, "Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria."
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	11	'Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands, destroying them completely. So will you be spared?
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	12	'Did the gods of those nations which my fathers have destroyed deliver them, even Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the sons of Eden who were in Telassar?
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	13	'Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, and of Hena and Ivvah?'"
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	14	Then Hezekiah took the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it, and he went up to the house of the LORD and spread it out before the LORD.
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	15	Hezekiah prayed to the LORD saying,
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	16	"O LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, who is enthroned above the cherubim, You are the God, You alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth.
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	17	"Incline Your ear, O LORD, and hear; open Your eyes, O LORD, and see; and listen to all the words of Sennacherib, who sent them to reproach the living God.
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	18	"Truly, O LORD, the kings of Assyria have devastated all the countries and their lands,
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	19	and have cast their gods into the fire, for they were not gods but the work of men's hands, wood and stone. So they have destroyed them.
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	20	"Now, O LORD our God, deliver us from his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You alone, LORD, are God."
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	21	Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent word to Hezekiah, saying, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Because you have prayed to Me about Sennacherib king of Assyria,
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	22	this is the word that the LORD has spoken against him: "She has despised you and mocked you, The virgin daughter of Zion; She has shaken her head behind you, The daughter of Jerusalem!
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	23	"Whom have you reproached and blasphemed? And against whom have you raised your voice And haughtily lifted up your eyes? Against the Holy One of Israel!
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	24	"Through your servants you have reproached the Lord, And you have said, 'With my many chariots I came up to the heights of the mountains, To the remotest parts of Lebanon; And I cut down its tall cedars and its choice cypresses. And I will go to its highest peak, its thickest forest.
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	25	'I dug wells and drank waters, And with the sole of my feet I dried up All the rivers of Egypt.'
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	26	"Have you not heard? Long ago I did it, From ancient times I planned it. Now I have brought it to pass, That you should turn fortified cities into ruinous heaps.
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	27	"Therefore their inhabitants were short of strength, They were dismayed and put to shame; They were as the vegetation of the field and as the green herb, As grass on the housetops is scorched before it is grown up.
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	28	"But I know your sitting down And your going out and your coming in And your raging against Me.
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	29	"Because of your raging against Me And because your arrogance has come up to My ears, Therefore I will put My hook in your nose And My bridle in your lips, And I will turn you back by the way which you came.
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	30	"Then this shall be the sign for you: you will eat this year what grows of itself, in the second year what springs from the same, and in the third year sow, reap, plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	31	"The surviving remnant of the house of Judah will again take root downward and bear fruit upward.
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	32	"For out of Jerusalem will go forth a remnant and out of Mount Zion survivors. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this."'
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	33	"Therefore, thus says the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, 'He will not come to this city or shoot an arrow there; and he will not come before it with a shield, or throw up a siege ramp against it.
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	34	'By the way that he came, by the same he will return, and he will not come to this city,' declares the LORD.
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	35	'For I will defend this city to save it for My own sake and for My servant David's sake.'"
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	36	Then the angel of the LORD went out and struck 185,in the camp of the Assyrians; and when men arose early in the morning, behold, all of these were dead.
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	37	So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and returned home and lived at Nineveh.
Isaiah	Isa	23	37	38	It came about as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons killed him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son became king in his place.
Isaiah	Isa	23	38	1	In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him and said to him, "Thus says the LORD, 'Set your house in order, for you shall die and not live.'"
Isaiah	Isa	23	38	2	Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD,
Isaiah	Isa	23	38	3	and said, "Remember now, O LORD, I beseech You, how I have walked before You in truth and with a whole heart, and have done what is good in Your sight." And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
Isaiah	Isa	23	38	4	Then the word of the LORD came to Isaiah, saying,
Isaiah	Isa	23	38	5	"Go and say to Hezekiah, 'Thus says the LORD, the God of your father David, "I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; behold, I will add fifteen years to your life.
Isaiah	Isa	23	38	6	"I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city."'
Isaiah	Isa	23	38	7	"This shall be the sign to you from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that He has spoken:
Isaiah	Isa	23	38	8	"Behold, I will cause the shadow on the stairway, which has gone down with the sun on the stairway of Ahaz, to go back ten steps." So the sun's shadow went back ten steps on the stairway on which it had gone down.
Isaiah	Isa	23	38	9	A writing of Hezekiah king of Judah after his illness and recovery:
Isaiah	Isa	23	38	10	I said, "In the middle of my life I am to enter the gates of Sheol; I am to be deprived of the rest of my years."
Isaiah	Isa	23	38	11	I said, "I will not see the LORD, The LORD in the land of the living; I will look on man no more among the inhabitants of the world.
Isaiah	Isa	23	38	12	"Like a shepherd's tent my dwelling is pulled up and removed from me; As a weaver I rolled up my life. He cuts me off from the loom; From day until night You make an end of me.
Isaiah	Isa	23	38	13	"I composed my soul until morning. Like a lion--so He breaks all my bones, From day until night You make an end of me.
Isaiah	Isa	23	38	14	"Like a swallow, like a crane, so I twitter; I moan like a dove; My eyes look wistfully to the heights; O Lord, I am oppressed, be my security.
Isaiah	Isa	23	38	15	"What shall I say? For He has spoken to me, and He Himself has done it; I will wander about all my years because of the bitterness of my soul.
Isaiah	Isa	23	38	16	"O Lord, by these things men live, And in all these is the life of my spirit; O restore me to health and let me live!
Isaiah	Isa	23	38	17	"Lo, for my own welfare I had great bitterness; It is You who has kept my soul from the pit of nothingness, For You have cast all my sins behind Your back.
Isaiah	Isa	23	38	18	"For Sheol cannot thank You, Death cannot praise You; Those who go down to the pit cannot hope for Your faithfulness.
Isaiah	Isa	23	38	19	"It is the living who give thanks to You, as I do today; A father tells his sons about Your faithfulness.
Isaiah	Isa	23	38	20	"The LORD will surely save me; So we will play my songs on stringed instruments All the days of our life at the house of the LORD."
Isaiah	Isa	23	38	21	Now Isaiah had said, "Let them take a cake of figs and apply it to the boil, that he may recover."
Isaiah	Isa	23	38	22	Then Hezekiah had said, "What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?"
Isaiah	Isa	23	39	1	At that time Merodach-baladan son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he heard that he had been sick and had recovered.
Isaiah	Isa	23	39	2	Hezekiah was pleased, and showed them all his treasure house, the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious oil and his whole armory and all that was found in his treasuries. There was nothing in his house nor in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them.
Isaiah	Isa	23	39	3	Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and said to him, "What did these men say, and from where have they come to you?" And Hezekiah said, "They have come to me from a far country, from Babylon."
Isaiah	Isa	23	39	4	He said, "What have they seen in your house?" So Hezekiah answered, "They have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing among my treasuries that I have not shown them."
Isaiah	Isa	23	39	5	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Hear the word of the LORD of hosts,
Isaiah	Isa	23	39	6	'Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house and all that your fathers have laid up in store to this day will be carried to Babylon; nothing will be left,' says the LORD.
Isaiah	Isa	23	39	7	'And some of your sons who will issue from you, whom you will beget, will be taken away, and they will become officials in the palace of the king of Babylon.'"
Isaiah	Isa	23	39	8	Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "The word of the LORD which you have spoken is good." For he thought, "For there will be peace and truth in my days."
Isaiah	Isa	23	40	1	"Comfort, O comfort My people," says your God.
Isaiah	Isa	23	40	2	"Speak kindly to Jerusalem; And call out to her, that her warfare has ended, That her iniquity has been removed, That she has received of the LORD'S hand Double for all her sins."
Isaiah	Isa	23	40	3	A voice is calling, "Clear the way for the LORD in the wilderness; Make smooth in the desert a highway for our God.
Isaiah	Isa	23	40	4	"Let every valley be lifted up, And every mountain and hill be made low; And let the rough ground become a plain, And the rugged terrain a broad valley;
Isaiah	Isa	23	40	5	Then the glory of the LORD will be revealed, And all flesh will see it together; For the mouth of the LORD has spoken."
Isaiah	Isa	23	40	6	A voice says, "Call out." Then he answered, "What shall I call out?" All flesh is grass, and all its loveliness is like the flower of the field.
Isaiah	Isa	23	40	7	The grass withers, the flower fades, When the breath of the LORD blows upon it; Surely the people are grass.
Isaiah	Isa	23	40	8	The grass withers, the flower fades, But the word of our God stands forever.
Isaiah	Isa	23	40	9	Get yourself up on a high mountain, O Zion, bearer of good news, Lift up your voice mightily, O Jerusalem, bearer of good news; Lift it up, do not fear. Say to the cities of Judah, "Here is your God!"
Isaiah	Isa	23	40	10	Behold, the Lord GOD will come with might, With His arm ruling for Him. Behold, His reward is with Him And His recompense before Him.
Isaiah	Isa	23	40	11	Like a shepherd He will tend His flock, In His arm He will gather the lambs And carry them in His bosom; He will gently lead the nursing ewes.
Isaiah	Isa	23	40	12	Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand, And marked off the heavens by the span, And calculated the dust of the earth by the measure, And weighed the mountains in a balance And the hills in a pair of scales?
Isaiah	Isa	23	40	13	Who has directed the Spirit of the LORD, Or as His counselor has informed Him?
Isaiah	Isa	23	40	14	With whom did He consult and who gave Him understanding? And who taught Him in the path of justice and taught Him knowledge And informed Him of the way of understanding?
Isaiah	Isa	23	40	15	Behold, the nations are like a drop from a bucket, And are regarded as a speck of dust on the scales; Behold, He lifts up the islands like fine dust.
Isaiah	Isa	23	40	16	Even Lebanon is not enough to burn, Nor its beasts enough for a burnt offering.
Isaiah	Isa	23	40	17	All the nations are as nothing before Him, They are regarded by Him as less than nothing and meaningless.
Isaiah	Isa	23	40	18	To whom then will you liken God? Or what likeness will you compare with Him?
Isaiah	Isa	23	40	19	As for the idol, a craftsman casts it, A goldsmith plates it with gold, And a silversmith fashions chains of silver.
Isaiah	Isa	23	40	20	He who is too impoverished for such an offering Selects a tree that does not rot; He seeks out for himself a skillful craftsman To prepare an idol that will not totter.
Isaiah	Isa	23	40	21	Do you not know? Have you not heard? Has it not been declared to you from the beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?
Isaiah	Isa	23	40	22	It is He who sits above the circle of the earth, And its inhabitants are like grasshoppers, Who stretches out the heavens like a curtain And spreads them out like a tent to dwell in.
Isaiah	Isa	23	40	23	He it is who reduces rulers to nothing, Who makes the judges of the earth meaningless.
Isaiah	Isa	23	40	24	Scarcely have they been planted, Scarcely have they been sown, Scarcely has their stock taken root in the earth, But He merely blows on them, and they wither, And the storm carries them away like stubble.
Isaiah	Isa	23	40	25	"To whom then will you liken Me That I would be his equal?" says the Holy One.
Isaiah	Isa	23	40	26	Lift up your eyes on high And see who has created these stars, The One who leads forth their host by number, He calls them all by name; Because of the greatness of His might and the strength of His power, Not one of them is missing.
Isaiah	Isa	23	40	27	Why do you say, O Jacob, and assert, O Israel, "My way is hidden from the LORD, And the justice due me escapes the notice of my God"?
Isaiah	Isa	23	40	28	Do you not know? Have you not heard? The Everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth Does not become weary or tired. His understanding is inscrutable.
Isaiah	Isa	23	40	29	He gives strength to the weary, And to him who lacks might He increases power.
Isaiah	Isa	23	40	30	Though youths grow weary and tired, And vigorous young men stumble badly,
Isaiah	Isa	23	40	31	Yet those who wait for the LORD Will gain new strength; They will mount up with wings like eagles, They will run and not get tired, They will walk and not become weary.
Isaiah	Isa	23	41	1	"Coastlands, listen to Me in silence, And let the peoples gain new strength; Let them come forward, then let them speak; Let us come together for judgment.
Isaiah	Isa	23	41	2	"Who has aroused one from the east Whom He calls in righteousness to His feet? He delivers up nations before him And subdues kings. He makes them like dust with his sword, As the wind-driven chaff with his bow.
Isaiah	Isa	23	41	3	"He pursues them, passing on in safety, By a way he had not been traversing with his feet.
Isaiah	Isa	23	41	4	"Who has performed and accomplished it, Calling forth the generations from the beginning? 'I, the LORD, am the first, and with the last. I am He.'"
Isaiah	Isa	23	41	5	The coastlands have seen and are afraid; The ends of the earth tremble; They have drawn near and have come.
Isaiah	Isa	23	41	6	Each one helps his neighbor And says to his brother, "Be strong!"
Isaiah	Isa	23	41	7	So the craftsman encourages the smelter, And he who smooths metal with the hammer encourages him who beats the anvil, Saying of the soldering, "It is good"; And he fastens it with nails, So that it will not totter.
Isaiah	Isa	23	41	8	"But you, Israel, My servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, Descendant of Abraham My friend,
Isaiah	Isa	23	41	9	You whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, And called from its remotest parts And said to you, 'You are My servant, I have chosen you and not rejected you.
Isaiah	Isa	23	41	10	'Do not fear, for I am with you; Do not anxiously look about you, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, surely I will help you, Surely I will uphold you with My righteous right hand.'
Isaiah	Isa	23	41	11	"Behold, all those who are angered at you will be shamed and dishonored; Those who contend with you will be as nothing and will perish.
Isaiah	Isa	23	41	12	"You will seek those who quarrel with you, but will not find them, Those who war with you will be as nothing and non-existent.
Isaiah	Isa	23	41	13	"For I am the LORD your God, who upholds your right hand, Who says to you, 'Do not fear, I will help you.'
Isaiah	Isa	23	41	14	"Do not fear, you worm Jacob, you men of Israel; I will help you," declares the LORD, "and your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.
Isaiah	Isa	23	41	15	"Behold, I have made you a new, sharp threshing sledge with double edges; You will thresh the mountains and pulverize them, And will make the hills like chaff.
Isaiah	Isa	23	41	16	"You will winnow them, and the wind will carry them away, And the storm will scatter them; But you will rejoice in the LORD, You will glory in the Holy One of Israel.
Isaiah	Isa	23	41	17	"The afflicted and needy are seeking water, but there is none, And their tongue is parched with thirst; I, the LORD, will answer them Myself, As the God of Israel I will not forsake them.
Isaiah	Isa	23	41	18	"I will open rivers on the bare heights And springs in the midst of the valleys; I will make the wilderness a pool of water And the dry land fountains of water.
Isaiah	Isa	23	41	19	"I will put the cedar in the wilderness, The acacia and the myrtle and the olive tree; I will place the juniper in the desert Together with the box tree and the cypress,
Isaiah	Isa	23	41	20	That they may see and recognize, And consider and gain insight as well, That the hand of the LORD has done this, And the Holy One of Israel has created it.
Isaiah	Isa	23	41	21	"Present your case," the LORD says. "Bring forward your strong arguments," The King of Jacob says.
Isaiah	Isa	23	41	22	Let them bring forth and declare to us what is going to take place; As for the former events, declare what they were, That we may consider them and know their outcome. Or announce to us what is coming;
Isaiah	Isa	23	41	23	Declare the things that are going to come afterward, That we may know that you are gods; Indeed, do good or evil, that we may anxiously look about us and fear together.
Isaiah	Isa	23	41	24	Behold, you are of no account, And your work amounts to nothing; He who chooses you is an abomination.
Isaiah	Isa	23	41	25	"I have aroused one from the north, and he has come; From the rising of the sun he will call on My name; And he will come upon rulers as upon mortar, Even as the potter treads clay."
Isaiah	Isa	23	41	26	Who has declared this from the beginning, that we might know? Or from former times, that we may say, "He is right!"? Surely there was no one who declared, Surely there was no one who proclaimed, Surely there was no one who heard your words.
Isaiah	Isa	23	41	27	"Formerly I said to Zion, 'Behold, here they are.' And to Jerusalem, 'I will give a messenger of good news.'
Isaiah	Isa	23	41	28	"But when I look, there is no one, And there is no counselor among them Who, if I ask, can give an answer.
Isaiah	Isa	23	41	29	"Behold, all of them are false; Their works are worthless, Their molten images are wind and emptiness.
Isaiah	Isa	23	42	1	"Behold, My Servant, whom I uphold; My chosen one in whom My soul delights. I have put My Spirit upon Him; He will bring forth justice to the nations.
Isaiah	Isa	23	42	2	"He will not cry out or raise His voice, Nor make His voice heard in the street.
Isaiah	Isa	23	42	3	"A bruised reed He will not break And a dimly burning wick He will not extinguish; He will faithfully bring forth justice.
Isaiah	Isa	23	42	4	"He will not be disheartened or crushed Until He has established justice in the earth; And the coastlands will wait expectantly for His law."
Isaiah	Isa	23	42	5	Thus says God the LORD, Who created the heavens and stretched them out, Who spread out the earth and its offspring, Who gives breath to the people on it And spirit to those who walk in it,
Isaiah	Isa	23	42	6	"I am the LORD, I have called You in righteousness, I will also hold You by the hand and watch over You, And I will appoint You as a covenant to the people, As a light to the nations,
Isaiah	Isa	23	42	7	To open blind eyes, To bring out prisoners from the dungeon And those who dwell in darkness from the prison.
Isaiah	Isa	23	42	8	"I am the LORD, that is My name; I will not give My glory to another, Nor My praise to graven images.
Isaiah	Isa	23	42	9	"Behold, the former things have come to pass, Now I declare new things; Before they spring forth I proclaim them to you."
Isaiah	Isa	23	42	10	Sing to the LORD a new song, Sing His praise from the end of the earth! You who go down to the sea, and all that is in it. You islands, and those who dwell on them.
Isaiah	Isa	23	42	11	Let the wilderness and its cities lift up their voices, The settlements where Kedar inhabits. Let the inhabitants of Sela sing aloud, Let them shout for joy from the tops of the mountains.
Isaiah	Isa	23	42	12	Let them give glory to the LORD And declare His praise in the coastlands.
Isaiah	Isa	23	42	13	The LORD will go forth like a warrior, He will arouse His zeal like a man of war. He will utter a shout, yes, He will raise a war cry. He will prevail against His enemies.
Isaiah	Isa	23	42	14	"I have kept silent for a long time, I have kept still and restrained Myself. Now like a woman in labor I will groan, I will both gasp and pant.
Isaiah	Isa	23	42	15	"I will lay waste the mountains and hills And wither all their vegetation; I will make the rivers into coastlands And dry up the ponds.
Isaiah	Isa	23	42	16	"I will lead the blind by a way they do not know, In paths they do not know I will guide them. I will make darkness into light before them And rugged places into plains. These are the things I will do, And I will not leave them undone."
Isaiah	Isa	23	42	17	They will be turned back and be utterly put to shame, Who trust in idols, Who say to molten images, "You are our gods."
Isaiah	Isa	23	42	18	Hear, you deaf! And look, you blind, that you may see.
Isaiah	Isa	23	42	19	Who is blind but My servant, Or so deaf as My messenger whom I send? Who is so blind as he that is at peace with Me, Or so blind as the servant of the LORD?
Isaiah	Isa	23	42	20	You have seen many things, but you do not observe them; Your ears are open, but none hears.
Isaiah	Isa	23	42	21	The LORD was pleased for His righteousness' sake To make the law great and glorious.
Isaiah	Isa	23	42	22	But this is a people plundered and despoiled; All of them are trapped in caves, Or are hidden away in prisons; They have become a prey with none to deliver them, And a spoil, with none to say, "Give them back!"
Isaiah	Isa	23	42	23	Who among you will give ear to this? Who will give heed and listen hereafter?
Isaiah	Isa	23	42	24	Who gave Jacob up for spoil, and Israel to plunderers? Was it not the LORD, against whom we have sinned, And in whose ways they were not willing to walk, And whose law they did not obey?
Isaiah	Isa	23	42	25	So He poured out on him the heat of His anger And the fierceness of battle; And it set him aflame all around, Yet he did not recognize it; And it burned him, but he paid no attention.
Isaiah	Isa	23	43	1	But now, thus says the LORD, your Creator, O Jacob, And He who formed you, O Israel, "Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name; you are Mine!
Isaiah	Isa	23	43	2	"When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; And through the rivers, they will not overflow you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be scorched, Nor will the flame burn you.
Isaiah	Isa	23	43	3	"For I am the LORD your God, The Holy One of Israel, your Savior; I have given Egypt as your ransom, Cush and Seba in your place.
Isaiah	Isa	23	43	4	"Since you are precious in My sight, Since you are honored and I love you, I will give other men in your place and other peoples in exchange for your life.
Isaiah	Isa	23	43	5	"Do not fear, for I am with you; I will bring your offspring from the east, And gather you from the west.
Isaiah	Isa	23	43	6	"I will say to the north, 'Give them up!' And to the south, 'Do not hold them back.' Bring My sons from afar And My daughters from the ends of the earth,
Isaiah	Isa	23	43	7	Everyone who is called by My name, And whom I have created for My glory, Whom I have formed, even whom I have made."
Isaiah	Isa	23	43	8	Bring out the people who are blind, even though they have eyes, And the deaf, even though they have ears.
Isaiah	Isa	23	43	9	All the nations have gathered together So that the peoples may be assembled. Who among them can declare this And proclaim to us the former things? Let them present their witnesses that they may be justified, Or let them hear and say, "It is true."
Isaiah	Isa	23	43	10	"You are My witnesses," declares the LORD, "And My servant whom I have chosen, So that you may know and believe Me And understand that I am He. Before Me there was no God formed, And there will be none after Me.
Isaiah	Isa	23	43	11	"I, even I, am the LORD, And there is no savior besides Me.
Isaiah	Isa	23	43	12	"It is I who have declared and saved and proclaimed, And there was no strange god among you; So you are My witnesses," declares the LORD, "And I am God.
Isaiah	Isa	23	43	13	"Even from eternity I am He, And there is none who can deliver out of My hand; I act and who can reverse it?"
Isaiah	Isa	23	43	14	Thus says the LORD your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, "For your sake I have sent to Babylon, And will bring them all down as fugitives, Even the Chaldeans, into the ships in which they rejoice.
Isaiah	Isa	23	43	15	"I am the LORD, your Holy One, The Creator of Israel, your King."
Isaiah	Isa	23	43	16	Thus says the LORD, Who makes a way through the sea And a path through the mighty waters,
Isaiah	Isa	23	43	17	Who brings forth the chariot and the horse, The army and the mighty man (They will lie down together and not rise again; They have been quenched and extinguished like a wick):
Isaiah	Isa	23	43	18	"Do not call to mind the former things, Or ponder things of the past.
Isaiah	Isa	23	43	19	"Behold, I will do something new, Now it will spring forth; Will you not be aware of it? I will even make a roadway in the wilderness, Rivers in the desert.
Isaiah	Isa	23	43	20	"The beasts of the field will glorify Me, The jackals and the ostriches, Because I have given waters in the wilderness And rivers in the desert, To give drink to My chosen people.
Isaiah	Isa	23	43	21	"The people whom I formed for Myself Will declare My praise.
Isaiah	Isa	23	43	22	"Yet you have not called on Me, O Jacob; But you have become weary of Me, O Israel.
Isaiah	Isa	23	43	23	"You have not brought to Me the sheep of your burnt offerings, Nor have you honored Me with your sacrifices. I have not burdened you with offerings, Nor wearied you with incense.
Isaiah	Isa	23	43	24	"You have bought Me not sweet cane with money, Nor have you filled Me with the fat of your sacrifices; Rather you have burdened Me with your sins, You have wearied Me with your iniquities.
Isaiah	Isa	23	43	25	"I, even I, am the one who wipes out your transgressions for My own sake, And I will not remember your sins.
Isaiah	Isa	23	43	26	"Put Me in remembrance, let us argue our case together; State your cause, that you may be proved right.
Isaiah	Isa	23	43	27	"Your first forefather sinned, And your spokesmen have transgressed against Me.
Isaiah	Isa	23	43	28	"So I will pollute the princes of the sanctuary, And I will consign Jacob to the ban and Israel to revilement.
Isaiah	Isa	23	44	1	"But now listen, O Jacob, My servant, And Israel, whom I have chosen:
Isaiah	Isa	23	44	2	Thus says the LORD who made you And formed you from the womb, who will help you, 'Do not fear, O Jacob My servant; And you Jeshurun whom I have chosen.
Isaiah	Isa	23	44	3	'For I will pour out water on the thirsty land And streams on the dry ground; I will pour out My Spirit on your offspring And My blessing on your descendants;
Isaiah	Isa	23	44	4	And they will spring up among the grass Like poplars by streams of water.'
Isaiah	Isa	23	44	5	"This one will say, 'I am the LORD'S'; And that one will call on the name of Jacob; And another will write on his hand, 'Belonging to the LORD,' And will name Israel's name with honor.
Isaiah	Isa	23	44	6	"Thus says the LORD, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts: 'I am the first and I am the last, And there is no God besides Me.
Isaiah	Isa	23	44	7	'Who is like Me? Let him proclaim and declare it; Yes, let him recount it to Me in order, From the time that I established the ancient nation. And let them declare to them the things that are coming And the events that are going to take place.
Isaiah	Isa	23	44	8	'Do not tremble and do not be afraid; Have I not long since announced it to you and declared it? And you are My witnesses. Is there any God besides Me, Or is there any other Rock? I know of none.'"
Isaiah	Isa	23	44	9	Those who fashion a graven image are all of them futile, and their precious things are of no profit; even their own witnesses fail to see or know, so that they will be put to shame.
Isaiah	Isa	23	44	10	Who has fashioned a god or cast an idol to no profit?
Isaiah	Isa	23	44	11	Behold, all his companions will be put to shame, for the craftsmen themselves are mere men. Let them all assemble themselves, let them stand up, let them tremble, let them together be put to shame.
Isaiah	Isa	23	44	12	The man shapes iron into a cutting tool and does his work over the coals, fashioning it with hammers and working it with his strong arm. He also gets hungry and his strength fails; he drinks no water and becomes weary.
Isaiah	Isa	23	44	13	Another shapes wood, he extends a measuring line; he outlines it with red chalk. He works it with planes and outlines it with a compass, and makes it like the form of a man, like the beauty of man, so that it may sit in a house.
Isaiah	Isa	23	44	14	Surely he cuts cedars for himself, and takes a cypress or an oak and raises it for himself among the trees of the forest. He plants a fir, and the rain makes it grow.
Isaiah	Isa	23	44	15	Then it becomes something for a man to burn, so he takes one of them and warms himself; he also makes a fire to bake bread. He also makes a god and worships it; he makes it a graven image and falls down before it.
Isaiah	Isa	23	44	16	Half of it he burns in the fire; over this half he eats meat as he roasts a roast and is satisfied. He also warms himself and says, "Aha! I am warm, I have seen the fire."
Isaiah	Isa	23	44	17	But the rest of it he makes into a god, his graven image. He falls down before it and worships; he also prays to it and says, "Deliver me, for you are my god."
Isaiah	Isa	23	44	18	They do not know, nor do they understand, for He has smeared over their eyes so that they cannot see and their hearts so that they cannot comprehend.
Isaiah	Isa	23	44	19	No one recalls, nor is there knowledge or understanding to say, "I have burned half of it in the fire and also have baked bread over its coals. I roast meat and eat it. Then I make the rest of it into an abomination, I fall down before a block of wood!"
Isaiah	Isa	23	44	20	He feeds on ashes; a deceived heart has turned him aside. And he cannot deliver himself, nor say, "Is there not a lie in my right hand?"
Isaiah	Isa	23	44	21	"Remember these things, O Jacob, And Israel, for you are My servant; I have formed you, you are My servant, O Israel, you will not be forgotten by Me.
Isaiah	Isa	23	44	22	"I have wiped out your transgressions like a thick cloud And your sins like a heavy mist. Return to Me, for I have redeemed you."
Isaiah	Isa	23	44	23	Shout for joy, O heavens, for the LORD has done it! Shout joyfully, you lower parts of the earth; Break forth into a shout of joy, you mountains, O forest, and every tree in it; For the LORD has redeemed Jacob And in Israel He shows forth His glory.
Isaiah	Isa	23	44	24	Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer, and the one who formed you from the womb, "I, the LORD, am the maker of all things, Stretching out the heavens by Myself And spreading out the earth all alone,
Isaiah	Isa	23	44	25	Causing the omens of boasters to fail, Making fools out of diviners, Causing wise men to draw back And turning their knowledge into foolishness,
Isaiah	Isa	23	44	26	Confirming the word of His servant And performing the purpose of His messengers. It is I who says of Jerusalem, 'She shall be inhabited!' And of the cities of Judah, 'They shall be built.' And I will raise up her ruins again.
Isaiah	Isa	23	44	27	"It is I who says to the depth of the sea, 'Be dried up!' And I will make your rivers dry.
Isaiah	Isa	23	44	28	"It is I who says of Cyrus, 'He is My shepherd! And he will perform all My desire.' And he declares of Jerusalem, 'She will be built,' And of the temple, 'Your foundation will be laid.'"
Isaiah	Isa	23	45	1	Thus says the LORD to Cyrus His anointed, Whom I have taken by the right hand, To subdue nations before him And to loose the loins of kings; To open doors before him so that gates will not be shut:
Isaiah	Isa	23	45	2	"I will go before you and make the rough places smooth; I will shatter the doors of bronze and cut through their iron bars.
Isaiah	Isa	23	45	3	"I will give you the treasures of darkness And hidden wealth of secret places, So that you may know that it is I, The LORD, the God of Israel, who calls you by your name.
Isaiah	Isa	23	45	4	"For the sake of Jacob My servant, And Israel My chosen one, I have also called you by your name; I have given you a title of honor Though you have not known Me.
Isaiah	Isa	23	45	5	"I am the LORD, and there is no other; Besides Me there is no God. I will gird you, though you have not known Me;
Isaiah	Isa	23	45	6	That men may know from the rising to the setting of the sun That there is no one besides Me. I am the LORD, and there is no other,
Isaiah	Isa	23	45	7	The One forming light and creating darkness, Causing well-being and creating calamity; I am the LORD who does all these.
Isaiah	Isa	23	45	8	"Drip down, O heavens, from above, And let the clouds pour down righteousness; Let the earth open up and salvation bear fruit, And righteousness spring up with it. I, the LORD, have created it.
Isaiah	Isa	23	45	9	"Woe to the one who quarrels with his Maker-- An earthenware vessel among the vessels of earth! Will the clay say to the potter, 'What are you doing?' Or the thing you are making say, 'He has no hands'?
Isaiah	Isa	23	45	10	"Woe to him who says to a father, 'What are you begetting?' Or to a woman, 'To what are you giving birth?'"
Isaiah	Isa	23	45	11	Thus says the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker: "Ask Me about the things to come concerning My sons, And you shall commit to Me the work of My hands.
Isaiah	Isa	23	45	12	"It is I who made the earth, and created man upon it. I stretched out the heavens with My hands And I ordained all their host.
Isaiah	Isa	23	45	13	"I have aroused him in righteousness And I will make all his ways smooth; He will build My city and will let My exiles go free, Without any payment or reward," says the LORD of hosts.
Isaiah	Isa	23	45	14	Thus says the LORD, "The products of Egypt and the merchandise of Cush And the Sabeans, men of stature, Will come over to you and will be yours; They will walk behind you, they will come over in chains And will bow down to you; They will make supplication to you: 'Surely, God is with you, and there is none else, No other God.'"
Isaiah	Isa	23	45	15	Truly, You are a God who hides Himself, O God of Israel, Savior!
Isaiah	Isa	23	45	16	They will be put to shame and even humiliated, all of them; The manufacturers of idols will go away together in humiliation.
Isaiah	Isa	23	45	17	Israel has been saved by the LORD With an everlasting salvation; You will not be put to shame or humiliated To all eternity.
Isaiah	Isa	23	45	18	For thus says the LORD, who created the heavens (He is the God who formed the earth and made it, He established it and did not create it a waste place, but formed it to be inhabited), "I am the LORD, and there is none else.
Isaiah	Isa	23	45	19	"I have not spoken in secret, In some dark land; I did not say to the offspring of Jacob, 'Seek Me in a waste place'; I, the LORD, speak righteousness, Declaring things that are upright.
Isaiah	Isa	23	45	20	"Gather yourselves and come; Draw near together, you fugitives of the nations; They have no knowledge, Who carry about their wooden idol And pray to a god who cannot save.
Isaiah	Isa	23	45	21	"Declare and set forth your case; Indeed, let them consult together. Who has announced this from of old? Who has long since declared it? Is it not I, the LORD? And there is no other God besides Me, A righteous God and a Savior; There is none except Me.
Isaiah	Isa	23	45	22	"Turn to Me and be saved, all the ends of the earth; For I am God, and there is no other.
Isaiah	Isa	23	45	23	"I have sworn by Myself, The word has gone forth from My mouth in righteousness And will not turn back, That to Me every knee will bow, every tongue will swear allegiance.
Isaiah	Isa	23	45	24	"They will say of Me, 'Only in the LORD are righteousness and strength.' Men will come to Him, And all who were angry at Him will be put to shame.
Isaiah	Isa	23	45	25	"In the LORD all the offspring of Israel Will be justified and will glory."
Isaiah	Isa	23	46	1	Bel has bowed down, Nebo stoops over; Their images are consigned to the beasts and the cattle. The things that you carry are burdensome, A load for the weary beast.
Isaiah	Isa	23	46	2	They stooped over, they have bowed down together; They could not rescue the burden, But have themselves gone into captivity.
Isaiah	Isa	23	46	3	"Listen to Me, O house of Jacob, And all the remnant of the house of Israel, You who have been borne by Me from birth And have been carried from the womb;
Isaiah	Isa	23	46	4	Even to your old age I will be the same, And even to your graying years I will bear you! I have done it, and I will carry you; And I will bear you and I will deliver you.
Isaiah	Isa	23	46	5	"To whom would you liken Me And make Me equal and compare Me, That we would be alike?
Isaiah	Isa	23	46	6	"Those who lavish gold from the purse And weigh silver on the scale Hire a goldsmith, and he makes it into a god; They bow down, indeed they worship it.
Isaiah	Isa	23	46	7	"They lift it upon the shoulder and carry it; They set it in its place and it stands there. It does not move from its place. Though one may cry to it, it cannot answer; It cannot deliver him from his distress.
Isaiah	Isa	23	46	8	"Remember this, and be assured; Recall it to mind, you transgressors.
Isaiah	Isa	23	46	9	"Remember the former things long past, For I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is no one like Me,
Isaiah	Isa	23	46	10	Declaring the end from the beginning, And from ancient times things which have not been done, Saying, 'My purpose will be established, And I will accomplish all My good pleasure';
Isaiah	Isa	23	46	11	Calling a bird of prey from the east, The man of My purpose from a far country. Truly I have spoken; truly I will bring it to pass. I have planned it, surely I will do it.
Isaiah	Isa	23	46	12	"Listen to Me, you stubborn-minded, Who are far from righteousness.
Isaiah	Isa	23	46	13	"I bring near My righteousness, it is not far off; And My salvation will not delay. And I will grant salvation in Zion, And My glory for Israel.
Isaiah	Isa	23	47	1	"Come down and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon; Sit on the ground without a throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans! For you shall no longer be called tender and delicate.
Isaiah	Isa	23	47	2	"Take the millstones and grind meal. Remove your veil, strip off the skirt, Uncover the leg, cross the rivers.
Isaiah	Isa	23	47	3	"Your nakedness will be uncovered, Your shame also will be exposed; I will take vengeance and will not spare a man."
Isaiah	Isa	23	47	4	Our Redeemer, the LORD of hosts is His name, The Holy One of Israel.
Isaiah	Isa	23	47	5	"Sit silently, and go into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans, For you will no longer be called The queen of kingdoms.
Isaiah	Isa	23	47	6	"I was angry with My people, I profaned My heritage And gave them into your hand. You did not show mercy to them, On the aged you made your yoke very heavy.
Isaiah	Isa	23	47	7	"Yet you said, 'I will be a queen forever.' These things you did not consider Nor remember the outcome of them.
Isaiah	Isa	23	47	8	"Now, then, hear this, you sensual one, Who dwells securely, Who says in your heart, 'I am, and there is no one besides me. I will not sit as a widow, Nor know loss of children.'
Isaiah	Isa	23	47	9	"But these two things will come on you suddenly in one day: Loss of children and widowhood. They will come on you in full measure In spite of your many sorceries, In spite of the great power of your spells.
Isaiah	Isa	23	47	10	"You felt secure in your wickedness and said, 'No one sees me,' Your wisdom and your knowledge, they have deluded you; For you have said in your heart, 'I am, and there is no one besides me.'
Isaiah	Isa	23	47	11	"But evil will come on you Which you will not know how to charm away; And disaster will fall on you For which you cannot atone; And destruction about which you do not know Will come on you suddenly.
Isaiah	Isa	23	47	12	"Stand fast now in your spells And in your many sorceries With which you have labored from your youth; Perhaps you will be able to profit, Perhaps you may cause trembling.
Isaiah	Isa	23	47	13	"You are wearied with your many counsels; Let now the astrologers, Those who prophesy by the stars, Those who predict by the new moons, Stand up and save you from what will come upon you.
Isaiah	Isa	23	47	14	"Behold, they have become like stubble, Fire burns them; They cannot deliver themselves from the power of the flame; There will be no coal to warm by Nor a fire to sit before!
Isaiah	Isa	23	47	15	"So have those become to you with whom you have labored, Who have trafficked with you from your youth; Each has wandered in his own way; There is none to save you.
Isaiah	Isa	23	48	1	"Hear this, O house of Jacob, who are named Israel And who came forth from the loins of Judah, Who swear by the name of the LORD And invoke the God of Israel, But not in truth nor in righteousness.
Isaiah	Isa	23	48	2	"For they call themselves after the holy city And lean on the God of Israel; The LORD of hosts is His name.
Isaiah	Isa	23	48	3	"I declared the former things long ago And they went forth from My mouth, and I proclaimed them. Suddenly I acted, and they came to pass.
Isaiah	Isa	23	48	4	"Because I know that you are obstinate, And your neck is an iron sinew And your forehead bronze,
Isaiah	Isa	23	48	5	Therefore I declared them to you long ago, Before they took place I proclaimed them to you, So that you would not say, 'My idol has done them, And my graven image and my molten image have commanded them.'
Isaiah	Isa	23	48	6	"You have heard; look at all this. And you, will you not declare it? I proclaim to you new things from this time, Even hidden things which you have not known.
Isaiah	Isa	23	48	7	"They are created now and not long ago; And before today you have not heard them, So that you will not say, 'Behold, I knew them.'
Isaiah	Isa	23	48	8	"You have not heard, you have not known. Even from long ago your ear has not been open, Because I knew that you would deal very treacherously; And you have been called a rebel from birth.
Isaiah	Isa	23	48	9	"For the sake of My name I delay My wrath, And for My praise I restrain it for you, In order not to cut you off.
Isaiah	Isa	23	48	10	"Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have tested you in the furnace of affliction.
Isaiah	Isa	23	48	11	"For My own sake, for My own sake, I will act; For how can My name be profaned? And My glory I will not give to another.
Isaiah	Isa	23	48	12	"Listen to Me, O Jacob, even Israel whom I called; I am He, I am the first, I am also the last.
Isaiah	Isa	23	48	13	"Surely My hand founded the earth, And My right hand spread out the heavens; When I call to them, they stand together.
Isaiah	Isa	23	48	14	"Assemble, all of you, and listen! Who among them has declared these things? The LORD loves him; he will carry out His good pleasure on Babylon, And His arm will be against the Chaldeans.
Isaiah	Isa	23	48	15	"I, even I, have spoken; indeed I have called him, I have brought him, and He will make his ways successful.
Isaiah	Isa	23	48	16	"Come near to Me, listen to this: From the first I have not spoken in secret, From the time it took place, I was there. And now the Lord GOD has sent Me, and His Spirit."
Isaiah	Isa	23	48	17	Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, "I am the LORD your God, who teaches you to profit, Who leads you in the way you should go.
Isaiah	Isa	23	48	18	"If only you had paid attention to My commandments! Then your well-being would have been like a river, And your righteousness like the waves of the sea.
Isaiah	Isa	23	48	19	"Your descendants would have been like the sand, And your offspring like its grains; Their name would never be cut off or destroyed from My presence."
Isaiah	Isa	23	48	20	Go forth from Babylon! Flee from the Chaldeans! Declare with the sound of joyful shouting, proclaim this, Send it out to the end of the earth; Say, "The LORD has redeemed His servant Jacob."
Isaiah	Isa	23	48	21	They did not thirst when He led them through the deserts. He made the water flow out of the rock for them; He split the rock and the water gushed forth.
Isaiah	Isa	23	48	22	"There is no peace for the wicked," says the LORD.
Isaiah	Isa	23	49	1	Listen to Me, O islands, And pay attention, you peoples from afar. The LORD called Me from the womb; From the body of My mother He named Me.
Isaiah	Isa	23	49	2	He has made My mouth like a sharp sword, In the shadow of His hand He has concealed Me; And He has also made Me a select arrow, He has hidden Me in His quiver.
Isaiah	Isa	23	49	3	He said to Me, "You are My Servant, Israel, In Whom I will show My glory."
Isaiah	Isa	23	49	4	But I said, "I have toiled in vain, I have spent My strength for nothing and vanity; Yet surely the justice due to Me is with the LORD, And My reward with My God."
Isaiah	Isa	23	49	5	And now says the LORD, who formed Me from the womb to be His Servant, To bring Jacob back to Him, so that Israel might be gathered to Him (For I am honored in the sight of the LORD, And My God is My strength),
Isaiah	Isa	23	49	6	He says, "It is too small a thing that You should be My Servant To raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the preserved ones of Israel; I will also make You a light of the nations So that My salvation may reach to the end of the earth."
Isaiah	Isa	23	49	7	Thus says the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel and its Holy One, To the despised One, To the One abhorred by the nation, To the Servant of rulers, "Kings will see and arise, Princes will also bow down, Because of the LORD who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel who has chosen You."
Isaiah	Isa	23	49	8	Thus says the LORD, "In a favorable time I have answered You, And in a day of salvation I have helped You; And I will keep You and give You for a covenant of the people, To restore the land, to make them inherit the desolate heritages;
Isaiah	Isa	23	49	9	Saying to those who are bound, 'Go forth,' To those who are in darkness, 'Show yourselves.' Along the roads they will feed, And their pasture will be on all bare heights.
Isaiah	Isa	23	49	10	"They will not hunger or thirst, Nor will the scorching heat or sun strike them down; For He who has compassion on them will lead them And will guide them to springs of water.
Isaiah	Isa	23	49	11	"I will make all My mountains a road, And My highways will be raised up.
Isaiah	Isa	23	49	12	"Behold, these will come from afar; And lo, these will come from the north and from the west, And these from the land of Sinim."
Isaiah	Isa	23	49	13	Shout for joy, O heavens! And rejoice, O earth! Break forth into joyful shouting, O mountains! For the LORD has comforted His people And will have compassion on His afflicted.
Isaiah	Isa	23	49	14	But Zion said, "The LORD has forsaken me, And the Lord has forgotten me."
Isaiah	Isa	23	49	15	"Can a woman forget her nursing child And have no compassion on the son of her womb? Even these may forget, but I will not forget you.
Isaiah	Isa	23	49	16	"Behold, I have inscribed you on the palms of My hands; Your walls are continually before Me.
Isaiah	Isa	23	49	17	"Your builders hurry; Your destroyers and devastators Will depart from you.
Isaiah	Isa	23	49	18	"Lift up your eyes and look around; All of them gather together, they come to you. As I live," declares the LORD, "You will surely put on all of them as jewels and bind them on as a bride.
Isaiah	Isa	23	49	19	"For your waste and desolate places and your destroyed land-- Surely now you will be too cramped for the inhabitants, And those who swallowed you will be far away.
Isaiah	Isa	23	49	20	"The children of whom you were bereaved will yet say in your ears, 'The place is too cramped for me; Make room for me that I may live here.'
Isaiah	Isa	23	49	21	"Then you will say in your heart, 'Who has begotten these for me, Since I have been bereaved of my children And am barren, an exile and a wanderer? And who has reared these? Behold, I was left alone; From where did these come?'"
Isaiah	Isa	23	49	22	Thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I will lift up My hand to the nations And set up My standard to the peoples; And they will bring your sons in their bosom, And your daughters will be carried on their shoulders.
Isaiah	Isa	23	49	23	"Kings will be your guardians, And their princesses your nurses. They will bow down to you with their faces to the earth And lick the dust of your feet; And you will know that I am the LORD; Those who hopefully wait for Me will not be put to shame.
Isaiah	Isa	23	49	24	"Can the prey be taken from the mighty man, Or the captives of a tyrant be rescued?"
Isaiah	Isa	23	49	25	Surely, thus says the LORD, "Even the captives of the mighty man will be taken away, And the prey of the tyrant will be rescued; For I will contend with the one who contends with you, And I will save your sons.
Isaiah	Isa	23	49	26	"I will feed your oppressors with their own flesh, And they will become drunk with their own blood as with sweet wine; And all flesh will know that I, the LORD, am your Savior And your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob."
Isaiah	Isa	23	50	1	Thus says the LORD, "Where is the certificate of divorce By which I have sent your mother away? Or to whom of My creditors did I sell you? Behold, you were sold for your iniquities, And for your transgressions your mother was sent away.
Isaiah	Isa	23	50	2	"Why was there no man when I came? When I called, why was there none to answer? Is My hand so short that it cannot ransom? Or have I no power to deliver? Behold, I dry up the sea with My rebuke, I make the rivers a wilderness; Their fish stink for lack of water And die of thirst.
Isaiah	Isa	23	50	3	"I clothe the heavens with blackness And make sackcloth their covering."
Isaiah	Isa	23	50	4	The Lord GOD has given Me the tongue of disciples, That I may know how to sustain the weary one with a word. He awakens Me morning by morning, He awakens My ear to listen as a disciple.
Isaiah	Isa	23	50	5	The Lord GOD has opened My ear; And I was not disobedient Nor did I turn back.
Isaiah	Isa	23	50	6	I gave My back to those who strike Me, And My cheeks to those who pluck out the beard; I did not cover My face from humiliation and spitting.
Isaiah	Isa	23	50	7	For the Lord GOD helps Me, Therefore, I am not disgraced; Therefore, I have set My face like flint, And I know that I will not be ashamed.
Isaiah	Isa	23	50	8	He who vindicates Me is near; Who will contend with Me? Let us stand up to each other; Who has a case against Me? Let him draw near to Me.
Isaiah	Isa	23	50	9	Behold, the Lord GOD helps Me; Who is he who condemns Me? Behold, they will all wear out like a garment; The moth will eat them.
Isaiah	Isa	23	50	10	Who is among you that fears the LORD, That obeys the voice of His servant, That walks in darkness and has no light? Let him trust in the name of the LORD and rely on his God.
Isaiah	Isa	23	50	11	Behold, all you who kindle a fire, Who encircle yourselves with firebrands, Walk in the light of your fire And among the brands you have set ablaze. This you will have from My hand: You will lie down in torment.
Isaiah	Isa	23	51	1	"Listen to me, you who pursue righteousness, Who seek the LORD: Look to the rock from which you were hewn And to the quarry from which you were dug.
Isaiah	Isa	23	51	2	"Look to Abraham your father And to Sarah who gave birth to you in pain; When he was but one I called him, Then I blessed him and multiplied him."
Isaiah	Isa	23	51	3	Indeed, the LORD will comfort Zion; He will comfort all her waste places. And her wilderness He will make like Eden, And her desert like the garden of the LORD; Joy and gladness will be found in her, Thanksgiving and sound of a melody.
Isaiah	Isa	23	51	4	"Pay attention to Me, O My people, And give ear to Me, O My nation; For a law will go forth from Me, And I will set My justice for a light of the peoples.
Isaiah	Isa	23	51	5	"My righteousness is near, My salvation has gone forth, And My arms will judge the peoples; The coastlands will wait for Me, And for My arm they will wait expectantly.
Isaiah	Isa	23	51	6	"Lift up your eyes to the sky, Then look to the earth beneath; For the sky will vanish like smoke, And the earth will wear out like a garment And its inhabitants will die in like manner; But My salvation will be forever, And My righteousness will not wane.
Isaiah	Isa	23	51	7	"Listen to Me, you who know righteousness, A people in whose heart is My law; Do not fear the reproach of man, Nor be dismayed at their revilings.
Isaiah	Isa	23	51	8	"For the moth will eat them like a garment, And the grub will eat them like wool. But My righteousness will be forever, And My salvation to all generations."
Isaiah	Isa	23	51	9	Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; Awake as in the days of old, the generations of long ago. Was it not You who cut Rahab in pieces, Who pierced the dragon?
Isaiah	Isa	23	51	10	Was it not You who dried up the sea, The waters of the great deep; Who made the depths of the sea a pathway For the redeemed to cross over?
Isaiah	Isa	23	51	11	So the ransomed of the LORD will return And come with joyful shouting to Zion, And everlasting joy will be on their heads. They will obtain gladness and joy, And sorrow and sighing will flee away.
Isaiah	Isa	23	51	12	"I, even I, am He who comforts you. Who are you that you are afraid of man who dies And of the son of man who is made like grass,
Isaiah	Isa	23	51	13	That you have forgotten the LORD your Maker, Who stretched out the heavens And laid the foundations of the earth, That you fear continually all day long because of the fury of the oppressor, As he makes ready to destroy? But where is the fury of the oppressor?
Isaiah	Isa	23	51	14	"The exile will soon be set free, and will not die in the dungeon, nor will his bread be lacking.
Isaiah	Isa	23	51	15	"For I am the LORD your God, who stirs up the sea and its waves roar (the LORD of hosts is His name).
Isaiah	Isa	23	51	16	"I have put My words in your mouth and have covered you with the shadow of My hand, to establish the heavens, to found the earth, and to say to Zion, 'You are My people.'"
Isaiah	Isa	23	51	17	Rouse yourself! Rouse yourself! Arise, O Jerusalem, You who have drunk from the LORD'S hand the cup of His anger; The chalice of reeling you have drained to the dregs.
Isaiah	Isa	23	51	18	There is none to guide her among all the sons she has borne, Nor is there one to take her by the hand among all the sons she has reared.
Isaiah	Isa	23	51	19	These two things have befallen you; Who will mourn for you? The devastation and destruction, famine and sword; How shall I comfort you?
Isaiah	Isa	23	51	20	Your sons have fainted, They lie helpless at the head of every street, Like an antelope in a net, Full of the wrath of the LORD, The rebuke of your God.
Isaiah	Isa	23	51	21	Therefore, please hear this, you afflicted, Who are drunk, but not with wine:
Isaiah	Isa	23	51	22	Thus says your Lord, the LORD, even your God Who contends for His people, "Behold, I have taken out of your hand the cup of reeling, The chalice of My anger; You will never drink it again.
Isaiah	Isa	23	51	23	"I will put it into the hand of your tormentors, Who have said to you, 'Lie down that we may walk over you.' You have even made your back like the ground And like the street for those who walk over it."
Isaiah	Isa	23	52	1	Awake, awake, Clothe yourself in your strength, O Zion; Clothe yourself in your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city; For the uncircumcised and the unclean Will no longer come into you.
Isaiah	Isa	23	52	2	Shake yourself from the dust, rise up, O captive Jerusalem; Loose yourself from the chains around your neck, O captive daughter of Zion.
Isaiah	Isa	23	52	3	For thus says the LORD, "You were sold for nothing and you will be redeemed without money."
Isaiah	Isa	23	52	4	For thus says the Lord GOD, "My people went down at the first into Egypt to reside there; then the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.
Isaiah	Isa	23	52	5	"Now therefore, what do I have here," declares the LORD, "seeing that My people have been taken away without cause?" Again the LORD declares, "Those who rule over them howl, and My name is continually blasphemed all day long.
Isaiah	Isa	23	52	6	"Therefore My people shall know My name; therefore in that day I am the one who is speaking, 'Here I am.'"
Isaiah	Isa	23	52	7	How lovely on the mountains Are the feet of him who brings good news, Who announces peace And brings good news of happiness, Who announces salvation, And says to Zion, "Your God reigns!"
Isaiah	Isa	23	52	8	Listen! Your watchmen lift up their voices, They shout joyfully together; For they will see with their own eyes When the LORD restores Zion.
Isaiah	Isa	23	52	9	Break forth, shout joyfully together, You waste places of Jerusalem; For the LORD has comforted His people, He has redeemed Jerusalem.
Isaiah	Isa	23	52	10	The LORD has bared His holy arm In the sight of all the nations, That all the ends of the earth may see The salvation of our God.
Isaiah	Isa	23	52	11	Depart, depart, go out from there, Touch nothing unclean; Go out of the midst of her, purify yourselves, You who carry the vessels of the LORD.
Isaiah	Isa	23	52	12	But you will not go out in haste, Nor will you go as fugitives; For the LORD will go before you, And the God of Israel will be your rear guard.
Isaiah	Isa	23	52	13	Behold, My servant will prosper, He will be high and lifted up and greatly exalted.
Isaiah	Isa	23	52	14	Just as many were astonished at you, My people, So His appearance was marred more than any man And His form more than the sons of men.
Isaiah	Isa	23	52	15	Thus He will sprinkle many nations, Kings will shut their mouths on account of Him; For what had not been told them they will see, And what they had not heard they will understand.
Isaiah	Isa	23	53	1	Who has believed our message? And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?
Isaiah	Isa	23	53	2	For He grew up before Him like a tender shoot, And like a root out of parched ground; He has no stately form or majesty That we should look upon Him, Nor appearance that we should be attracted to Him.
Isaiah	Isa	23	53	3	He was despised and forsaken of men, A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; And like one from whom men hide their face He was despised, and we did not esteem Him.
Isaiah	Isa	23	53	4	Surely our griefs He Himself bore, And our sorrows He carried; Yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken, Smitten of God, and afflicted.
Isaiah	Isa	23	53	5	But He was pierced through for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities; The chastening for our well-being fell upon Him, And by His scourging we are healed.
Isaiah	Isa	23	53	6	All of us like sheep have gone astray, Each of us has turned to his own way; But the LORD has caused the iniquity of us all To fall on Him.
Isaiah	Isa	23	53	7	He was oppressed and He was afflicted, Yet He did not open His mouth; Like a lamb that is led to slaughter, And like a sheep that is silent before its shearers, So He did not open His mouth.
Isaiah	Isa	23	53	8	By oppression and judgment He was taken away; And as for His generation, who considered That He was cut off out of the land of the living For the transgression of my people, to whom the stroke was due?
Isaiah	Isa	23	53	9	His grave was assigned with wicked men, Yet He was with a rich man in His death, Because He had done no violence, Nor was there any deceit in His mouth.
Isaiah	Isa	23	53	10	But the LORD was pleased To crush Him, putting Him to grief; If He would render Himself as a guilt offering, He will see His offspring, He will prolong His days, And the good pleasure of the LORD will prosper in His hand.
Isaiah	Isa	23	53	11	As a result of the anguish of His soul, He will see it and be satisfied; By His knowledge the Righteous One, My Servant, will justify the many, As He will bear their iniquities.
Isaiah	Isa	23	53	12	Therefore, I will allot Him a portion with the great, And He will divide the booty with the strong; Because He poured out Himself to death, And was numbered with the transgressors; Yet He Himself bore the sin of many, And interceded for the transgressors.
Isaiah	Isa	23	54	1	"Shout for joy, O barren one, you who have borne no child; Break forth into joyful shouting and cry aloud, you who have not travailed; For the sons of the desolate one will be more numerous Than the sons of the married woman," says the LORD.
Isaiah	Isa	23	54	2	"Enlarge the place of your tent; Stretch out the curtains of your dwellings, spare not; Lengthen your cords And strengthen your pegs.
Isaiah	Isa	23	54	3	"For you will spread abroad to the right and to the left. And your descendants will possess nations And will resettle the desolate cities.
Isaiah	Isa	23	54	4	"Fear not, for you will not be put to shame; And do not feel humiliated, for you will not be disgraced; But you will forget the shame of your youth, And the reproach of your widowhood you will remember no more.
Isaiah	Isa	23	54	5	"For your husband is your Maker, Whose name is the LORD of hosts; And your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel, Who is called the God of all the earth.
Isaiah	Isa	23	54	6	"For the LORD has called you, Like a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit, Even like a wife of one's youth when she is rejected," Says your God.
Isaiah	Isa	23	54	7	"For a brief moment I forsook you, But with great compassion I will gather you.
Isaiah	Isa	23	54	8	"In an outburst of anger I hid My face from you for a moment, But with everlasting lovingkindness I will have compassion on you," Says the LORD your Redeemer.
Isaiah	Isa	23	54	9	"For this is like the days of Noah to Me, When I swore that the waters of Noah Would not flood the earth again; So I have sworn that I will not be angry with you Nor will I rebuke you.
Isaiah	Isa	23	54	10	"For the mountains may be removed and the hills may shake, But My lovingkindness will not be removed from you, And My covenant of peace will not be shaken," Says the LORD who has compassion on you.
Isaiah	Isa	23	54	11	"O afflicted one, storm-tossed, and not comforted, Behold, I will set your stones in antimony, And your foundations I will lay in sapphires.
Isaiah	Isa	23	54	12	"Moreover, I will make your battlements of rubies, And your gates of crystal, And your entire wall of precious stones.
Isaiah	Isa	23	54	13	"All your sons will be taught of the LORD; And the well-being of your sons will be great.
Isaiah	Isa	23	54	14	"In righteousness you will be established; You will be far from oppression, for you will not fear; And from terror, for it will not come near you.
Isaiah	Isa	23	54	15	"If anyone fiercely assails you it will not be from Me. Whoever assails you will fall because of you.
Isaiah	Isa	23	54	16	"Behold, I Myself have created the smith who blows the fire of coals And brings out a weapon for its work; And I have created the destroyer to ruin.
Isaiah	Isa	23	54	17	"No weapon that is formed against you will prosper; And every tongue that accuses you in judgment you will condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, And their vindication is from Me," declares the LORD.
Isaiah	Isa	23	55	1	"Ho! Every one who thirsts, come to the waters; And you who have no money come, buy and eat. Come, buy wine and milk Without money and without cost.
Isaiah	Isa	23	55	2	"Why do you spend money for what is not bread, And your wages for what does not satisfy? Listen carefully to Me, and eat what is good, And delight yourself in abundance.
Isaiah	Isa	23	55	3	"Incline your ear and come to Me. Listen, that you may live; And I will make an everlasting covenant with you, According to the faithful mercies shown to David.
Isaiah	Isa	23	55	4	"Behold, I have made him a witness to the peoples, A leader and commander for the peoples.
Isaiah	Isa	23	55	5	"Behold, you will call a nation you do not know, And a nation which knows you not will run to you, Because of the LORD your God, even the Holy One of Israel; For He has glorified you."
Isaiah	Isa	23	55	6	Seek the LORD while He may be found; Call upon Him while He is near.
Isaiah	Isa	23	55	7	Let the wicked forsake his way And the unrighteous man his thoughts; And let him return to the LORD, And He will have compassion on him, And to our God, For He will abundantly pardon.
Isaiah	Isa	23	55	8	"For My thoughts are not your thoughts, Nor are your ways My ways," declares the LORD.
Isaiah	Isa	23	55	9	"For as the heavens are higher than the earth, So are My ways higher than your ways And My thoughts than your thoughts.
Isaiah	Isa	23	55	10	"For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven, And do not return there without watering the earth And making it bear and sprout, And furnishing seed to the sower and bread to the eater;
Isaiah	Isa	23	55	11	So will My word be which goes forth from My mouth; It will not return to Me empty, Without accomplishing what I desire, And without succeeding in the matter for which I sent it.
Isaiah	Isa	23	55	12	"For you will go out with joy And be led forth with peace; The mountains and the hills will break forth into shouts of joy before you, And all the trees of the field will clap their hands.
Isaiah	Isa	23	55	13	"Instead of the thorn bush the cypress will come up, And instead of the nettle the myrtle will come up, And it will be a memorial to the LORD, For an everlasting sign which will not be cut off."
Isaiah	Isa	23	56	1	Thus says the LORD, "Preserve justice and do righteousness, For My salvation is about to come And My righteousness to be revealed.
Isaiah	Isa	23	56	2	"How blessed is the man who does this, And the son of man who takes hold of it; Who keeps from profaning the sabbath, And keeps his hand from doing any evil."
Isaiah	Isa	23	56	3	Let not the foreigner who has joined himself to the LORD say, "The LORD will surely separate me from His people." Nor let the eunuch say, "Behold, I am a dry tree."
Isaiah	Isa	23	56	4	For thus says the LORD, "To the eunuchs who keep My sabbaths, And choose what pleases Me, And hold fast My covenant,
Isaiah	Isa	23	56	5	To them I will give in My house and within My walls a memorial, And a name better than that of sons and daughters; I will give them an everlasting name which will not be cut off.
Isaiah	Isa	23	56	6	"Also the foreigners who join themselves to the LORD, To minister to Him, and to love the name of the LORD, To be His servants, every one who keeps from profaning the sabbath And holds fast My covenant;
Isaiah	Isa	23	56	7	Even those I will bring to My holy mountain And make them joyful in My house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be acceptable on My altar; For My house will be called a house of prayer for all the peoples."
Isaiah	Isa	23	56	8	The Lord GOD, who gathers the dispersed of Israel, declares, "Yet others I will gather to them, to those already gathered."
Isaiah	Isa	23	56	9	All you beasts of the field, All you beasts in the forest, Come to eat.
Isaiah	Isa	23	56	10	His watchmen are blind, All of them know nothing. All of them are mute dogs unable to bark, Dreamers lying down, who love to slumber;
Isaiah	Isa	23	56	11	And the dogs are greedy, they are not satisfied. And they are shepherds who have no understanding; They have all turned to their own way, Each one to his unjust gain, to the last one.
Isaiah	Isa	23	56	12	"Come," they say, "let us get wine, and let us drink heavily of strong drink; And tomorrow will be like today, only more so."
Isaiah	Isa	23	57	1	The righteous man perishes, and no man takes it to heart; And devout men are taken away, while no one understands. For the righteous man is taken away from evil,
Isaiah	Isa	23	57	2	He enters into peace; They rest in their beds, Each one who walked in his upright way.
Isaiah	Isa	23	57	3	"But come here, you sons of a sorceress, Offspring of an adulterer and a prostitute.
Isaiah	Isa	23	57	4	"Against whom do you jest? Against whom do you open wide your mouth And stick out your tongue? Are you not children of rebellion, Offspring of deceit,
Isaiah	Isa	23	57	5	Who inflame yourselves among the oaks, Under every luxuriant tree, Who slaughter the children in the ravines, Under the clefts of the crags?
Isaiah	Isa	23	57	6	"Among the smooth stones of the ravine Is your portion, they are your lot; Even to them you have poured out a drink offering, You have made a grain offering. Shall I relent concerning these things?
Isaiah	Isa	23	57	7	"Upon a high and lofty mountain You have made your bed. You also went up there to offer sacrifice.
Isaiah	Isa	23	57	8	"Behind the door and the doorpost You have set up your sign; Indeed, far removed from Me, you have uncovered yourself, And have gone up and made your bed wide. And you have made an agreement for yourself with them, You have loved their bed, You have looked on their manhood.
Isaiah	Isa	23	57	9	"You have journeyed to the king with oil And increased your perfumes; You have sent your envoys a great distance And made them go down to Sheol.
Isaiah	Isa	23	57	10	"You were tired out by the length of your road, Yet you did not say, 'It is hopeless.' You found renewed strength, Therefore you did not faint.
Isaiah	Isa	23	57	11	"Of whom were you worried and fearful When you lied, and did not remember Me Nor give Me a thought? Was I not silent even for a long time So you do not fear Me?
Isaiah	Isa	23	57	12	"I will declare your righteousness and your deeds, But they will not profit you.
Isaiah	Isa	23	57	13	"When you cry out, let your collection of idols deliver you. But the wind will carry all of them up, And a breath will take them away. But he who takes refuge in Me will inherit the land And will possess My holy mountain."
Isaiah	Isa	23	57	14	And it will be said, "Build up, build up, prepare the way, Remove every obstacle out of the way of My people."
Isaiah	Isa	23	57	15	For thus says the high and exalted One Who lives forever, whose name is Holy, "I dwell on a high and holy place, And also with the contrite and lowly of spirit In order to revive the spirit of the lowly And to revive the heart of the contrite.
Isaiah	Isa	23	57	16	"For I will not contend forever, Nor will I always be angry; For the spirit would grow faint before Me, And the breath of those whom I have made.
Isaiah	Isa	23	57	17	"Because of the iniquity of his unjust gain I was angry and struck him; I hid My face and was angry, And he went on turning away, in the way of his heart.
Isaiah	Isa	23	57	18	"I have seen his ways, but I will heal him; I will lead him and restore comfort to him and to his mourners,
Isaiah	Isa	23	57	19	Creating the praise of the lips. Peace, peace to him who is far and to him who is near," Says the LORD, "and I will heal him."
Isaiah	Isa	23	57	20	But the wicked are like the tossing sea, For it cannot be quiet, And its waters toss up refuse and mud.
Isaiah	Isa	23	57	21	"There is no peace," says my God, "for the wicked."
Isaiah	Isa	23	58	1	"Cry loudly, do not hold back; Raise your voice like a trumpet, And declare to My people their transgression And to the house of Jacob their sins.
Isaiah	Isa	23	58	2	"Yet they seek Me day by day and delight to know My ways, As a nation that has done righteousness And has not forsaken the ordinance of their God. They ask Me for just decisions, They delight in the nearness of God.
Isaiah	Isa	23	58	3	'Why have we fasted and You do not see? Why have we humbled ourselves and You do not notice?' Behold, on the day of your fast you find your desire, And drive hard all your workers.
Isaiah	Isa	23	58	4	"Behold, you fast for contention and strife and to strike with a wicked fist. You do not fast like you do today to make your voice heard on high.
Isaiah	Isa	23	58	5	"Is it a fast like this which I choose, a day for a man to humble himself? Is it for bowing one's head like a reed And for spreading out sackcloth and ashes as a bed? Will you call this a fast, even an acceptable day to the LORD?
Isaiah	Isa	23	58	6	"Is this not the fast which I choose, To loosen the bonds of wickedness, To undo the bands of the yoke, And to let the oppressed go free And break every yoke?
Isaiah	Isa	23	58	7	"Is it not to divide your bread with the hungry And bring the homeless poor into the house; When you see the naked, to cover him; And not to hide yourself from your own flesh?
Isaiah	Isa	23	58	8	"Then your light will break out like the dawn, And your recovery will speedily spring forth; And your righteousness will go before you; The glory of the LORD will be your rear guard.
Isaiah	Isa	23	58	9	"Then you will call, and the LORD will answer; You will cry, and He will say, 'Here I am.' If you remove the yoke from your midst, The pointing of the finger and speaking wickedness,
Isaiah	Isa	23	58	10	And if you give yourself to the hungry And satisfy the desire of the afflicted, Then your light will rise in darkness And your gloom will become like midday.
Isaiah	Isa	23	58	11	"And the LORD will continually guide you, And satisfy your desire in scorched places, And give strength to your bones; And you will be like a watered garden, And like a spring of water whose waters do not fail.
Isaiah	Isa	23	58	12	"Those from among you will rebuild the ancient ruins; You will raise up the age-old foundations; And you will be called the repairer of the breach, The restorer of the streets in which to dwell.
Isaiah	Isa	23	58	13	"If because of the sabbath, you turn your foot From doing your own pleasure on My holy day, And call the sabbath a delight, the holy day of the LORD honorable, And honor it, desisting from your own ways, From seeking your own pleasure And speaking your own word,
Isaiah	Isa	23	58	14	Then you will take delight in the LORD, And I will make you ride on the heights of the earth; And I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father, For the mouth of the LORD has spoken."
Isaiah	Isa	23	59	1	Behold, the LORD'S hand is not so short That it cannot save; Nor is His ear so dull That it cannot hear.
Isaiah	Isa	23	59	2	But your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God, And your sins have hidden His face from you so that He does not hear.
Isaiah	Isa	23	59	3	For your hands are defiled with blood And your fingers with iniquity; Your lips have spoken falsehood, Your tongue mutters wickedness.
Isaiah	Isa	23	59	4	No one sues righteously and no one pleads honestly. They trust in confusion and speak lies; They conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity.
Isaiah	Isa	23	59	5	They hatch adders' eggs and weave the spider's web; He who eats of their eggs dies, And from that which is crushed a snake breaks forth.
Isaiah	Isa	23	59	6	Their webs will not become clothing, Nor will they cover themselves with their works; Their works are works of iniquity, And an act of violence is in their hands.
Isaiah	Isa	23	59	7	Their feet run to evil, And they hasten to shed innocent blood; Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity, Devastation and destruction are in their highways.
Isaiah	Isa	23	59	8	They do not know the way of peace, And there is no justice in their tracks; They have made their paths crooked, Whoever treads on them does not know peace.
Isaiah	Isa	23	59	9	Therefore justice is far from us, And righteousness does not overtake us; We hope for light, but behold, darkness, For brightness, but we walk in gloom.
Isaiah	Isa	23	59	10	We grope along the wall like blind men, We grope like those who have no eyes; We stumble at midday as in the twilight, Among those who are vigorous we are like dead men.
Isaiah	Isa	23	59	11	All of us growl like bears, And moan sadly like doves; We hope for justice, but there is none, For salvation, but it is far from us.
Isaiah	Isa	23	59	12	For our transgressions are multiplied before You, And our sins testify against us; For our transgressions are with us, And we know our iniquities:
Isaiah	Isa	23	59	13	Transgressing and denying the LORD, And turning away from our God, Speaking oppression and revolt, Conceiving in and uttering from the heart lying words.
Isaiah	Isa	23	59	14	Justice is turned back, And righteousness stands far away; For truth has stumbled in the street, And uprightness cannot enter.
Isaiah	Isa	23	59	15	Yes, truth is lacking; And he who turns aside from evil makes himself a prey. Now the LORD saw, And it was displeasing in His sight that there was no justice.
Isaiah	Isa	23	59	16	And He saw that there was no man, And was astonished that there was no one to intercede; Then His own arm brought salvation to Him, And His righteousness upheld Him.
Isaiah	Isa	23	59	17	He put on righteousness like a breastplate, And a helmet of salvation on His head; And He put on garments of vengeance for clothing And wrapped Himself with zeal as a mantle.
Isaiah	Isa	23	59	18	According to their deeds, so He will repay, Wrath to His adversaries, recompense to His enemies; To the coastlands He will make recompense.
Isaiah	Isa	23	59	19	So they will fear the name of the LORD from the west And His glory from the rising of the sun, For He will come like a rushing stream Which the wind of the LORD drives.
Isaiah	Isa	23	59	20	"A Redeemer will come to Zion, And to those who turn from transgression in Jacob," declares the LORD.
Isaiah	Isa	23	59	21	"As for Me, this is My covenant with them," says the LORD: "My Spirit which is upon you, and My words which I have put in your mouth shall not depart from your mouth, nor from the mouth of your offspring, nor from the mouth of your offspring's offspring," says the LORD, "from now and forever."
Isaiah	Isa	23	60	1	"Arise, shine; for your light has come, And the glory of the LORD has risen upon you.
Isaiah	Isa	23	60	2	"For behold, darkness will cover the earth And deep darkness the peoples; But the LORD will rise upon you And His glory will appear upon you.
Isaiah	Isa	23	60	3	"Nations will come to your light, And kings to the brightness of your rising.
Isaiah	Isa	23	60	4	"Lift up your eyes round about and see; They all gather together, they come to you. Your sons will come from afar, And your daughters will be carried in the arms.
Isaiah	Isa	23	60	5	"Then you will see and be radiant, And your heart will thrill and rejoice; Because the abundance of the sea will be turned to you, The wealth of the nations will come to you.
Isaiah	Isa	23	60	6	"A multitude of camels will cover you, The young camels of Midian and Ephah; All those from Sheba will come; They will bring gold and frankincense, And will bear good news of the praises of the LORD.
Isaiah	Isa	23	60	7	"All the flocks of Kedar will be gathered together to you, The rams of Nebaioth will minister to you; They will go up with acceptance on My altar, And I shall glorify My glorious house.
Isaiah	Isa	23	60	8	"Who are these who fly like a cloud And like the doves to their lattices?
Isaiah	Isa	23	60	9	"Surely the coastlands will wait for Me; And the ships of Tarshish will come first, To bring your sons from afar, Their silver and their gold with them, For the name of the LORD your God, And for the Holy One of Israel because He has glorified you.
Isaiah	Isa	23	60	10	"Foreigners will build up your walls, And their kings will minister to you; For in My wrath I struck you, And in My favor I have had compassion on you.
Isaiah	Isa	23	60	11	"Your gates will be open continually; They will not be closed day or night, So that men may bring to you the wealth of the nations, With their kings led in procession.
Isaiah	Isa	23	60	12	"For the nation and the kingdom which will not serve you will perish, And the nations will be utterly ruined.
Isaiah	Isa	23	60	13	"The glory of Lebanon will come to you, The juniper, the box tree and the cypress together, To beautify the place of My sanctuary; And I shall make the place of My feet glorious.
Isaiah	Isa	23	60	14	"The sons of those who afflicted you will come bowing to you, And all those who despised you will bow themselves at the soles of your feet; And they will call you the city of the LORD, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
Isaiah	Isa	23	60	15	"Whereas you have been forsaken and hated With no one passing through, I will make you an everlasting pride, A joy from generation to generation.
Isaiah	Isa	23	60	16	"You will also suck the milk of nations And suck the breast of kings; Then you will know that I, the LORD, am your Savior And your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
Isaiah	Isa	23	60	17	"Instead of bronze I will bring gold, And instead of iron I will bring silver, And instead of wood, bronze, And instead of stones, iron. And I will make peace your administrators And righteousness your overseers.
Isaiah	Isa	23	60	18	"Violence will not be heard again in your land, Nor devastation or destruction within your borders; But you will call your walls salvation, and your gates praise.
Isaiah	Isa	23	60	19	"No longer will you have the sun for light by day, Nor for brightness will the moon give you light; But you will have the LORD for an everlasting light, And your God for your glory.
Isaiah	Isa	23	60	20	"Your sun will no longer set, Nor will your moon wane; For you will have the LORD for an everlasting light, And the days of your mourning will be over.
Isaiah	Isa	23	60	21	"Then all your people will be righteous; They will possess the land forever, The branch of My planting, The work of My hands, That I may be glorified.
Isaiah	Isa	23	60	22	"The smallest one will become a clan, And the least one a mighty nation. I, the LORD, will hasten it in its time."
Isaiah	Isa	23	61	1	The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, Because the LORD has anointed me To bring good news to the afflicted; He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, To proclaim liberty to captives And freedom to prisoners;
Isaiah	Isa	23	61	2	To proclaim the favorable year of the LORD And the day of vengeance of our God; To comfort all who mourn,
Isaiah	Isa	23	61	3	To grant those who mourn in Zion, Giving them a garland instead of ashes, The oil of gladness instead of mourning, The mantle of praise instead of a spirit of fainting. So they will be called oaks of righteousness, The planting of the LORD, that He may be glorified.
Isaiah	Isa	23	61	4	Then they will rebuild the ancient ruins, They will raise up the former devastations; And they will repair the ruined cities, The desolations of many generations.
Isaiah	Isa	23	61	5	Strangers will stand and pasture your flocks, And foreigners will be your farmers and your vinedressers.
Isaiah	Isa	23	61	6	But you will be called the priests of the LORD; You will be spoken of as ministers of our God. You will eat the wealth of nations, And in their riches you will boast.
Isaiah	Isa	23	61	7	Instead of your shame you will have a double portion, And instead of humiliation they will shout for joy over their portion. Therefore they will possess a double portion in their land, Everlasting joy will be theirs.
Isaiah	Isa	23	61	8	For I, the LORD, love justice, I hate robbery in the burnt offering; And I will faithfully give them their recompense And make an everlasting covenant with them.
Isaiah	Isa	23	61	9	Then their offspring will be known among the nations, And their descendants in the midst of the peoples. All who see them will recognize them Because they are the offspring whom the LORD has blessed.
Isaiah	Isa	23	61	10	I will rejoice greatly in the LORD, My soul will exult in my God; For He has clothed me with garments of salvation, He has wrapped me with a robe of righteousness, As a bridegroom decks himself with a garland, And as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.
Isaiah	Isa	23	61	11	For as the earth brings forth its sprouts, And as a garden causes the things sown in it to spring up, So the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise To spring up before all the nations.
Isaiah	Isa	23	62	1	For Zion's sake I will not keep silent, And for Jerusalem's sake I will not keep quiet, Until her righteousness goes forth like brightness, And her salvation like a torch that is burning.
Isaiah	Isa	23	62	2	The nations will see your righteousness, And all kings your glory; And you will be called by a new name Which the mouth of the LORD will designate.
Isaiah	Isa	23	62	3	You will also be a crown of beauty in the hand of the LORD, And a royal diadem in the hand of your God.
Isaiah	Isa	23	62	4	It will no longer be said to you, "Forsaken," Nor to your land will it any longer be said, "Desolate"; But you will be called, "My delight is in her," And your land, "Married"; For the LORD delights in you, And to Him your land will be married.
Isaiah	Isa	23	62	5	For as a young man marries a virgin, So your sons will marry you; And as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, So your God will rejoice over you.
Isaiah	Isa	23	62	6	On your walls, O Jerusalem, I have appointed watchmen; All day and all night they will never keep silent. You who remind the LORD, take no rest for yourselves;
Isaiah	Isa	23	62	7	And give Him no rest until He establishes And makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth.
Isaiah	Isa	23	62	8	The LORD has sworn by His right hand and by His strong arm, "I will never again give your grain as food for your enemies; Nor will foreigners drink your new wine for which you have labored."
Isaiah	Isa	23	62	9	But those who garner it will eat it and praise the LORD; And those who gather it will drink it in the courts of My sanctuary.
Isaiah	Isa	23	62	10	Go through, go through the gates, Clear the way for the people; Build up, build up the highway, Remove the stones, lift up a standard over the peoples.
Isaiah	Isa	23	62	11	Behold, the LORD has proclaimed to the end of the earth, Say to the daughter of Zion, "Lo, your salvation comes; Behold His reward is with Him, and His recompense before Him."
Isaiah	Isa	23	62	12	And they will call them, "The holy people, The redeemed of the LORD"; And you will be called, "Sought out, a city not forsaken."
Isaiah	Isa	23	63	1	Who is this who comes from Edom, With garments of glowing colors from Bozrah, This One who is majestic in His apparel, Marching in the greatness of His strength? "It is I who speak in righteousness, mighty to save."
Isaiah	Isa	23	63	2	Why is Your apparel red, And Your garments like the one who treads in the wine press?
Isaiah	Isa	23	63	3	"I have trodden the wine trough alone, And from the peoples there was no man with Me. I also trod them in My anger And trampled them in My wrath; And their lifeblood is sprinkled on My garments, And I stained all My raiment.
Isaiah	Isa	23	63	4	"For the day of vengeance was in My heart, And My year of redemption has come.
Isaiah	Isa	23	63	5	"I looked, and there was no one to help, And I was astonished and there was no one to uphold; So My own arm brought salvation to Me, And My wrath upheld Me.
Isaiah	Isa	23	63	6	"I trod down the peoples in My anger And made them drunk in My wrath, And I poured out their lifeblood on the earth."
Isaiah	Isa	23	63	7	I shall make mention of the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, the praises of the LORD, According to all that the LORD has granted us, And the great goodness toward the house of Israel, Which He has granted them according to His compassion And according to the abundance of His lovingkindnesses.
Isaiah	Isa	23	63	8	For He said, "Surely, they are My people, Sons who will not deal falsely." So He became their Savior.
Isaiah	Isa	23	63	9	In all their affliction He was afflicted, And the angel of His presence saved them; In His love and in His mercy He redeemed them, And He lifted them and carried them all the days of old.
Isaiah	Isa	23	63	10	But they rebelled And grieved His Holy Spirit; Therefore He turned Himself to become their enemy, He fought against them.
Isaiah	Isa	23	63	11	Then His people remembered the days of old, of Moses. Where is He who brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of His flock? Where is He who put His Holy Spirit in the midst of them,
Isaiah	Isa	23	63	12	Who caused His glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses, Who divided the waters before them to make for Himself an everlasting name,
Isaiah	Isa	23	63	13	Who led them through the depths? Like the horse in the wilderness, they did not stumble;
Isaiah	Isa	23	63	14	As the cattle which go down into the valley, The Spirit of the LORD gave them rest. So You led Your people, To make for Yourself a glorious name.
Isaiah	Isa	23	63	15	Look down from heaven and see from Your holy and glorious habitation; Where are Your zeal and Your mighty deeds? The stirrings of Your heart and Your compassion are restrained toward me.
Isaiah	Isa	23	63	16	For You are our Father, though Abraham does not know us And Israel does not recognize us. You, O LORD, are our Father, Our Redeemer from of old is Your name.
Isaiah	Isa	23	63	17	Why, O LORD, do You cause us to stray from Your ways And harden our heart from fearing You? Return for the sake of Your servants, the tribes of Your heritage.
Isaiah	Isa	23	63	18	Your holy people possessed Your sanctuary for a little while, Our adversaries have trodden it down.
Isaiah	Isa	23	63	19	We have become like those over whom You have never ruled, Like those who were not called by Your name.
Isaiah	Isa	23	64	1	Oh, that You would rend the heavens and come down, That the mountains might quake at Your presence--
Isaiah	Isa	23	64	2	As fire kindles the brushwood, as fire causes water to boil-- To make Your name known to Your adversaries, That the nations may tremble at Your presence!
Isaiah	Isa	23	64	3	When You did awesome things which we did not expect, You came down, the mountains quaked at Your presence.
Isaiah	Isa	23	64	4	For from days of old they have not heard or perceived by ear, Nor has the eye seen a God besides You, Who acts in behalf of the one who waits for Him.
Isaiah	Isa	23	64	5	You meet him who rejoices in doing righteousness, Who remembers You in Your ways. Behold, You were angry, for we sinned, We continued in them a long time; And shall we be saved?
Isaiah	Isa	23	64	6	For all of us have become like one who is unclean, And all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; And all of us wither like a leaf, And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.
Isaiah	Isa	23	64	7	There is no one who calls on Your name, Who arouses himself to take hold of You; For You have hidden Your face from us And have delivered us into the power of our iniquities.
Isaiah	Isa	23	64	8	But now, O LORD, You are our Father, We are the clay, and You our potter; And all of us are the work of Your hand.
Isaiah	Isa	23	64	9	Do not be angry beyond measure, O LORD, Nor remember iniquity forever; Behold, look now, all of us are Your people.
Isaiah	Isa	23	64	10	Your holy cities have become a wilderness, Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.
Isaiah	Isa	23	64	11	Our holy and beautiful house, Where our fathers praised You, Has been burned by fire; And all our precious things have become a ruin.
Isaiah	Isa	23	64	12	Will You restrain Yourself at these things, O LORD? Will You keep silent and afflict us beyond measure?
Isaiah	Isa	23	65	1	"I permitted Myself to be sought by those who did not ask for Me; I permitted Myself to be found by those who did not seek Me. I said, 'Here am I, here am I,' To a nation which did not call on My name.
Isaiah	Isa	23	65	2	"I have spread out My hands all day long to a rebellious people, Who walk in the way which is not good, following their own thoughts,
Isaiah	Isa	23	65	3	A people who continually provoke Me to My face, Offering sacrifices in gardens and burning incense on bricks;
Isaiah	Isa	23	65	4	Who sit among graves and spend the night in secret places; Who eat swine's flesh, And the broth of unclean meat is in their pots.
Isaiah	Isa	23	65	5	"Who say, 'Keep to yourself, do not come near me, For I am holier than you!' These are smoke in My nostrils, A fire that burns all the day.
Isaiah	Isa	23	65	6	"Behold, it is written before Me, I will not keep silent, but I will repay; I will even repay into their bosom,
Isaiah	Isa	23	65	7	Both their own iniquities and the iniquities of their fathers together," says the LORD. "Because they have burned incense on the mountains And scorned Me on the hills, Therefore I will measure their former work into their bosom."
Isaiah	Isa	23	65	8	Thus says the LORD, "As the new wine is found in the cluster, And one says, 'Do not destroy it, for there is benefit in it,' So I will act on behalf of My servants In order not to destroy all of them.
Isaiah	Isa	23	65	9	"I will bring forth offspring from Jacob, And an heir of My mountains from Judah; Even My chosen ones shall inherit it, And My servants will dwell there.
Isaiah	Isa	23	65	10	"Sharon will be a pasture land for flocks, And the valley of Achor a resting place for herds, For My people who seek Me.
Isaiah	Isa	23	65	11	"But you who forsake the LORD, Who forget My holy mountain, Who set a table for Fortune, And who fill cups with mixed wine for Destiny,
Isaiah	Isa	23	65	12	I will destine you for the sword, And all of you will bow down to the slaughter. Because I called, but you did not answer; I spoke, but you did not hear. And you did evil in My sight And chose that in which I did not delight."
Isaiah	Isa	23	65	13	Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, My servants will eat, but you will be hungry. Behold, My servants will drink, but you will be thirsty. Behold, My servants will rejoice, but you will be put to shame.
Isaiah	Isa	23	65	14	"Behold, My servants will shout joyfully with a glad heart, But you will cry out with a heavy heart, And you will wail with a broken spirit.
Isaiah	Isa	23	65	15	"You will leave your name for a curse to My chosen ones, And the Lord GOD will slay you. But My servants will be called by another name.
Isaiah	Isa	23	65	16	"Because he who is blessed in the earth Will be blessed by the God of truth; And he who swears in the earth Will swear by the God of truth; Because the former troubles are forgotten, And because they are hidden from My sight!
Isaiah	Isa	23	65	17	"For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; And the former things will not be remembered or come to mind.
Isaiah	Isa	23	65	18	"But be glad and rejoice forever in what I create; For behold, I create Jerusalem for rejoicing And her people for gladness.
Isaiah	Isa	23	65	19	"I will also rejoice in Jerusalem and be glad in My people; And there will no longer be heard in her The voice of weeping and the sound of crying.
Isaiah	Isa	23	65	20	"No longer will there be in it an infant who lives but a few days, Or an old man who does not live out his days; For the youth will die at the age of one hundred And the one who does not reach the age of one hundred Will be thought accursed.
Isaiah	Isa	23	65	21	"They will build houses and inhabit them; They will also plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
Isaiah	Isa	23	65	22	"They will not build and another inhabit, They will not plant and another eat; For as the lifetime of a tree, so will be the days of My people, And My chosen ones will wear out the work of their hands.
Isaiah	Isa	23	65	23	"They will not labor in vain, Or bear children for calamity; For they are the offspring of those blessed by the LORD, And their descendants with them.
Isaiah	Isa	23	65	24	"It will also come to pass that before they call, I will answer; and while they are still speaking, I will hear.
Isaiah	Isa	23	65	25	"The wolf and the lamb will graze together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox; and dust will be the serpent's food. They will do no evil or harm in all My holy mountain," says the LORD.
Isaiah	Isa	23	66	1	Thus says the LORD, "Heaven is My throne and the earth is My footstool. Where then is a house you could build for Me? And where is a place that I may rest?
Isaiah	Isa	23	66	2	"For My hand made all these things, Thus all these things came into being," declares the LORD. "But to this one I will look, To him who is humble and contrite of spirit, and who trembles at My word.
Isaiah	Isa	23	66	3	"But he who kills an ox is like one who slays a man; He who sacrifices a lamb is like the one who breaks a dog's neck; He who offers a grain offering is like one who offers swine's blood; He who burns incense is like the one who blesses an idol. As they have chosen their own ways, And their soul delights in their abominations,
Isaiah	Isa	23	66	4	So I will choose their punishments And will bring on them what they dread. Because I called, but no one answered; I spoke, but they did not listen. And they did evil in My sight And chose that in which I did not delight."
Isaiah	Isa	23	66	5	Hear the word of the LORD, you who tremble at His word: "Your brothers who hate you, who exclude you for My name's sake, Have said, 'Let the LORD be glorified, that we may see your joy.' But they will be put to shame.
Isaiah	Isa	23	66	6	"A voice of uproar from the city, a voice from the temple, The voice of the LORD who is rendering recompense to His enemies.
Isaiah	Isa	23	66	7	"Before she travailed, she brought forth; Before her pain came, she gave birth to a boy.
Isaiah	Isa	23	66	8	"Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such things? Can a land be born in one day? Can a nation be brought forth all at once? As soon as Zion travailed, she also brought forth her sons.
Isaiah	Isa	23	66	9	"Shall I bring to the point of birth and not give delivery?" says the LORD. "Or shall I who gives delivery shut the womb?" says your God.
Isaiah	Isa	23	66	10	"Be joyful with Jerusalem and rejoice for her, all you who love her; Be exceedingly glad with her, all you who mourn over her,
Isaiah	Isa	23	66	11	That you may nurse and be satisfied with her comforting breasts, That you may suck and be delighted with her bountiful bosom."
Isaiah	Isa	23	66	12	For thus says the LORD, "Behold, I extend peace to her like a river, And the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream; And you will be nursed, you will be carried on the hip and fondled on the knees.
Isaiah	Isa	23	66	13	"As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you; And you will be comforted in Jerusalem."
Isaiah	Isa	23	66	14	Then you will see this, and your heart will be glad, And your bones will flourish like the new grass; And the hand of the LORD will be made known to His servants, But He will be indignant toward His enemies.
Isaiah	Isa	23	66	15	For behold, the LORD will come in fire And His chariots like the whirlwind, To render His anger with fury, And His rebuke with flames of fire.
Isaiah	Isa	23	66	16	For the LORD will execute judgment by fire And by His sword on all flesh, And those slain by the LORD will be many.
Isaiah	Isa	23	66	17	"Those who sanctify and purify themselves to go to the gardens, Following one in the center, Who eat swine's flesh, detestable things and mice, Will come to an end altogether," declares the LORD.
Isaiah	Isa	23	66	18	"For I know their works and their thoughts; the time is coming to gather all nations and tongues. And they shall come and see My glory.
Isaiah	Isa	23	66	19	"I will set a sign among them and will send survivors from them to the nations: Tarshish, Put, Lud, Meshech, Tubal and Javan, to the distant coastlands that have neither heard My fame nor seen My glory. And they will declare My glory among the nations.
Isaiah	Isa	23	66	20	"Then they shall bring all your brethren from all the nations as a grain offering to the LORD, on horses, in chariots, in litters, on mules and on camels, to My holy mountain Jerusalem," says the LORD, "just as the sons of Israel bring their grain offering in a clean vessel to the house of the LORD.
Isaiah	Isa	23	66	21	"I will also take some of them for priests and for Levites," says the LORD.
Isaiah	Isa	23	66	22	"For just as the new heavens and the new earth Which I make will endure before Me," declares the LORD, "So your offspring and your name will endure.
Isaiah	Isa	23	66	23	"And it shall be from new moon to new moon And from sabbath to sabbath, All mankind will come to bow down before Me," says the LORD.
Isaiah	Isa	23	66	24	"Then they will go forth and look On the corpses of the men Who have transgressed against Me. For their worm will not die And their fire will not be quenched; And they will be an abhorrence to all mankind."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	1	1	The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	1	2	to whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	1	3	It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the exile of Jerusalem in the fifth month.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	1	4	Now the word of the LORD came to me saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	1	5	"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, And before you were born I consecrated you; I have appointed you a prophet to the nations."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	1	6	Then I said, "Alas, Lord GOD! Behold, I do not know how to speak, Because I am a youth."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	1	7	But the LORD said to me, "Do not say, 'I am a youth,' Because everywhere I send you, you shall go, And all that I command you, you shall speak.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	1	8	"Do not be afraid of them, For I am with you to deliver you," declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	1	9	Then the LORD stretched out His hand and touched my mouth, and the LORD said to me, "Behold, I have put My words in your mouth.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	1	10	"See, I have appointed you this day over the nations and over the kingdoms, To pluck up and to break down, To destroy and to overthrow, To build and to plant."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	1	11	The word of the LORD came to me saying, "What do you see, Jeremiah?" And I said, "I see a rod of an almond tree."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	1	12	Then the LORD said to me, "You have seen well, for I am watching over My word to perform it."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	1	13	The word of the LORD came to me a second time saying, "What do you see?" And I said, "I see a boiling pot, facing away from the north."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	1	14	Then the LORD said to me, "Out of the north the evil will break forth on all the inhabitants of the land.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	1	15	"For, behold, I am calling all the families of the kingdoms of the north," declares the LORD; "and they will come and they will set each one his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all its walls round about and against all the cities of Judah.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	1	16	"I will pronounce My judgments on them concerning all their wickedness, whereby they have forsaken Me and have offered sacrifices to other gods, and worshiped the works of their own hands.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	1	17	"Now, gird up your loins and arise, and speak to them all which I command you. Do not be dismayed before them, or I will dismay you before them.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	1	18	"Now behold, I have made you today as a fortified city and as a pillar of iron and as walls of bronze against the whole land, to the kings of Judah, to its princes, to its priests and to the people of the land.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	1	19	"They will fight against you, but they will not overcome you, for I am with you to deliver you," declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	1	Now the word of the LORD came to me saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	2	"Go and proclaim in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, 'Thus says the LORD, "I remember concerning you the devotion of your youth, The love of your betrothals, Your following after Me in the wilderness, Through a land not sown.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	3	"Israel was holy to the LORD, The first of His harvest. All who ate of it became guilty; Evil came upon them," declares the LORD.'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	4	Hear the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	5	Thus says the LORD, "What injustice did your fathers find in Me, That they went far from Me And walked after emptiness and became empty?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	6	"They did not say, 'Where is the LORD Who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, Who led us through the wilderness, Through a land of deserts and of pits, Through a land of drought and of deep darkness, Through a land that no one crossed And where no man dwelt?'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	7	"I brought you into the fruitful land To eat its fruit and its good things. But you came and defiled My land, And My inheritance you made an abomination.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	8	"The priests did not say, 'Where is the LORD?' And those who handle the law did not know Me; The rulers also transgressed against Me, And the prophets prophesied by Baal And walked after things that did not profit.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	9	"Therefore I will yet contend with you," declares the LORD, "And with your sons' sons I will contend.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	10	"For cross to the coastlands of Kittim and see, And send to Kedar and observe closely And see if there has been such a thing as this!
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	11	"Has a nation changed gods When they were not gods? But My people have changed their glory For that which does not profit.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	12	"Be appalled, O heavens, at this, And shudder, be very desolate," declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	13	"For My people have committed two evils: They have forsaken Me, The fountain of living waters, To hew for themselves cisterns, Broken cisterns That can hold no water.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	14	"Is Israel a slave? Or is he a homeborn servant? Why has he become a prey?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	15	"The young lions have roared at him, They have roared loudly. And they have made his land a waste; His cities have been destroyed, without inhabitant.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	16	"Also the men of Memphis and Tahpanhes Have shaved the crown of your head.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	17	"Have you not done this to yourself By your forsaking the LORD your God When He led you in the way?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	18	"But now what are you doing on the road to Egypt, To drink the waters of the Nile? Or what are you doing on the road to Assyria, To drink the waters of the Euphrates?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	19	"Your own wickedness will correct you, And your apostasies will reprove you; Know therefore and see that it is evil and bitter For you to forsake the LORD your God, And the dread of Me is not in you," declares the Lord GOD of hosts.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	20	"For long ago I broke your yoke And tore off your bonds; But you said, 'I will not serve!' For on every high hill And under every green tree You have lain down as a harlot.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	21	"Yet I planted you a choice vine, A completely faithful seed. How then have you turned yourself before Me Into the degenerate shoots of a foreign vine?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	22	"Although you wash yourself with lye And use much soap, The stain of your iniquity is before Me," declares the Lord GOD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	23	"How can you say, 'I am not defiled, I have not gone after the Baals'? Look at your way in the valley! Know what you have done! You are a swift young camel entangling her ways,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	24	A wild donkey accustomed to the wilderness, That sniffs the wind in her passion. In the time of her heat who can turn her away? All who seek her will not become weary; In her month they will find her.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	25	"Keep your feet from being unshod And your throat from thirst; But you said, 'It is hopeless! No! For I have loved strangers, And after them I will walk.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	26	"As the thief is shamed when he is discovered, So the house of Israel is shamed; They, their kings, their princes And their priests and their prophets,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	27	Who say to a tree, 'You are my father,' And to a stone, 'You gave me birth.' For they have turned their back to Me, And not their face; But in the time of their trouble they will say, 'Arise and save us.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	28	"But where are your gods Which you made for yourself? Let them arise, if they can save you In the time of your trouble; For according to the number of your cities Are your gods, O Judah.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	29	"Why do you contend with Me? You have all transgressed against Me," declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	30	"In vain I have struck your sons; They accepted no chastening. Your sword has devoured your prophets Like a destroying lion.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	31	"O generation, heed the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness to Israel, Or a land of thick darkness? Why do My people say, 'We are free to roam; We will no longer come to You'?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	32	"Can a virgin forget her ornaments, Or a bride her attire? Yet My people have forgotten Me Days without number.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	33	"How well you prepare your way To seek love! Therefore even the wicked women You have taught your ways.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	34	"Also on your skirts is found The lifeblood of the innocent poor; You did not find them breaking in. But in spite of all these things,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	35	Yet you said, 'I am innocent; Surely His anger is turned away from me.' Behold, I will enter into judgment with you Because you say, 'I have not sinned.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	36	"Why do you go around so much Changing your way? Also, you will be put to shame by Egypt As you were put to shame by Assyria.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	2	37	"From this place also you will go out With your hands on your head; For the LORD has rejected those in whom you trust, And you will not prosper with them."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	3	1	God says, "If a husband divorces his wife And she goes from him And belongs to another man, Will he still return to her? Will not that land be completely polluted? But you are a harlot with many lovers; Yet you turn to Me," declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	3	2	"Lift up your eyes to the bare heights and see; Where have you not been violated? By the roads you have sat for them Like an Arab in the desert, And you have polluted a land With your harlotry and with your wickedness.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	3	3	"Therefore the showers have been withheld, And there has been no spring rain. Yet you had a harlot's forehead; You refused to be ashamed.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	3	4	"Have you not just now called to Me, 'My Father, You are the friend of my youth?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	3	5	'Will He be angry forever? Will He be indignant to the end?' Behold, you have spoken And have done evil things, And you have had your way."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	3	6	Then the LORD said to me in the days of Josiah the king, "Have you seen what faithless Israel did? She went up on every high hill and under every green tree, and she was a harlot there.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	3	7	"I thought, 'After she has done all these things she will return to Me'; but she did not return, and her treacherous sister Judah saw it.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	3	8	"And I saw that for all the adulteries of faithless Israel, I had sent her away and given her a writ of divorce, yet her treacherous sister Judah did not fear; but she went and was a harlot also.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	3	9	"Because of the lightness of her harlotry, she polluted the land and committed adultery with stones and trees.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	3	10	"Yet in spite of all this her treacherous sister Judah did not return to Me with all her heart, but rather in deception," declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	3	11	And the LORD said to me, "Faithless Israel has proved herself more righteous than treacherous Judah.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	3	12	"Go and proclaim these words toward the north and say, 'Return, faithless Israel,' declares the LORD; 'I will not look upon you in anger. For I am gracious,' declares the LORD; 'I will not be angry forever.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	3	13	'Only acknowledge your iniquity, That you have transgressed against the LORD your God And have scattered your favors to the strangers under every green tree, And you have not obeyed My voice,' declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	3	14	'Return, O faithless sons,' declares the LORD; 'For I am a master to you, And I will take you one from a city and two from a family, And I will bring you to Zion.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	3	15	"Then I will give you shepherds after My own heart, who will feed you on knowledge and understanding.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	3	16	"It shall be in those days when you are multiplied and increased in the land," declares the LORD, "they will no longer say, 'The ark of the covenant of the LORD.' And it will not come to mind, nor will they remember it, nor will they miss it, nor will it be made again.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	3	17	"At that time they will call Jerusalem 'The Throne of the LORD,' and all the nations will be gathered to it, to Jerusalem, for the name of the LORD; nor will they walk anymore after the stubbornness of their evil heart.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	3	18	"In those days the house of Judah will walk with the house of Israel, and they will come together from the land of the north to the land that I gave your fathers as an inheritance.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	3	19	"Then I said, 'How I would set you among My sons And give you a pleasant land, The most beautiful inheritance of the nations!' And I said, 'You shall call Me, My Father, And not turn away from following Me.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	3	20	"Surely, as a woman treacherously departs from her lover, So you have dealt treacherously with Me, O house of Israel," declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	3	21	A voice is heard on the bare heights, The weeping and the supplications of the sons of Israel; Because they have perverted their way, They have forgotten the LORD their God.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	3	22	"Return, O faithless sons, I will heal your faithlessness." "Behold, we come to You; For You are the LORD our God.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	3	23	"Surely, the hills are a deception, A tumult on the mountains. Surely in the LORD our God Is the salvation of Israel.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	3	24	"But the shameful thing has consumed the labor of our fathers since our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	3	25	"Let us lie down in our shame, and let our humiliation cover us; for we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day. And we have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	4	1	"If you will return, O Israel," declares the LORD, "Then you should return to Me. And if you will put away your detested things from My presence, And will not waver,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	4	2	And you will swear, 'As the LORD lives,' In truth, in justice and in righteousness; Then the nations will bless themselves in Him, And in Him they will glory."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	4	3	For thus says the LORD to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, "Break up your fallow ground, And do not sow among thorns.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	4	4	"Circumcise yourselves to the LORD And remove the foreskins of your heart, Men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, Or else My wrath will go forth like fire And burn with none to quench it, Because of the evil of your deeds."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	4	5	Declare in Judah and proclaim in Jerusalem, and say, "Blow the trumpet in the land; Cry aloud and say, 'Assemble yourselves, and let us go Into the fortified cities.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	4	6	"Lift up a standard toward Zion! Seek refuge, do not stand still, For I am bringing evil from the north, And great destruction.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	4	7	"A lion has gone up from his thicket, And a destroyer of nations has set out; He has gone out from his place To make your land a waste. Your cities will be ruins Without inhabitant.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	4	8	"For this, put on sackcloth, Lament and wail; For the fierce anger of the LORD Has not turned back from us."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	4	9	"It shall come about in that day," declares the LORD, "that the heart of the king and the heart of the princes will fail; and the priests will be appalled and the prophets will be astounded."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	4	10	Then I said, "Ah, Lord GOD! Surely You have utterly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, 'You will have peace'; whereas a sword touches the throat."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	4	11	In that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, "A scorching wind from the bare heights in the wilderness in the direction of the daughter of My people--not to winnow and not to cleanse,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	4	12	a wind too strong for this--will come at My command; now I will also pronounce judgments against them.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	4	13	"Behold, he goes up like clouds, And his chariots like the whirlwind; His horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us, for we are ruined!"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	4	14	Wash your heart from evil, O Jerusalem, That you may be saved. How long will your wicked thoughts Lodge within you?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	4	15	For a voice declares from Dan, And proclaims wickedness from Mount Ephraim.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	4	16	"Report it to the nations, now! Proclaim over Jerusalem, 'Besiegers come from a far country, And lift their voices against the cities of Judah.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	4	17	'Like watchmen of a field they are against her round about, Because she has rebelled against Me,' declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	4	18	"Your ways and your deeds Have brought these things to you. This is your evil. How bitter! How it has touched your heart!"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	4	19	My soul, my soul! I am in anguish! Oh, my heart! My heart is pounding in me; I cannot be silent, Because you have heard, O my soul, The sound of the trumpet, The alarm of war.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	4	20	Disaster on disaster is proclaimed, For the whole land is devastated; Suddenly my tents are devastated, My curtains in an instant.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	4	21	How long must I see the standard And hear the sound of the trumpet?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	4	22	"For My people are foolish, They know Me not; They are stupid children And have no understanding. They are shrewd to do evil, But to do good they do not know."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	4	23	I looked on the earth, and behold, it was formless and void; And to the heavens, and they had no light.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	4	24	I looked on the mountains, and behold, they were quaking, And all the hills moved to and fro.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	4	25	I looked, and behold, there was no man, And all the birds of the heavens had fled.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	4	26	I looked, and behold, the fruitful land was a wilderness, And all its cities were pulled down Before the LORD, before His fierce anger.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	4	27	For thus says the LORD, "The whole land shall be a desolation, Yet I will not execute a complete destruction.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	4	28	"For this the earth shall mourn And the heavens above be dark, Because I have spoken, I have purposed, And I will not change My mind, nor will I turn from it."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	4	29	At the sound of the horseman and bowman every city flees; They go into the thickets and climb among the rocks; Every city is forsaken, And no man dwells in them.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	4	30	And you, O desolate one, what will you do? Although you dress in scarlet, Although you decorate yourself with ornaments of gold, Although you enlarge your eyes with paint, In vain you make yourself beautiful. Your lovers despise you; They seek your life.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	4	31	For I heard a cry as of a woman in labor, The anguish as of one giving birth to her first child, The cry of the daughter of Zion gasping for breath, Stretching out her hands, saying, "Ah, woe is me, for I faint before murderers."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	5	1	"Roam to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, And look now and take note. And seek in her open squares, If you can find a man, If there is one who does justice, who seeks truth, Then I will pardon her.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	5	2	"And although they say, 'As the LORD lives,' Surely they swear falsely."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	5	3	O LORD, do not Your eyes look for truth? You have smitten them, But they did not weaken; You have consumed them, But they refused to take correction. They have made their faces harder than rock; They have refused to repent.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	5	4	Then I said, "They are only the poor, They are foolish; For they do not know the way of the LORD Or the ordinance of their God.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	5	5	"I will go to the great And will speak to them, For they know the way of the LORD And the ordinance of their God." But they too, with one accord, have broken the yoke And burst the bonds.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	5	6	Therefore a lion from the forest will slay them, A wolf of the deserts will destroy them, A leopard is watching their cities. Everyone who goes out of them will be torn in pieces, Because their transgressions are many, Their apostasies are numerous.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	5	7	"Why should I pardon you? Your sons have forsaken Me And sworn by those who are not gods. When I had fed them to the full, They committed adultery And trooped to the harlot's house.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	5	8	"They were well-fed lusty horses, Each one neighing after his neighbor's wife.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	5	9	"Shall I not punish these people," declares the LORD, "And on a nation such as this Shall I not avenge Myself?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	5	10	"Go up through her vine rows and destroy, But do not execute a complete destruction; Strip away her branches, For they are not the LORD'S.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	5	11	"For the house of Israel and the house of Judah Have dealt very treacherously with Me," declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	5	12	They have lied about the LORD And said, "Not He; Misfortune will not come on us, And we will not see sword or famine.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	5	13	"The prophets are as wind, And the word is not in them. Thus it will be done to them!"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	5	14	Therefore, thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, "Because you have spoken this word, Behold, I am making My words in your mouth fire And this people wood, and it will consume them.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	5	15	"Behold, I am bringing a nation against you from afar, O house of Israel," declares the LORD. "It is an enduring nation, It is an ancient nation, A nation whose language you do not know, Nor can you understand what they say.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	5	16	"Their quiver is like an open grave, All of them are mighty men.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	5	17	"They will devour your harvest and your food; They will devour your sons and your daughters; They will devour your flocks and your herds; They will devour your vines and your fig trees; They will demolish with the sword your fortified cities in which you trust.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	5	18	"Yet even in those days," declares the LORD, "I will not make you a complete destruction.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	5	19	"It shall come about when they say, 'Why has the LORD our God done all these things to us?' then you shall say to them, 'As you have forsaken Me and served foreign gods in your land, so you will serve strangers in a land that is not yours.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	5	20	"Declare this in the house of Jacob And proclaim it in Judah, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	5	21	'Now hear this, O foolish and senseless people, Who have eyes but do not see; Who have ears but do not hear.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	5	22	'Do you not fear Me?' declares the LORD. 'Do you not tremble in My presence? For I have placed the sand as a boundary for the sea, An eternal decree, so it cannot cross over it. Though the waves toss, yet they cannot prevail; Though they roar, yet they cannot cross over it.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	5	23	'But this people has a stubborn and rebellious heart; They have turned aside and departed.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	5	24	'They do not say in their heart, "Let us now fear the LORD our God, Who gives rain in its season, Both the autumn rain and the spring rain, Who keeps for us The appointed weeks of the harvest."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	5	25	'Your iniquities have turned these away, And your sins have withheld good from you.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	5	26	'For wicked men are found among My people, They watch like fowlers lying in wait; They set a trap, They catch men.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	5	27	'Like a cage full of birds, So their houses are full of deceit; Therefore they have become great and rich.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	5	28	'They are fat, they are sleek, They also excel in deeds of wickedness; They do not plead the cause, The cause of the orphan, that they may prosper; And they do not defend the rights of the poor.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	5	29	'Shall I not punish these people?' declares the LORD, 'On a nation such as this Shall I not avenge Myself?'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	5	30	"An appalling and horrible thing Has happened in the land:
Jeremiah	Jer	24	5	31	The prophets prophesy falsely, And the priests rule on their own authority; And My people love it so! But what will you do at the end of it?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	6	1	"Flee for safety, O sons of Benjamin, From the midst of Jerusalem! Now blow a trumpet in Tekoa And raise a signal over Beth-haccerem; For evil looks down from the north, And a great destruction.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	6	2	"The comely and dainty one, the daughter of Zion, I will cut off.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	6	3	"Shepherds and their flocks will come to her, They will pitch their tents around her, They will pasture each in his place.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	6	4	"Prepare war against her; Arise, and let us attack at noon. Woe to us, for the day declines, For the shadows of the evening lengthen!
Jeremiah	Jer	24	6	5	"Arise, and let us attack by night And destroy her palaces!"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	6	6	For thus says the LORD of hosts, "Cut down her trees And cast up a siege against Jerusalem. This is the city to be punished, In whose midst there is only oppression.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	6	7	"As a well keeps its waters fresh, So she keeps fresh her wickedness. Violence and destruction are heard in her; Sickness and wounds are ever before Me.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	6	8	"Be warned, O Jerusalem, Or I shall be alienated from you, And make you a desolation, A land not inhabited."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	6	9	Thus says the LORD of hosts, "They will thoroughly glean as the vine the remnant of Israel; Pass your hand again like a grape gatherer Over the branches."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	6	10	To whom shall I speak and give warning That they may hear? Behold, their ears are closed And they cannot listen. Behold, the word of the LORD has become a reproach to them; They have no delight in it.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	6	11	But I am full of the wrath of the LORD; I am weary with holding it in. "Pour it out on the children in the street And on the gathering of young men together; For both husband and wife shall be taken, The aged and the very old.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	6	12	"Their houses shall be turned over to others, Their fields and their wives together; For I will stretch out My hand Against the inhabitants of the land," declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	6	13	"For from the least of them even to the greatest of them, Everyone is greedy for gain, And from the prophet even to the priest Everyone deals falsely.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	6	14	"They have healed the brokenness of My people superficially, Saying, 'Peace, peace,' But there is no peace.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	6	15	"Were they ashamed because of the abomination they have done? They were not even ashamed at all; They did not even know how to blush. Therefore they shall fall among those who fall; At the time that I punish them, They shall be cast down," says the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	6	16	Thus says the LORD, "Stand by the ways and see and ask for the ancient paths, Where the good way is, and walk in it; And you will find rest for your souls. But they said, 'We will not walk in it.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	6	17	"And I set watchmen over you, saying, 'Listen to the sound of the trumpet!' But they said, 'We will not listen.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	6	18	"Therefore hear, O nations, And know, O congregation, what is among them.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	6	19	"Hear, O earth: behold, I am bringing disaster on this people, The fruit of their plans, Because they have not listened to My words, And as for My law, they have rejected it also.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	6	20	"For what purpose does frankincense come to Me from Sheba And the sweet cane from a distant land? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable And your sacrifices are not pleasing to Me."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	6	21	Therefore, thus says the LORD, "Behold, I am laying stumbling blocks before this people. And they will stumble against them, Fathers and sons together; Neighbor and friend will perish."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	6	22	Thus says the LORD, "Behold, a people is coming from the north land, And a great nation will be aroused from the remote parts of the earth.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	6	23	"They seize bow and spear; They are cruel and have no mercy; Their voice roars like the sea, And they ride on horses, Arrayed as a man for the battle Against you, O daughter of Zion!"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	6	24	We have heard the report of it; Our hands are limp. Anguish has seized us, Pain as of a woman in childbirth.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	6	25	Do not go out into the field And do not walk on the road, For the enemy has a sword, Terror is on every side.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	6	26	O daughter of my people, put on sackcloth And roll in ashes; Mourn as for an only son, A lamentation most bitter. For suddenly the destroyer Will come upon us.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	6	27	"I have made you an assayer and a tester among My people, That you may know and assay their way."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	6	28	All of them are stubbornly rebellious, Going about as a talebearer. They are bronze and iron; They, all of them, are corrupt.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	6	29	The bellows blow fiercely, The lead is consumed by the fire; In vain the refining goes on, But the wicked are not separated.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	6	30	They call them rejected silver, Because the LORD has rejected them.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	7	1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	7	2	"Stand in the gate of the LORD'S house and proclaim there this word and say, 'Hear the word of the LORD, all you of Judah, who enter by these gates to worship the LORD!'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	7	3	Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "Amend your ways and your deeds, and I will let you dwell in this place.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	7	4	"Do not trust in deceptive words, saying, 'This is the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	7	5	"For if you truly amend your ways and your deeds, if you truly practice justice between a man and his neighbor,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	7	6	if you do not oppress the alien, the orphan, or the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place, nor walk after other gods to your own ruin,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	7	7	then I will let you dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers forever and ever.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	7	8	"Behold, you are trusting in deceptive words to no avail.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	7	9	"Will you steal, murder, and commit adultery and swear falsely, and offer sacrifices to Baal and walk after other gods that you have not known,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	7	10	then come and stand before Me in this house, which is called by My name, and say, 'We are delivered!'--that you may do all these abominations?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	7	11	"Has this house, which is called by My name, become a den of robbers in your sight? Behold, I, even I, have seen it," declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	7	12	"But go now to My place which was in Shiloh, where I made My name dwell at the first, and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of My people Israel.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	7	13	"And now, because you have done all these things," declares the LORD, "and I spoke to you, rising up early and speaking, but you did not hear, and I called you but you did not answer,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	7	14	therefore, I will do to the house which is called by My name, in which you trust, and to the place which I gave you and your fathers, as I did to Shiloh.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	7	15	"I will cast you out of My sight, as I have cast out all your brothers, all the offspring of Ephraim.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	7	16	"As for you, do not pray for this people, and do not lift up cry or prayer for them, and do not intercede with Me; for I do not hear you.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	7	17	"Do you not see what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	7	18	"The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead dough to make cakes for the queen of heaven; and they pour out drink offerings to other gods in order to spite Me.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	7	19	"Do they spite Me?" declares the LORD. "Is it not themselves they spite, to their own shame?"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	7	20	Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, My anger and My wrath will be poured out on this place, on man and on beast and on the trees of the field and on the fruit of the ground; and it will burn and not be quenched."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	7	21	Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices and eat flesh.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	7	22	"For I did not speak to your fathers, or command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings and sacrifices.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	7	23	"But this is what I commanded them, saying, 'Obey My voice, and I will be your God, and you will be My people; and you will walk in all the way which I command you, that it may be well with you.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	7	24	"Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but walked in their own counsels and in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and went backward and not forward.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	7	25	"Since the day that your fathers came out of the land of Egypt until this day, I have sent you all My servants the prophets, daily rising early and sending them.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	7	26	"Yet they did not listen to Me or incline their ear, but stiffened their neck; they did more evil than their fathers.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	7	27	"You shall speak all these words to them, but they will not listen to you; and you shall call to them, but they will not answer you.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	7	28	"You shall say to them, 'This is the nation that did not obey the voice of the LORD their God or accept correction; truth has perished and has been cut off from their mouth.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	7	29	'Cut off your hair and cast it away, And take up a lamentation on the bare heights; For the LORD has rejected and forsaken The generation of His wrath.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	7	30	"For the sons of Judah have done that which is evil in My sight," declares the LORD, "they have set their detestable things in the house which is called by My name, to defile it.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	7	31	"They have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, which I did not command, and it did not come into My mind.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	7	32	"Therefore, behold, days are coming," declares the LORD, "when it will no longer be called Topheth, or the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of the Slaughter; for they will bury in Topheth because there is no other place.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	7	33	"The dead bodies of this people will be food for the birds of the sky and for the beasts of the earth; and no one will frighten them away.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	7	34	"Then I will make to cease from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; for the land will become a ruin.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	8	1	"At that time," declares the LORD, "they will bring out the bones of the kings of Judah and the bones of its princes, and the bones of the priests and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem from their graves.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	8	2	"They will spread them out to the sun, the moon and to all the host of heaven, which they have loved and which they have served, and which they have gone after and which they have sought, and which they have worshiped. They will not be gathered or buried; they will be as dung on the face of the ground.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	8	3	"And death will be chosen rather than life by all the remnant that remains of this evil family, that remains in all the places to which I have driven them," declares the LORD of hosts.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	8	4	"You shall say to them, 'Thus says the LORD, "Do men fall and not get up again? Does one turn away and not repent?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	8	5	"Why then has this people, Jerusalem, Turned away in continual apostasy? They hold fast to deceit, They refuse to return.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	8	6	"I have listened and heard, They have spoken what is not right; No man repented of his wickedness, Saying, 'What have I done?' Everyone turned to his course, Like a horse charging into the battle.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	8	7	"Even the stork in the sky Knows her seasons; And the turtledove and the swift and the thrush Observe the time of their migration; But My people do not know The ordinance of the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	8	8	"How can you say, 'We are wise, And the law of the LORD is with us'? But behold, the lying pen of the scribes Has made it into a lie.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	8	9	"The wise men are put to shame, They are dismayed and caught; Behold, they have rejected the word of the LORD, And what kind of wisdom do they have?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	8	10	"Therefore I will give their wives to others, Their fields to new owners; Because from the least even to the greatest Everyone is greedy for gain; From the prophet even to the priest Everyone practices deceit.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	8	11	"They heal the brokenness of the daughter of My people superficially, Saying, 'Peace, peace,' But there is no peace.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	8	12	"Were they ashamed because of the abomination they had done? They certainly were not ashamed, And they did not know how to blush; Therefore they shall fall among those who fall; At the time of their punishment they shall be brought down," Says the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	8	13	"I will surely snatch them away," declares the LORD; "There will be no grapes on the vine And no figs on the fig tree, And the leaf will wither; And what I have given them will pass away."'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	8	14	Why are we sitting still? Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the fortified cities And let us perish there, Because the LORD our God has doomed us And given us poisoned water to drink, For we have sinned against the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	8	15	We waited for peace, but no good came; For a time of healing, but behold, terror!
Jeremiah	Jer	24	8	16	From Dan is heard the snorting of his horses; At the sound of the neighing of his stallions The whole land quakes; For they come and devour the land and its fullness, The city and its inhabitants.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	8	17	"For behold, I am sending serpents against you, Adders, for which there is no charm, And they will bite you," declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	8	18	My sorrow is beyond healing, My heart is faint within me!
Jeremiah	Jer	24	8	19	Behold, listen! The cry of the daughter of my people from a distant land: "Is the LORD not in Zion? Is her King not within her?" "Why have they provoked Me with their graven images, with foreign idols?"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	8	20	"Harvest is past, summer is ended, And we are not saved."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	8	21	For the brokenness of the daughter of my people I am broken; I mourn, dismay has taken hold of me.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	8	22	Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then has not the health of the daughter of my people been restored?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	9	1	Oh that my head were waters And my eyes a fountain of tears, That I might weep day and night For the slain of the daughter of my people!
Jeremiah	Jer	24	9	2	Oh that I had in the desert A wayfarers' lodging place; That I might leave my people And go from them! For all of them are adulterers, An assembly of treacherous men.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	9	3	"They bend their tongue like their bow; Lies and not truth prevail in the land; For they proceed from evil to evil, And they do not know Me," declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	9	4	"Let everyone be on guard against his neighbor, And do not trust any brother; Because every brother deals craftily, And every neighbor goes about as a slanderer.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	9	5	"Everyone deceives his neighbor And does not speak the truth, They have taught their tongue to speak lies; They weary themselves committing iniquity.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	9	6	"Your dwelling is in the midst of deceit; Through deceit they refuse to know Me," declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	9	7	Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, "Behold, I will refine them and assay them; For what else can I do, because of the daughter of My people?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	9	8	"Their tongue is a deadly arrow; It speaks deceit; With his mouth one speaks peace to his neighbor, But inwardly he sets an ambush for him.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	9	9	"Shall I not punish them for these things?" declares the LORD. "On a nation such as this Shall I not avenge Myself?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	9	10	"For the mountains I will take up a weeping and wailing, And for the pastures of the wilderness a dirge, Because they are laid waste so that no one passes through, And the lowing of the cattle is not heard; Both the birds of the sky and the beasts have fled; they are gone.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	9	11	"I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins, A haunt of jackals; And I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	9	12	Who is the wise man that may understand this? And who is he to whom the mouth of the LORD has spoken, that he may declare it? Why is the land ruined, laid waste like a desert, so that no one passes through?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	9	13	The LORD said, "Because they have forsaken My law which I set before them, and have not obeyed My voice nor walked according to it,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	9	14	but have walked after the stubbornness of their heart and after the Baals, as their fathers taught them,"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	9	15	therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "behold, I will feed them, this people, with wormwood and give them poisoned water to drink.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	9	16	"I will scatter them among the nations, whom neither they nor their fathers have known; and I will send the sword after them until I have annihilated them."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	9	17	Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Consider and call for the mourning women, that they may come; And send for the wailing women, that they may come!
Jeremiah	Jer	24	9	18	"Let them make haste and take up a wailing for us, That our eyes may shed tears And our eyelids flow with water.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	9	19	"For a voice of wailing is heard from Zion, 'How are we ruined! We are put to great shame, For we have left the land, Because they have cast down our dwellings.'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	9	20	Now hear the word of the LORD, O you women, And let your ear receive the word of His mouth; Teach your daughters wailing, And everyone her neighbor a dirge.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	9	21	For death has come up through our windows; It has entered our palaces To cut off the children from the streets, The young men from the town squares.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	9	22	Speak, "Thus says the LORD, 'The corpses of men will fall like dung on the open field, And like the sheaf after the reaper, But no one will gather them.'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	9	23	Thus says the LORD, "Let not a wise man boast of his wisdom, and let not the mighty man boast of his might, let not a rich man boast of his riches;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	9	24	but let him who boasts boast of this, that he understands and knows Me, that I am the LORD who exercises lovingkindness, justice and righteousness on earth; for I delight in these things," declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	9	25	"Behold, the days are coming," declares the LORD, "that I will punish all who are circumcised and yet uncircumcised--
Jeremiah	Jer	24	9	26	Egypt and Judah, and Edom and the sons of Ammon, and Moab and all those inhabiting the desert who clip the hair on their temples; for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised of heart."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	10	1	Hear the word which the LORD speaks to you, O house of Israel.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	10	2	Thus says the LORD, "Do not learn the way of the nations, And do not be terrified by the signs of the heavens Although the nations are terrified by them;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	10	3	For the customs of the peoples are delusion; Because it is wood cut from the forest, The work of the hands of a craftsman with a cutting tool.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	10	4	"They decorate it with silver and with gold; They fasten it with nails and with hammers So that it will not totter.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	10	5	"Like a scarecrow in a cucumber field are they, And they cannot speak; They must be carried, Because they cannot walk! Do not fear them, For they can do no harm, Nor can they do any good."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	10	6	There is none like You, O LORD; You are great, and great is Your name in might.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	10	7	Who would not fear You, O King of the nations? Indeed it is Your due! For among all the wise men of the nations And in all their kingdoms, There is none like You.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	10	8	But they are altogether stupid and foolish In their discipline of delusion--their idol is wood!
Jeremiah	Jer	24	10	9	Beaten silver is brought from Tarshish, And gold from Uphaz, The work of a craftsman and of the hands of a goldsmith; Violet and purple are their clothing; They are all the work of skilled men.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	10	10	But the LORD is the true God; He is the living God and the everlasting King. At His wrath the earth quakes, And the nations cannot endure His indignation.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	10	11	Thus you shall say to them, "The gods that did not make the heavens and the earth will perish from the earth and from under the heavens."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	10	12	It is He who made the earth by His power, Who established the world by His wisdom; And by His understanding He has stretched out the heavens.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	10	13	When He utters His voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, And He causes the clouds to ascend from the end of the earth; He makes lightning for the rain, And brings out the wind from His storehouses.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	10	14	Every man is stupid, devoid of knowledge; Every goldsmith is put to shame by his idols; For his molten images are deceitful, And there is no breath in them.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	10	15	They are worthless, a work of mockery; In the time of their punishment they will perish.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	10	16	The portion of Jacob is not like these; For the Maker of all is He, And Israel is the tribe of His inheritance; The LORD of hosts is His name.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	10	17	Pick up your bundle from the ground, You who dwell under siege!
Jeremiah	Jer	24	10	18	For thus says the LORD, "Behold, I am slinging out the inhabitants of the land At this time, And will cause them distress, That they may be found."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	10	19	Woe is me, because of my injury! My wound is incurable. But I said, "Truly this is a sickness, And I must bear it."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	10	20	My tent is destroyed, And all my ropes are broken; My sons have gone from me and are no more. There is no one to stretch out my tent again Or to set up my curtains.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	10	21	For the shepherds have become stupid And have not sought the LORD; Therefore they have not prospered, And all their flock is scattered.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	10	22	The sound of a report! Behold, it comes-- A great commotion out of the land of the north-- To make the cities of Judah A desolation, a haunt of jackals.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	10	23	I know, O LORD, that a man's way is not in himself, Nor is it in a man who walks to direct his steps.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	10	24	Correct me, O LORD, but with justice; Not with Your anger, or You will bring me to nothing.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	10	25	Pour out Your wrath on the nations that do not know You And on the families that do not call Your name; For they have devoured Jacob; They have devoured him and consumed him And have laid waste his habitation.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	11	1	The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	11	2	"Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	11	3	and say to them, 'Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, "Cursed is the man who does not heed the words of this covenant
Jeremiah	Jer	24	11	4	which I commanded your forefathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, 'Listen to My voice, and do according to all which I command you; so you shall be My people, and I will be your God,'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	11	5	in order to confirm the oath which I swore to your forefathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day."'" Then I said, "Amen, O LORD."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	11	6	And the LORD said to me, "Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, 'Hear the words of this covenant and do them.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	11	7	'For I solemnly warned your fathers in the day that I brought them up from the land of Egypt, even to this day, warning persistently, saying, "Listen to My voice."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	11	8	'Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but walked, each one, in the stubbornness of his evil heart; therefore I brought on them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did not.'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	11	9	Then the LORD said to me, "A conspiracy has been found among the men of Judah and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	11	10	"They have turned back to the iniquities of their ancestors who refused to hear My words, and they have gone after other gods to serve them; the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken My covenant which I made with their fathers."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	11	11	Therefore thus says the LORD, "Behold I am bringing disaster on them which they will not be able to escape; though they will cry to Me, yet I will not listen to them.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	11	12	"Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry to the gods to whom they burn incense, but they surely will not save them in the time of their disaster.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	11	13	"For your gods are as many as your cities, O Judah; and as many as the streets of Jerusalem are the altars you have set up to the shameful thing, altars to burn incense to Baal.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	11	14	"Therefore do not pray for this people, nor lift up a cry or prayer for them; for I will not listen when they call to Me because of their disaster.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	11	15	"What right has My beloved in My house When she has done many vile deeds? Can the sacrificial flesh take away from you your disaster, So that you can rejoice?"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	11	16	The LORD called your name, "A green olive tree, beautiful in fruit and form"; With the noise of a great tumult He has kindled fire on it, And its branches are worthless.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	11	17	The LORD of hosts, who planted you, has pronounced evil against you because of the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done to provoke Me by offering up sacrifices to Baal.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	11	18	Moreover, the LORD made it known to me and I knew it; Then You showed me their deeds.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	11	19	But I was like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter; And I did not know that they had devised plots against me, saying, "Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, And let us cut him off from the land of the living, That his name be remembered no more."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	11	20	But, O LORD of hosts, who judges righteously, Who tries the feelings and the heart, Let me see Your vengeance on them, For to You have I committed my cause.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	11	21	Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the men of Anathoth, who seek your life, saying, "Do not prophesy in the name of the LORD, so that you will not die at our hand";
Jeremiah	Jer	24	11	22	therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts, "Behold, I am about to punish them! The young men will die by the sword, their sons and daughters will die by famine;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	11	23	and a remnant will not be left to them, for I will bring disaster on the men of Anathoth--the year of their punishment."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	12	1	Righteous are You, O LORD, that I would plead my case with You; Indeed I would discuss matters of justice with You: Why has the way of the wicked prospered? Why are all those who deal in treachery at ease?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	12	2	You have planted them, they have also taken root; They grow, they have even produced fruit. You are near to their lips But far from their mind.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	12	3	But You know me, O LORD; You see me; And You examine my heart's attitude toward You. Drag them off like sheep for the slaughter And set them apart for a day of carnage!
Jeremiah	Jer	24	12	4	How long is the land to mourn And the vegetation of the countryside to wither? For the wickedness of those who dwell in it, Animals and birds have been snatched away, Because men have said, "He will not see our latter ending."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	12	5	"If you have run with footmen and they have tired you out, Then how can you compete with horses? If you fall down in a land of peace, How will you do in the thicket of the Jordan?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	12	6	"For even your brothers and the household of your father, Even they have dealt treacherously with you, Even they have cried aloud after you. Do not believe them, although they may say nice things to you."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	12	7	"I have forsaken My house, I have abandoned My inheritance; I have given the beloved of My soul Into the hand of her enemies.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	12	8	"My inheritance has become to Me Like a lion in the forest; She has roared against Me; Therefore I have come to hate her.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	12	9	"Is My inheritance like a speckled bird of prey to Me? Are the birds of prey against her on every side? Go, gather all the beasts of the field, Bring them to devour!
Jeremiah	Jer	24	12	10	"Many shepherds have ruined My vineyard, They have trampled down My field; They have made My pleasant field A desolate wilderness.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	12	11	"It has been made a desolation, Desolate, it mourns before Me; The whole land has been made desolate, Because no man lays it to heart.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	12	12	"On all the bare heights in the wilderness Destroyers have come, For a sword of the LORD is devouring From one end of the land even to the other; There is no peace for anyone.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	12	13	"They have sown wheat and have reaped thorns, They have strained themselves to no profit. But be ashamed of your harvest Because of the fierce anger of the LORD."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	12	14	Thus says the LORD concerning all My wicked neighbors who strike at the inheritance with which I have endowed My people Israel, "Behold I am about to uproot them from their land and will uproot the house of Judah from among them.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	12	15	"And it will come about that after I have uprooted them, I will again have compassion on them; and I will bring them back, each one to his inheritance and each one to his land.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	12	16	"Then if they will really learn the ways of My people, to swear by My name, 'As the LORD lives,' even as they taught My people to swear by Baal, they will be built up in the midst of My people.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	12	17	"But if they will not listen, then I will uproot that nation, uproot and destroy it," declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	13	1	Thus the LORD said to me, "Go and buy yourself a linen waistband and put it around your waist, but do not put it in water."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	13	2	So I bought the waistband in accordance with the word of the LORD and put it around my waist.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	13	3	Then the word of the LORD came to me a second time, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	13	4	"Take the waistband that you have bought, which is around your waist, and arise, go to the Euphrates and hide it there in a crevice of the rock."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	13	5	So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the LORD had commanded me.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	13	6	After many days the LORD said to me, "Arise, go to the Euphrates and take from there the waistband which I commanded you to hide there."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	13	7	Then I went to the Euphrates and dug, and I took the waistband from the place where I had hidden it; and lo, the waistband was ruined, it was totally worthless.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	13	8	Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	13	9	"Thus says the LORD, 'Just so will I destroy the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	13	10	'This wicked people, who refuse to listen to My words, who walk in the stubbornness of their hearts and have gone after other gods to serve them and to bow down to them, let them be just like this waistband which is totally worthless.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	13	11	'For as the waistband clings to the waist of a man, so I made the whole household of Israel and the whole household of Judah cling to Me,' declares the LORD, 'that they might be for Me a people, for renown, for praise and for glory; but they did not listen.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	13	12	"Therefore you are to speak this word to them, 'Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, "Every jug is to be filled with wine."' And when they say to you, 'Do we not very well know that every jug is to be filled with wine?'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	13	13	then say to them, 'Thus says the LORD, "Behold I am about to fill all the inhabitants of this land--the kings that sit for David on his throne, the priests, the prophets and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem--with drunkenness!
Jeremiah	Jer	24	13	14	"I will dash them against each other, both the fathers and the sons together," declares the LORD. "I will not show pity nor be sorry nor have compassion so as not to destroy them."'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	13	15	Listen and give heed, do not be haughty, For the LORD has spoken.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	13	16	Give glory to the LORD your God, Before He brings darkness And before your feet stumble On the dusky mountains, And while you are hoping for light He makes it into deep darkness, And turns it into gloom.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	13	17	But if you will not listen to it, My soul will sob in secret for such pride; And my eyes will bitterly weep And flow down with tears, Because the flock of the LORD has been taken captive.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	13	18	Say to the king and the queen mother, "Take a lowly seat, For your beautiful crown Has come down from your head."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	13	19	The cities of the Negev have been locked up, And there is no one to open them; All Judah has been carried into exile, Wholly carried into exile.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	13	20	"Lift up your eyes and see Those coming from the north. Where is the flock that was given you, Your beautiful sheep?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	13	21	"What will you say when He appoints over you-- And you yourself had taught them-- Former companions to be head over you? Will not pangs take hold of you Like a woman in childbirth?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	13	22	"If you say in your heart, 'Why have these things happened to me?' Because of the magnitude of your iniquity Your skirts have been removed And your heels have been exposed.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	13	23	"Can the Ethiopian change his skin Or the leopard his spots? Then you also can do good Who are accustomed to doing evil.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	13	24	"Therefore I will scatter them like drifting straw To the desert wind.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	13	25	"This is your lot, the portion measured to you From Me," declares the LORD, "Because you have forgotten Me And trusted in falsehood.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	13	26	"So I Myself have also stripped your skirts off over your face, That your shame may be seen.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	13	27	"As for your adulteries and your lustful neighings, The lewdness of your prostitution On the hills in the field, I have seen your abominations. Woe to you, O Jerusalem! How long will you remain unclean?"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	14	1	That which came as the word of the LORD to Jeremiah in regard to the drought:
Jeremiah	Jer	24	14	2	"Judah mourns And her gates languish; They sit on the ground in mourning, And the cry of Jerusalem has ascended.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	14	3	"Their nobles have sent their servants for water; They have come to the cisterns and found no water. They have returned with their vessels empty; They have been put to shame and humiliated, And they cover their heads.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	14	4	"Because the ground is cracked, For there has been no rain on the land; The farmers have been put to shame, They have covered their heads.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	14	5	"For even the doe in the field has given birth only to abandon her young, Because there is no grass.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	14	6	"The wild donkeys stand on the bare heights; They pant for air like jackals, Their eyes fail For there is no vegetation.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	14	7	"Although our iniquities testify against us, O LORD, act for Your name's sake! Truly our apostasies have been many, We have sinned against You.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	14	8	"O Hope of Israel, Its Savior in time of distress, Why are You like a stranger in the land Or like a traveler who has pitched his tent for the night?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	14	9	"Why are You like a man dismayed, Like a mighty man who cannot save? Yet You are in our midst, O LORD, And we are called by Your name; Do not forsake us!"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	14	10	Thus says the LORD to this people, "Even so they have loved to wander; they have not kept their feet in check. Therefore the LORD does not accept them; now He will remember their iniquity and call their sins to account."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	14	11	So the LORD said to me, "Do not pray for the welfare of this people.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	14	12	"When they fast, I am not going to listen to their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and grain offering, I am not going to accept them. Rather I am going to make an end of them by the sword, famine and pestilence."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	14	13	But, "Ah, Lord GOD!" I said, "Look, the prophets are telling them, 'You will not see the sword nor will you have famine, but I will give you lasting peace in this place.'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	14	14	Then the LORD said to me, "The prophets are prophesying falsehood in My name. I have neither sent them nor commanded them nor spoken to them; they are prophesying to you a false vision, divination, futility and the deception of their own minds.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	14	15	"Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the prophets who are prophesying in My name, although it was not I who sent them--yet they keep saying, 'There will be no sword or famine in this land'--by sword and famine those prophets shall meet their end!
Jeremiah	Jer	24	14	16	"The people also to whom they are prophesying will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and there will be no one to bury them--neither them, nor their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters--for I will pour out their own wickedness on them.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	14	17	"You will say this word to them, 'Let my eyes flow down with tears night and day, And let them not cease; For the virgin daughter of my people has been crushed with a mighty blow, With a sorely infected wound.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	14	18	'If I go out to the country, Behold, those slain with the sword! Or if I enter the city, Behold, diseases of famine! For both prophet and priest Have gone roving about in the land that they do not know.'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	14	19	Have You completely rejected Judah? Or have You loathed Zion? Why have You stricken us so that we are beyond healing? We waited for peace, but nothing good came; And for a time of healing, but behold, terror!
Jeremiah	Jer	24	14	20	We know our wickedness, O LORD, The iniquity of our fathers, for we have sinned against You.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	14	21	Do not despise us, for Your own name's sake; Do not disgrace the throne of Your glory; Remember and do not annul Your covenant with us.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	14	22	Are there any among the idols of the nations who give rain? Or can the heavens grant showers? Is it not You, O LORD our God? Therefore we hope in You, For You are the one who has done all these things.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	15	1	Then the LORD said to me, "Even though Moses and Samuel were to stand before Me, My heart would not be with this people; send them away from My presence and let them go!
Jeremiah	Jer	24	15	2	"And it shall be that when they say to you, 'Where should we go?' then you are to tell them, 'Thus says the LORD: "Those destined for death, to death; And those destined for the sword, to the sword; And those destined for famine, to famine; And those destined for captivity, to captivity."'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	15	3	"I will appoint over them four kinds of doom," declares the LORD: "the sword to slay, the dogs to drag off, and the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	15	4	"I will make them an object of horror among all the kingdoms of the earth because of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, the king of Judah, for what he did in Jerusalem.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	15	5	"Indeed, who will have pity on you, O Jerusalem, Or who will mourn for you, Or who will turn aside to ask about your welfare?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	15	6	"You who have forsaken Me," declares the LORD, "You keep going backward. So I will stretch out My hand against you and destroy you; I am tired of relenting!
Jeremiah	Jer	24	15	7	"I will winnow them with a winnowing fork At the gates of the land; I will bereave them of children, I will destroy My people; They did not repent of their ways.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	15	8	"Their widows will be more numerous before Me Than the sand of the seas; I will bring against them, against the mother of a young man, A destroyer at noonday; I will suddenly bring down on her Anguish and dismay.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	15	9	"She who bore seven sons pines away; Her breathing is labored. Her sun has set while it was yet day; She has been shamed and humiliated. So I will give over their survivors to the sword Before their enemies," declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	15	10	Woe to me, my mother, that you have borne me As a man of strife and a man of contention to all the land! I have not lent, nor have men lent money to me, Yet everyone curses me.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	15	11	The LORD said, "Surely I will set you free for purposes of good; Surely I will cause the enemy to make supplication to you In a time of disaster and a time of distress.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	15	12	"Can anyone smash iron, Iron from the north, or bronze?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	15	13	"Your wealth and your treasures I will give for booty without cost, Even for all your sins And within all your borders.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	15	14	"Then I will cause your enemies to bring it Into a land you do not know; For a fire has been kindled in My anger, It will burn upon you."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	15	15	You who know, O LORD, Remember me, take notice of me, And take vengeance for me on my persecutors. Do not, in view of Your patience, take me away; Know that for Your sake I endure reproach.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	15	16	Your words were found and I ate them, And Your words became for me a joy and the delight of my heart; For I have been called by Your name, O LORD God of hosts.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	15	17	I did not sit in the circle of merrymakers, Nor did I exult. Because of Your hand upon me I sat alone, For You filled me with indignation.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	15	18	Why has my pain been perpetual And my wound incurable, refusing to be healed? Will You indeed be to me like a deceptive stream With water that is unreliable?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	15	19	Therefore, thus says the LORD, "If you return, then I will restore you-- Before Me you will stand; And if you extract the precious from the worthless, You will become My spokesman. They for their part may turn to you, But as for you, you must not turn to them.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	15	20	"Then I will make you to this people A fortified wall of bronze; And though they fight against you, They will not prevail over you; For I am with you to save you And deliver you," declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	15	21	"So I will deliver you from the hand of the wicked, And I will redeem you from the grasp of the violent."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	16	1	The word of the LORD also came to me saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	16	2	"You shall not take a wife for yourself nor have sons or daughters in this place."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	16	3	For thus says the LORD concerning the sons and daughters born in this place, and concerning their mothers who bear them, and their fathers who beget them in this land:
Jeremiah	Jer	24	16	4	"They will die of deadly diseases, they will not be lamented or buried; they will be as dung on the surface of the ground and come to an end by sword and famine, and their carcasses will become food for the birds of the sky and for the beasts of the earth."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	16	5	For thus says the LORD, "Do not enter a house of mourning, or go to lament or to console them; for I have withdrawn My peace from this people," declares the LORD, "My lovingkindness and compassion.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	16	6	"Both great men and small will die in this land; they will not be buried, they will not be lamented, nor will anyone gash himself or shave his head for them.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	16	7	"Men will not break bread in mourning for them, to comfort anyone for the dead, nor give them a cup of consolation to drink for anyone's father or mother.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	16	8	"Moreover you shall not go into a house of feasting to sit with them to eat and drink."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	16	9	For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: "Behold, I am going to eliminate from this place, before your eyes and in your time, the voice of rejoicing and the voice of gladness, the voice of the groom and the voice of the bride.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	16	10	"Now when you tell this people all these words, they will say to you, 'For what reason has the LORD declared all this great calamity against us? And what is our iniquity, or what is our sin which we have committed against the LORD our God?'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	16	11	"Then you are to say to them, 'It is because your forefathers have forsaken Me,' declares the LORD, 'and have followed other gods and served them and bowed down to them; but Me they have forsaken and have not kept My law.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	16	12	'You too have done evil, even more than your forefathers; for behold, you are each one walking according to the stubbornness of his own evil heart, without listening to Me.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	16	13	'So I will hurl you out of this land into the land which you have not known, neither you nor your fathers; and there you will serve other gods day and night, for I will grant you no favor.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	16	14	"Therefore behold, days are coming," declares the LORD, "when it will no longer be said, 'As the LORD lives, who brought up the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt,'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	16	15	but, 'As the LORD lives, who brought up the sons of Israel from the land of the north and from all the countries where He had banished them.' For I will restore them to their own land which I gave to their fathers.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	16	16	"Behold, I am going to send for many fishermen," declares the LORD, "and they will fish for them; and afterwards I will send for many hunters, and they will hunt them from every mountain and every hill and from the clefts of the rocks.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	16	17	"For My eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from My face, nor is their iniquity concealed from My eyes.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	16	18	"I will first doubly repay their iniquity and their sin, because they have polluted My land; they have filled My inheritance with the carcasses of their detestable idols and with their abominations."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	16	19	O LORD, my strength and my stronghold, And my refuge in the day of distress, To You the nations will come From the ends of the earth and say, "Our fathers have inherited nothing but falsehood, Futility and things of no profit."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	16	20	Can man make gods for himself? Yet they are not gods!
Jeremiah	Jer	24	16	21	"Therefore behold, I am going to make them know-- This time I will make them know My power and My might; And they shall know that My name is the LORD."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	17	1	The sin of Judah is written down with an iron stylus; With a diamond point it is engraved upon the tablet of their heart And on the horns of their altars,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	17	2	As they remember their children, So they remember their altars and their Asherim By green trees on the high hills.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	17	3	O mountain of Mine in the countryside, I will give over your wealth and all your treasures for booty, Your high places for sin throughout your borders.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	17	4	And you will, even of yourself, let go of your inheritance That I gave you; And I will make you serve your enemies In the land which you do not know; For you have kindled a fire in My anger Which will burn forever.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	17	5	Thus says the LORD, "Cursed is the man who trusts in mankind And makes flesh his strength, And whose heart turns away from the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	17	6	"For he will be like a bush in the desert And will not see when prosperity comes, But will live in stony wastes in the wilderness, A land of salt without inhabitant.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	17	7	"Blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD And whose trust is the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	17	8	"For he will be like a tree planted by the water, That extends its roots by a stream And will not fear when the heat comes; But its leaves will be green, And it will not be anxious in a year of drought Nor cease to yield fruit.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	17	9	"The heart is more deceitful than all else And is desperately sick; Who can understand it?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	17	10	"I, the LORD, search the heart, I test the mind, Even to give to each man according to his ways, According to the results of his deeds.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	17	11	"As a partridge that hatches eggs which it has not laid, So is he who makes a fortune, but unjustly; In the midst of his days it will forsake him, And in the end he will be a fool."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	17	12	A glorious throne on high from the beginning Is the place of our sanctuary.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	17	13	O LORD, the hope of Israel, All who forsake You will be put to shame. Those who turn away on earth will be written down, Because they have forsaken the fountain of living water, even the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	17	14	Heal me, O LORD, and I will be healed; Save me and I will be saved, For You are my praise.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	17	15	Look, they keep saying to me, "Where is the word of the LORD? Let it come now!"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	17	16	But as for me, I have not hurried away from being a shepherd after You, Nor have I longed for the woeful day; You Yourself know that the utterance of my lips Was in Your presence.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	17	17	Do not be a terror to me; You are my refuge in the day of disaster.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	17	18	Let those who persecute me be put to shame, but as for me, let me not be put to shame; Let them be dismayed, but let me not be dismayed. Bring on them a day of disaster, And crush them with twofold destruction!
Jeremiah	Jer	24	17	19	Thus the LORD said to me, "Go and stand in the public gate, through which the kings of Judah come in and go out, as well as in all the gates of Jerusalem;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	17	20	and say to them, 'Listen to the word of the LORD, kings of Judah, and all Judah and all inhabitants of Jerusalem who come in through these gates:
Jeremiah	Jer	24	17	21	'Thus says the LORD, "Take heed for yourselves, and do not carry any load on the sabbath day or bring anything in through the gates of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	17	22	"You shall not bring a load out of your houses on the sabbath day nor do any work, but keep the sabbath day holy, as I commanded your forefathers.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	17	23	"Yet they did not listen or incline their ears, but stiffened their necks in order not to listen or take correction.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	17	24	"But it will come about, if you listen attentively to Me," declares the LORD, "to bring no load in through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but to keep the sabbath day holy by doing no work on it,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	17	25	then there will come in through the gates of this city kings and princes sitting on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they and their princes, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and this city will be inhabited forever.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	17	26	"They will come in from the cities of Judah and from the environs of Jerusalem, from the land of Benjamin, from the lowland, from the hill country and from the Negev, bringing burnt offerings, sacrifices, grain offerings and incense, and bringing sacrifices of thanksgiving to the house of the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	17	27	"But if you do not listen to Me to keep the sabbath day holy by not carrying a load and coming in through the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day, then I will kindle a fire in its gates and it will devour the palaces of Jerusalem and not be quenched."'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	18	1	The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	18	2	"Arise and go down to the potter's house, and there I will announce My words to you."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	18	3	Then I went down to the potter's house, and there he was, making something on the wheel.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	18	4	But the vessel that he was making of clay was spoiled in the hand of the potter; so he remade it into another vessel, as it pleased the potter to make.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	18	5	Then the word of the LORD came to me saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	18	6	"Can I not, O house of Israel, deal with you as this potter does?" declares the LORD. "Behold, like the clay in the potter's hand, so are you in My hand, O house of Israel.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	18	7	"At one moment I might speak concerning a nation or concerning a kingdom to uproot, to pull down, or to destroy it;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	18	8	if that nation against which I have spoken turns from its evil, I will relent concerning the calamity I planned to bring on it.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	18	9	"Or at another moment I might speak concerning a nation or concerning a kingdom to build up or to plant it;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	18	10	if it does evil in My sight by not obeying My voice, then I will think better of the good with which I had promised to bless it.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	18	11	"So now then, speak to the men of Judah and against the inhabitants of Jerusalem saying, 'Thus says the LORD, "Behold, I am fashioning calamity against you and devising a plan against you. Oh turn back, each of you from his evil way, and reform your ways and your deeds."'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	18	12	"But they will say, 'It's hopeless! For we are going to follow our own plans, and each of us will act according to the stubbornness of his evil heart.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	18	13	"Therefore thus says the LORD, 'Ask now among the nations, Who ever heard the like of this? The virgin of Israel Has done a most appalling thing.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	18	14	'Does the snow of Lebanon forsake the rock of the open country? Or is the cold flowing water from a foreign land ever snatched away?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	18	15	'For My people have forgotten Me, They burn incense to worthless gods And they have stumbled from their ways, From the ancient paths, To walk in bypaths, Not on a highway,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	18	16	To make their land a desolation, An object of perpetual hissing; Everyone who passes by it will be astonished And shake his head.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	18	17	'Like an east wind I will scatter them Before the enemy; I will show them My back and not My face In the day of their calamity.'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	18	18	Then they said, "Come and let us devise plans against Jeremiah. Surely the law is not going to be lost to the priest, nor counsel to the sage, nor the divine word to the prophet! Come on and let us strike at him with our tongue, and let us give no heed to any of his words."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	18	19	Do give heed to me, O LORD, And listen to what my opponents are saying!
Jeremiah	Jer	24	18	20	Should good be repaid with evil? For they have dug a pit for me. Remember how I stood before You To speak good on their behalf, So as to turn away Your wrath from them.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	18	21	Therefore, give their children over to famine And deliver them up to the power of the sword; And let their wives become childless and widowed. Let their men also be smitten to death, Their young men struck down by the sword in battle.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	18	22	May an outcry be heard from their houses, When You suddenly bring raiders upon them; For they have dug a pit to capture me And hidden snares for my feet.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	18	23	Yet You, O LORD, know All their deadly designs against me; Do not forgive their iniquity Or blot out their sin from Your sight. But may they be overthrown before You; Deal with them in the time of Your anger!
Jeremiah	Jer	24	19	1	Thus says the LORD, "Go and buy a potter's earthenware jar, and take some of the elders of the people and some of the senior priests.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	19	2	"Then go out to the valley of Ben-hinnom, which is by the entrance of the potsherd gate, and proclaim there the words that I tell you,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	19	3	and say, 'Hear the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "Behold I am about to bring a calamity upon this place, at which the ears of everyone that hears of it will tingle.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	19	4	"Because they have forsaken Me and have made this an alien place and have burned sacrifices in it to other gods, that neither they nor their forefathers nor the kings of Judah had ever known, and because they have filled this place with the blood of the innocent
Jeremiah	Jer	24	19	5	and have built the high places of Baal to burn their sons in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal, a thing which I never commanded or spoke of, nor did it ever enter My mind;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	19	6	therefore, behold, days are coming," declares the LORD, "when this place will no longer be called Topheth or the valley of Ben-hinnom, but rather the valley of Slaughter.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	19	7	"I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place, and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies and by the hand of those who seek their life; and I will give over their carcasses as food for the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	19	8	"I will also make this city a desolation and an object of hissing; everyone who passes by it will be astonished and hiss because of all its disasters.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	19	9	"I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they will eat one another's flesh in the siege and in the distress with which their enemies and those who seek their life will distress them."'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	19	10	"Then you are to break the jar in the sight of the men who accompany you
Jeremiah	Jer	24	19	11	and say to them, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Just so will I break this people and this city, even as one breaks a potter's vessel, which cannot again be repaired; and they will bury in Topheth because there is no other place for burial.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	19	12	"This is how I will treat this place and its inhabitants," declares the LORD, "so as to make this city like Topheth.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	19	13	"The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah will be defiled like the place Topheth, because of all the houses on whose rooftops they burned sacrifices to all the heavenly host and poured out drink offerings to other gods."'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	19	14	Then Jeremiah came from Topheth, where the LORD had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of the LORD'S house and said to all the people:
Jeremiah	Jer	24	19	15	"Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, 'Behold, I am about to bring on this city and all its towns the entire calamity that I have declared against it, because they have stiffened their necks so as not to heed My words.'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	20	1	When Pashhur the priest, the son of Immer, who was chief officer in the house of the LORD, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	20	2	Pashhur had Jeremiah the prophet beaten and put him in the stocks that were at the upper Benjamin Gate, which was by the house of the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	20	3	On the next day, when Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, "Pashhur is not the name the LORD has called you, but rather Magor-missabib.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	20	4	"For thus says the LORD, 'Behold, I am going to make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends; and while your eyes look on, they will fall by the sword of their enemies. So I will give over all Judah to the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will carry them away as exiles to Babylon and will slay them with the sword.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	20	5	'I will also give over all the wealth of this city, all its produce and all its costly things; even all the treasures of the kings of Judah I will give over to the hand of their enemies, and they will plunder them, take them away and bring them to Babylon.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	20	6	'And you, Pashhur, and all who live in your house will go into captivity; and you will enter Babylon, and there you will die and there you will be buried, you and all your friends to whom you have falsely prophesied.'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	20	7	O LORD, You have deceived me and I was deceived; You have overcome me and prevailed. I have become a laughingstock all day long; Everyone mocks me.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	20	8	For each time I speak, I cry aloud; I proclaim violence and destruction, Because for me the word of the LORD has resulted In reproach and derision all day long.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	20	9	But if I say, "I will not remember Him Or speak anymore in His name," Then in my heart it becomes like a burning fire Shut up in my bones; And I am weary of holding it in, And I cannot endure it.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	20	10	For I have heard the whispering of many, "Terror on every side! Denounce him; yes, let us denounce him!" All my trusted friends, Watching for my fall, say: "Perhaps he will be deceived, so that we may prevail against him And take our revenge on him."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	20	11	But the LORD is with me like a dread champion; Therefore my persecutors will stumble and not prevail. They will be utterly ashamed, because they have failed, With an everlasting disgrace that will not be forgotten.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	20	12	Yet, O LORD of hosts, You who test the righteous, Who see the mind and the heart; Let me see Your vengeance on them; For to You I have set forth my cause.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	20	13	Sing to the LORD, praise the LORD! For He has delivered the soul of the needy one From the hand of evildoers.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	20	14	Cursed be the day when I was born; Let the day not be blessed when my mother bore me!
Jeremiah	Jer	24	20	15	Cursed be the man who brought the news To my father, saying, "A baby boy has been born to you!" And made him very happy.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	20	16	But let that man be like the cities Which the LORD overthrew without relenting, And let him hear an outcry in the morning And a shout of alarm at noon;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	20	17	Because he did not kill me before birth, So that my mother would have been my grave, And her womb ever pregnant.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	20	18	Why did I ever come forth from the womb To look on trouble and sorrow, So that my days have been spent in shame?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	21	1	The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur the son of Malchijah, and Zephaniah the priest, the son of Maaseiah, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	21	2	"Please inquire of the LORD on our behalf, for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is warring against us; perhaps the LORD will deal with us according to all His wonderful acts, so that the enemy will withdraw from us."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	21	3	Then Jeremiah said to them, "You shall say to Zedekiah as follows:
Jeremiah	Jer	24	21	4	'Thus says the LORD God of Israel, "Behold, I am about to turn back the weapons of war which are in your hands, with which you are warring against the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans who are besieging you outside the wall; and I will gather them into the center of this city.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	21	5	"I Myself will war against you with an outstretched hand and a mighty arm, even in anger and wrath and great indignation.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	21	6	"I will also strike down the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast; they will die of a great pestilence.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	21	7	"Then afterwards," declares the LORD, "I will give over Zedekiah king of Judah and his servants and the people, even those who survive in this city from the pestilence, the sword and the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their foes and into the hand of those who seek their lives; and he will strike them down with the edge of the sword. He will not spare them nor have pity nor compassion."'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	21	8	"You shall also say to this people, 'Thus says the LORD, "Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	21	9	"He who dwells in this city will die by the sword and by famine and by pestilence; but he who goes out and falls away to the Chaldeans who are besieging you will live, and he will have his own life as booty.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	21	10	"For I have set My face against this city for harm and not for good," declares the LORD. "It will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon and he will burn it with fire."'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	21	11	"Then say to the household of the king of Judah, 'Hear the word of the LORD,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	21	12	O house of David, thus says the LORD: "Administer justice every morning; And deliver the person who has been robbed from the power of his oppressor, That My wrath may not go forth like fire And burn with none to extinguish it, Because of the evil of their deeds.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	21	13	"Behold, I am against you, O valley dweller, O rocky plain," declares the LORD, "You men who say, 'Who will come down against us? Or who will enter into our habitations?'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	21	14	"But I will punish you according to the results of your deeds," declares the LORD, "And I will kindle a fire in its forest That it may devour all its environs."'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	22	1	Thus says the LORD, "Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and there speak this word
Jeremiah	Jer	24	22	2	and say, 'Hear the word of the LORD, O king of Judah, who sits on David's throne, you and your servants and your people who enter these gates.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	22	3	'Thus says the LORD, "Do justice and righteousness, and deliver the one who has been robbed from the power of his oppressor. Also do not mistreat or do violence to the stranger, the orphan, or the widow; and do not shed innocent blood in this place.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	22	4	"For if you men will indeed perform this thing, then kings will enter the gates of this house, sitting in David's place on his throne, riding in chariots and on horses, even the king himself and his servants and his people.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	22	5	"But if you will not obey these words, I swear by Myself," declares the LORD, "that this house will become a desolation."'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	22	6	For thus says the LORD concerning the house of the king of Judah: "You are like Gilead to Me, Like the summit of Lebanon; Yet most assuredly I will make you like a wilderness, Like cities which are not inhabited.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	22	7	"For I will set apart destroyers against you, Each with his weapons; And they will cut down your choicest cedars And throw them on the fire.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	22	8	"Many nations will pass by this city; and they will say to one another, 'Why has the LORD done thus to this great city?'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	22	9	"Then they will answer, 'Because they forsook the covenant of the LORD their God and bowed down to other gods and served them.'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	22	10	Do not weep for the dead or mourn for him, But weep continually for the one who goes away; For he will never return Or see his native land.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	22	11	For thus says the LORD in regard to Shallum the son of Josiah, king of Judah, who became king in the place of Josiah his father, who went forth from this place, "He will never return there;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	22	12	but in the place where they led him captive, there he will die and not see this land again.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	22	13	"Woe to him who builds his house without righteousness And his upper rooms without justice, Who uses his neighbor's services without pay And does not give him his wages,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	22	14	Who says, 'I will build myself a roomy house With spacious upper rooms, And cut out its windows, Paneling it with cedar and painting it bright red.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	22	15	"Do you become a king because you are competing in cedar? Did not your father eat and drink And do justice and righteousness? Then it was well with him.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	22	16	"He pled the cause of the afflicted and needy; Then it was well. Is not that what it means to know Me?" Declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	22	17	"But your eyes and your heart Are intent only upon your own dishonest gain, And on shedding innocent blood And on practicing oppression and extortion."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	22	18	Therefore thus says the LORD in regard to Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, "They will not lament for him: 'Alas, my brother!' or, 'Alas, sister!' They will not lament for him: 'Alas for the master!' or, 'Alas for his splendor!'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	22	19	"He will be buried with a donkey's burial, Dragged off and thrown out beyond the gates of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	22	20	"Go up to Lebanon and cry out, And lift up your voice in Bashan; Cry out also from Abarim, For all your lovers have been crushed.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	22	21	"I spoke to you in your prosperity; But you said, 'I will not listen!' This has been your practice from your youth, That you have not obeyed My voice.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	22	22	"The wind will sweep away all your shepherds, And your lovers will go into captivity; Then you will surely be ashamed and humiliated Because of all your wickedness.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	22	23	"You who dwell in Lebanon, Nested in the cedars, How you will groan when pangs come upon you, Pain like a woman in childbirth!
Jeremiah	Jer	24	22	24	"As I live," declares the LORD, "even though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were a signet ring on My right hand, yet I would pull you off;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	22	25	and I will give you over into the hand of those who are seeking your life, yes, into the hand of those whom you dread, even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of the Chaldeans.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	22	26	"I will hurl you and your mother who bore you into another country where you were not born, and there you will die.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	22	27	"But as for the land to which they desire to return, they will not return to it.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	22	28	"Is this man Coniah a despised, shattered jar? Or is he an undesirable vessel? Why have he and his descendants been hurled out And cast into a land that they had not known?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	22	29	"O land, land, land, Hear the word of the LORD!
Jeremiah	Jer	24	22	30	"Thus says the LORD, 'Write this man down childless, A man who will not prosper in his days; For no man of his descendants will prosper Sitting on the throne of David Or ruling again in Judah.'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	1	"Woe to the shepherds who are destroying and scattering the sheep of My pasture!" declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	2	Therefore thus says the LORD God of Israel concerning the shepherds who are tending My people: "You have scattered My flock and driven them away, and have not attended to them; behold, I am about to attend to you for the evil of your deeds," declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	3	"Then I Myself will gather the remnant of My flock out of all the countries where I have driven them and bring them back to their pasture, and they will be fruitful and multiply.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	4	"I will also raise up shepherds over them and they will tend them; and they will not be afraid any longer, nor be terrified, nor will any be missing," declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	5	"Behold, the days are coming," declares the LORD, "When I will raise up for David a righteous Branch; And He will reign as king and act wisely And do justice and righteousness in the land.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	6	"In His days Judah will be saved, And Israel will dwell securely; And this is His name by which He will be called, 'The LORD our righteousness.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	7	"Therefore behold, the days are coming," declares the LORD, "when they will no longer say, 'As the LORD lives, who brought up the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt,'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	8	but, 'As the LORD lives, who brought up and led back the descendants of the household of Israel from the north land and from all the countries where I had driven them.' Then they will live on their own soil."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	9	As for the prophets: My heart is broken within me, All my bones tremble; I have become like a drunken man, Even like a man overcome with wine, Because of the LORD And because of His holy words.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	10	For the land is full of adulterers; For the land mourns because of the curse. The pastures of the wilderness have dried up. Their course also is evil And their might is not right.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	11	"For both prophet and priest are polluted; Even in My house I have found their wickedness," declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	12	"Therefore their way will be like slippery paths to them, They will be driven away into the gloom and fall down in it; For I will bring calamity upon them, The year of their punishment," declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	13	"Moreover, among the prophets of Samaria I saw an offensive thing: They prophesied by Baal and led My people Israel astray.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	14	"Also among the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible thing: The committing of adultery and walking in falsehood; And they strengthen the hands of evildoers, So that no one has turned back from his wickedness. All of them have become to Me like Sodom, And her inhabitants like Gomorrah.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	15	"Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets, 'Behold, I am going to feed them wormwood And make them drink poisonous water, For from the prophets of Jerusalem Pollution has gone forth into all the land.'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	16	Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are prophesying to you. They are leading you into futility; They speak a vision of their own imagination, Not from the mouth of the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	17	"They keep saying to those who despise Me, 'The LORD has said, "You will have peace"'; And as for everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own heart, They say, 'Calamity will not come upon you.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	18	"But who has stood in the council of the LORD, That he should see and hear His word? Who has given heed to His word and listened?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	19	"Behold, the storm of the LORD has gone forth in wrath, Even a whirling tempest; It will swirl down on the head of the wicked.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	20	"The anger of the LORD will not turn back Until He has performed and carried out the purposes of His heart; In the last days you will clearly understand it.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	21	"I did not send these prophets, But they ran. I did not speak to them, But they prophesied.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	22	"But if they had stood in My council, Then they would have announced My words to My people, And would have turned them back from their evil way And from the evil of their deeds.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	23	"Am I a God who is near," declares the LORD, "And not a God far off?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	24	"Can a man hide himself in hiding places So I do not see him?" declares the LORD. "Do I not fill the heavens and the earth?" declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	25	"I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy falsely in My name, saying, 'I had a dream, I had a dream!'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	26	"How long? Is there anything in the hearts of the prophets who prophesy falsehood, even these prophets of the deception of their own heart,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	27	who intend to make My people forget My name by their dreams which they relate to one another, just as their fathers forgot My name because of Baal?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	28	"The prophet who has a dream may relate his dream, but let him who has My word speak My word in truth. What does straw have in common with grain?" declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	29	"Is not My word like fire?" declares the LORD, "and like a hammer which shatters a rock?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	30	"Therefore behold, I am against the prophets," declares the LORD, "who steal My words from each other.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	31	"Behold, I am against the prophets," declares the LORD, "who use their tongues and declare, 'The Lord declares.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	32	"Behold, I am against those who have prophesied false dreams," declares the LORD, "and related them and led My people astray by their falsehoods and reckless boasting; yet I did not send them or command them, nor do they furnish this people the slightest benefit," declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	33	"Now when this people or the prophet or a priest asks you saying, 'What is the oracle of the LORD?' then you shall say to them, 'What oracle?' The LORD declares, 'I will abandon you.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	34	"Then as for the prophet or the priest or the people who say, 'The oracle of the LORD,' I will bring punishment upon that man and his household.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	35	"Thus will each of you say to his neighbor and to his brother, 'What has the LORD answered?' or, 'What has the LORD spoken?'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	36	"For you will no longer remember the oracle of the LORD, because every man's own word will become the oracle, and you have perverted the words of the living God, the LORD of hosts, our God.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	37	"Thus you will say to that prophet, 'What has the LORD answered you?' and, 'What has the LORD spoken?'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	38	"For if you say, 'The oracle of the LORD!' surely thus says the LORD, 'Because you said this word, "The oracle of the LORD!" I have also sent to you, saying, "You shall not say, 'The oracle of the LORD!'"'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	39	"Therefore behold, I will surely forget you and cast you away from My presence, along with the city which I gave you and your fathers.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	23	40	"I will put an everlasting reproach on you and an everlasting humiliation which will not be forgotten."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	24	1	After Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the officials of Judah with the craftsmen and smiths from Jerusalem and had brought them to Babylon, the LORD showed me: behold, two baskets of figs set before the temple of the LORD!
Jeremiah	Jer	24	24	2	One basket had very good figs, like first-ripe figs, and the other basket had very bad figs which could not be eaten due to rottenness.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	24	3	Then the LORD said to me, "What do you see, Jeremiah?" And I said, "Figs, the good figs, very good; and the bad figs, very bad, which cannot be eaten due to rottenness."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	24	4	Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	24	5	"Thus says the LORD God of Israel, 'Like these good figs, so I will regard as good the captives of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	24	6	'For I will set My eyes on them for good, and I will bring them again to this land; and I will build them up and not overthrow them, and I will plant them and not pluck them up.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	24	7	'I will give them a heart to know Me, for I am the LORD; and they will be My people, and I will be their God, for they will return to Me with their whole heart.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	24	8	'But like the bad figs which cannot be eaten due to rottenness--indeed, thus says the LORD--so I will abandon Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials, and the remnant of Jerusalem who remain in this land and the ones who dwell in the land of Egypt.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	24	9	'I will make them a terror and an evil for all the kingdoms of the earth, as a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse in all places where I will scatter them.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	24	10	'I will send the sword, the famine and the pestilence upon them until they are destroyed from the land which I gave to them and their forefathers.'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	1	The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (that was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon),
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	2	which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	3	"From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, even to this day, these twenty-three years the word of the LORD has come to me, and I have spoken to you again and again, but you have not listened.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	4	"And the LORD has sent to you all His servants the prophets again and again, but you have not listened nor inclined your ear to hear,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	5	saying, 'Turn now everyone from his evil way and from the evil of your deeds, and dwell on the land which the LORD has given to you and your forefathers forever and ever;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	6	and do not go after other gods to serve them and to worship them, and do not provoke Me to anger with the work of your hands, and I will do you no harm.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	7	"Yet you have not listened to Me," declares the LORD, "in order that you might provoke Me to anger with the work of your hands to your own harm.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	8	"Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Because you have not obeyed My words,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	9	behold, I will send and take all the families of the north,' declares the LORD, 'and I will send to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, My servant, and will bring them against this land and against its inhabitants and against all these nations round about; and I will utterly destroy them and make them a horror and a hissing, and an everlasting desolation.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	10	'Moreover, I will take from them the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones and the light of the lamp.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	11	'This whole land will be a desolation and a horror, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	12	'Then it will be when seventy years are completed I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation,' declares the LORD, 'for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans; and I will make it an everlasting desolation.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	13	'I will bring upon that land all My words which I have pronounced against it, all that is written in this book which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	14	'(For many nations and great kings will make slaves of them, even them; and I will recompense them according to their deeds and according to the work of their hands.)'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	15	For thus the LORD, the God of Israel, says to me, "Take this cup of the wine of wrath from My hand and cause all the nations to whom I send you to drink it.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	16	"They will drink and stagger and go mad because of the sword that I will send among them."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	17	Then I took the cup from the LORD'S hand and made all the nations to whom the LORD sent me drink it:
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	18	Jerusalem and the cities of Judah and its kings and its princes, to make them a ruin, a horror, a hissing and a curse, as it is this day;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	19	Pharaoh king of Egypt, his servants, his princes and all his people;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	20	and all the foreign people, all the kings of the land of Uz, all the kings of the land of the Philistines (even Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron and the remnant of Ashdod);
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	21	Edom, Moab and the sons of Ammon;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	22	and all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon and the kings of the coastlands which are beyond the sea;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	23	and Dedan, Tema, Buz and all who cut the corners of their hair;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	24	and all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the foreign people who dwell in the desert;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	25	and all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam and all the kings of Media;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	26	and all the kings of the north, near and far, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the earth which are upon the face of the ground, and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	27	"You shall say to them, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "Drink, be drunk, vomit, fall and rise no more because of the sword which I will send among you."'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	28	"And it will be, if they refuse to take the cup from your hand to drink, then you will say to them, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts: "You shall surely drink!
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	29	"For behold, I am beginning to work calamity in this city which is called by My name, and shall you be completely free from punishment? You will not be free from punishment; for I am summoning a sword against all the inhabitants of the earth," declares the LORD of hosts.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	30	"Therefore you shall prophesy against them all these words, and you shall say to them, 'The LORD will roar from on high And utter His voice from His holy habitation; He will roar mightily against His fold. He will shout like those who tread the grapes, Against all the inhabitants of the earth.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	31	'A clamor has come to the end of the earth, Because the LORD has a controversy with the nations. He is entering into judgment with all flesh; As for the wicked, He has given them to the sword,' declares the LORD."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	32	Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Behold, evil is going forth From nation to nation, And a great storm is being stirred up From the remotest parts of the earth.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	33	"Those slain by the LORD on that day will be from one end of the earth to the other. They will not be lamented, gathered or buried; they will be like dung on the face of the ground.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	34	"Wail, you shepherds, and cry; And wallow in ashes, you masters of the flock; For the days of your slaughter and your dispersions have come, And you will fall like a choice vessel.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	35	"Flight will perish from the shepherds, And escape from the masters of the flock.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	36	"Hear the sound of the cry of the shepherds, And the wailing of the masters of the flock! For the LORD is destroying their pasture,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	37	"And the peaceful folds are made silent Because of the fierce anger of the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	25	38	"He has left His hiding place like the lion; For their land has become a horror Because of the fierceness of the oppressing sword And because of His fierce anger."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	26	1	In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came from the LORD, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	26	2	"Thus says the LORD, 'Stand in the court of the LORD'S house, and speak to all the cities of Judah who have come to worship in the LORD'S house all the words that I have commanded you to speak to them. Do not omit a word!
Jeremiah	Jer	24	26	3	'Perhaps they will listen and everyone will turn from his evil way, that I may repent of the calamity which I am planning to do to them because of the evil of their deeds.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	26	4	"And you will say to them, 'Thus says the LORD, "If you will not listen to Me, to walk in My law which I have set before you,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	26	5	to listen to the words of My servants the prophets, whom I have been sending to you again and again, but you have not listened;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	26	6	then I will make this house like Shiloh, and this city I will make a curse to all the nations of the earth."'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	26	7	The priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	26	8	When Jeremiah finished speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak to all the people, the priests and the prophets and all the people seized him, saying, "You must die!
Jeremiah	Jer	24	26	9	"Why have you prophesied in the name of the LORD saying, 'This house will be like Shiloh and this city will be desolate, without inhabitant'?" And all the people gathered about Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	26	10	When the officials of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king's house to the house of the LORD and sat in the entrance of the New Gate of the LORD'S house.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	26	11	Then the priests and the prophets spoke to the officials and to all the people, saying, "A death sentence for this man! For he has prophesied against this city as you have heard in your hearing."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	26	12	Then Jeremiah spoke to all the officials and to all the people, saying, "The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	26	13	"Now therefore amend your ways and your deeds and obey the voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD will change His mind about the misfortune which He has pronounced against you.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	26	14	"But as for me, behold, I am in your hands; do with me as is good and right in your sight.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	26	15	"Only know for certain that if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood on yourselves, and on this city and on its inhabitants; for truly the LORD has sent me to you to speak all these words in your hearing."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	26	16	Then the officials and all the people said to the priests and to the prophets, "No death sentence for this man! For he has spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	26	17	Then some of the elders of the land rose up and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	26	18	"Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah; and he spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, 'Thus the LORD of hosts has said, "Zion will be plowed as a field, And Jerusalem will become ruins, And the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest."'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	26	19	"Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? Did he not fear the LORD and entreat the favor of the LORD, and the LORD changed His mind about the misfortune which He had pronounced against them? But we are committing a great evil against ourselves."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	26	20	Indeed, there was also a man who prophesied in the name of the LORD, Uriah the son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim; and he prophesied against this city and against this land words similar to all those of Jeremiah.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	26	21	When King Jehoiakim and all his mighty men and all the officials heard his words, then the king sought to put him to death; but Uriah heard it, and he was afraid and fled and went to Egypt.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	26	22	Then King Jehoiakim sent men to Egypt: Elnathan the son of Achbor and certain men with him went into Egypt.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	26	23	And they brought Uriah from Egypt and led him to King Jehoiakim, who slew him with a sword and cast his dead body into the burial place of the common people.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	26	24	But the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, so that he was not given into the hands of the people to put him to death.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	27	1	In the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying--
Jeremiah	Jer	24	27	2	thus says the LORD to me--"Make for yourself bonds and yokes and put them on your neck,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	27	3	and send word to the king of Edom, to the king of Moab, to the king of the sons of Ammon, to the king of Tyre and to the king of Sidon by the messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	27	4	"Command them to go to their masters, saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, thus you shall say to your masters,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	27	5	"I have made the earth, the men and the beasts which are on the face of the earth by My great power and by My outstretched arm, and I will give it to the one who is pleasing in My sight.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	27	6	"Now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, My servant, and I have given him also the wild animals of the field to serve him.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	27	7	"All the nations shall serve him and his son and his grandson until the time of his own land comes; then many nations and great kings will make him their servant.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	27	8	"It will be, that the nation or the kingdom which will not serve him, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and which will not put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, I will punish that nation with the sword, with famine and with pestilence," declares the LORD, "until I have destroyed it by his hand.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	27	9	"But as for you, do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your dreamers, your soothsayers or your sorcerers who speak to you, saying, 'You will not serve the king of Babylon.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	27	10	"For they prophesy a lie to you in order to remove you far from your land; and I will drive you out and you will perish.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	27	11	"But the nation which will bring its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will let remain on its land," declares the LORD, "and they will till it and dwell in it."'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	27	12	I spoke words like all these to Zedekiah king of Judah, saying, "Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him and his people, and live!
Jeremiah	Jer	24	27	13	"Why will you die, you and your people, by the sword, famine and pestilence, as the LORD has spoken to that nation which will not serve the king of Babylon?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	27	14	"So do not listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you, saying, 'You will not serve the king of Babylon,' for they prophesy a lie to you;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	27	15	for I have not sent them," declares the LORD, "but they prophesy falsely in My name, in order that I may drive you out and that you may perish, you and the prophets who prophesy to you."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	27	16	Then I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, "Thus says the LORD: Do not listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you, saying, 'Behold, the vessels of the LORD'S house will now shortly be brought again from Babylon'; for they are prophesying a lie to you.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	27	17	"Do not listen to them; serve the king of Babylon, and live! Why should this city become a ruin?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	27	18	"But if they are prophets, and if the word of the LORD is with them, let them now entreat the LORD of hosts that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, in the house of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem may not go to Babylon.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	27	19	"For thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, concerning the sea, concerning the stands and concerning the rest of the vessels that are left in this city,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	27	20	which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take when he carried into exile Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	27	21	"Yes, thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that are left in the house of the LORD and in the house of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	27	22	'They will be carried to Babylon and they will be there until the day I visit them,' declares the LORD. 'Then I will bring them back and restore them to this place.'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	28	1	Now in the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet, who was from Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of the LORD in the presence of the priests and all the people, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	28	2	"Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, 'I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	28	3	'Within two years I am going to bring back to this place all the vessels of the LORD'S house, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place and carried to Babylon.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	28	4	'I am also going to bring back to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the exiles of Judah who went to Babylon,' declares the LORD, 'for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	28	5	Then the prophet Jeremiah spoke to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests and in the presence of all the people who were standing in the house of the LORD,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	28	6	and the prophet Jeremiah said, "Amen! May the LORD do so; may the LORD confirm your words which you have prophesied to bring back the vessels of the LORD'S house and all the exiles, from Babylon to this place.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	28	7	"Yet hear now this word which I am about to speak in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people!
Jeremiah	Jer	24	28	8	"The prophets who were before me and before you from ancient times prophesied against many lands and against great kingdoms, of war and of calamity and of pestilence.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	28	9	"The prophet who prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet comes to pass, then that prophet will be known as one whom the LORD has truly sent."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	28	10	Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet and broke it.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	28	11	Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, "Thus says the LORD, 'Even so will I break within two full years the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all the nations.'" Then the prophet Jeremiah went his way.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	28	12	The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah after Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	28	13	"Go and speak to Hananiah, saying, 'Thus says the LORD, "You have broken the yokes of wood, but you have made instead of them yokes of iron."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	28	14	'For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they will serve him. And I have also given him the beasts of the field."'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	28	15	Then Jeremiah the prophet said to Hananiah the prophet, "Listen now, Hananiah, the LORD has not sent you, and you have made this people trust in a lie.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	28	16	"Therefore thus says the LORD, 'Behold, I am about to remove you from the face of the earth. This year you are going to die, because you have counseled rebellion against the LORD.'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	28	17	So Hananiah the prophet died in the same year in the seventh month.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	29	1	Now these are the words of the letter which Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the rest of the elders of the exile, the priests, the prophets and all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	29	2	(This was after King Jeconiah and the queen mother, the court officials, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen and the smiths had departed from Jerusalem.)
Jeremiah	Jer	24	29	3	The letter was sent by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	29	4	"Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles whom I have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	29	5	'Build houses and live in them; and plant gardens and eat their produce.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	29	6	'Take wives and become the fathers of sons and daughters, and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; and multiply there and do not decrease.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	29	7	'Seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the LORD on its behalf; for in its welfare you will have welfare.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	29	8	"For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, 'Do not let your prophets who are in your midst and your diviners deceive you, and do not listen to the dreams which they dream.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	29	9	'For they prophesy falsely to you in My name; I have not sent them,' declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	29	10	"For thus says the LORD, 'When seventy years have been completed for Babylon, I will visit you and fulfill My good word to you, to bring you back to this place.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	29	11	'For I know the plans that I have for you,' declares the LORD, 'plans for welfare and not for calamity to give you a future and a hope.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	29	12	'Then you will call upon Me and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	29	13	'You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	29	14	'I will be found by you,' declares the LORD, 'and I will restore your fortunes and will gather you from all the nations and from all the places where I have driven you,' declares the LORD, 'and I will bring you back to the place from where I sent you into exile.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	29	15	"Because you have said, 'The LORD has raised up prophets for us in Babylon'--
Jeremiah	Jer	24	29	16	for thus says the LORD concerning the king who sits on the throne of David, and concerning all the people who dwell in this city, your brothers who did not go with you into exile--
Jeremiah	Jer	24	29	17	thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Behold, I am sending upon them the sword, famine and pestilence, and I will make them like split-open figs that cannot be eaten due to rottenness.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	29	18	'I will pursue them with the sword, with famine and with pestilence; and I will make them a terror to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse and a horror and a hissing, and a reproach among all the nations where I have driven them,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	29	19	because they have not listened to My words,' declares the LORD, 'which I sent to them again and again by My servants the prophets; but you did not listen,' declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	29	20	"You, therefore, hear the word of the LORD, all you exiles, whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	29	21	"Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying to you falsely in My name, 'Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will slay them before your eyes.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	29	22	'Because of them a curse will be used by all the exiles from Judah who are in Babylon, saying, "May the LORD make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	29	23	because they have acted foolishly in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbors' wives and have spoken words in My name falsely, which I did not command them; and I am He who knows and am a witness," declares the LORD.'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	29	24	To Shemaiah the Nehelamite you shall speak, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	29	25	"Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, 'Because you have sent letters in your own name to all the people who are in Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, and to all the priests, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	29	26	"The LORD has made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest, to be the overseer in the house of the LORD over every madman who prophesies, to put him in the stocks and in the iron collar,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	29	27	now then, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth who prophesies to you?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	29	28	"For he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, 'The exile will be long; build houses and live in them and plant gardens and eat their produce.'"'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	29	29	Zephaniah the priest read this letter to Jeremiah the prophet.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	29	30	Then came the word of the LORD to Jeremiah, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	29	31	"Send to all the exiles, saying, 'Thus says the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite, "Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, although I did not send him, and he has made you trust in a lie,"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	29	32	therefore thus says the LORD, "Behold, I am about to punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his descendants; he will not have anyone living among this people, and he will not see the good that I am about to do to My people," declares the LORD, "because he has preached rebellion against the LORD."'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	30	1	The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	30	2	"Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Write all the words which I have spoken to you in a book.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	30	3	'For behold, days are coming,' declares the LORD, 'when I will restore the fortunes of My people Israel and Judah.' The LORD says, 'I will also bring them back to the land that I gave to their forefathers and they shall possess it.'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	30	4	Now these are the words which the LORD spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah:
Jeremiah	Jer	24	30	5	"For thus says the LORD, 'I have heard a sound of terror, Of dread, and there is no peace.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	30	6	'Ask now, and see If a male can give birth. Why do I see every man With his hands on his loins, as a woman in childbirth? And why have all faces turned pale?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	30	7	'Alas! for that day is great, There is none like it; And it is the time of Jacob's distress, But he will be saved from it.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	30	8	'It shall come about on that day,' declares the LORD of hosts, 'that I will break his yoke from off their neck and will tear off their bonds; and strangers will no longer make them their slaves.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	30	9	'But they shall serve the LORD their God and David their king, whom I will raise up for them.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	30	10	'Fear not, O Jacob My servant,' declares the LORD, 'And do not be dismayed, O Israel; For behold, I will save you from afar And your offspring from the land of their captivity. And Jacob will return and will be quiet and at ease, And no one will make him afraid.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	30	11	'For I am with you,' declares the LORD, 'to save you; For I will destroy completely all the nations where I have scattered you, Only I will not destroy you completely. But I will chasten you justly And will by no means leave you unpunished.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	30	12	"For thus says the LORD, 'Your wound is incurable And your injury is serious.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	30	13	'There is no one to plead your cause; No healing for your sore, No recovery for you.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	30	14	'All your lovers have forgotten you, They do not seek you; For I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy, With the punishment of a cruel one, Because your iniquity is great And your sins are numerous.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	30	15	'Why do you cry out over your injury? Your pain is incurable. Because your iniquity is great And your sins are numerous, I have done these things to you.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	30	16	'Therefore all who devour you will be devoured; And all your adversaries, every one of them, will go into captivity; And those who plunder you will be for plunder, And all who prey upon you I will give for prey.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	30	17	'For I will restore you to health And I will heal you of your wounds,' declares the LORD, 'Because they have called you an outcast, saying: "It is Zion; no one cares for her."'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	30	18	"Thus says the LORD, 'Behold, I will restore the fortunes of the tents of Jacob And have compassion on his dwelling places; And the city will be rebuilt on its ruin, And the palace will stand on its rightful place.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	30	19	'From them will proceed thanksgiving And the voice of those who celebrate; And I will multiply them and they will not be diminished; I will also honor them and they will not be insignificant.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	30	20	'Their children also will be as formerly, And their congregation shall be established before Me; And I will punish all their oppressors.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	30	21	'Their leader shall be one of them, And their ruler shall come forth from their midst; And I will bring him near and he shall approach Me; For who would dare to risk his life to approach Me?' declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	30	22	'You shall be My people, And I will be your God.'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	30	23	Behold, the tempest of the LORD! Wrath has gone forth, A sweeping tempest; It will burst on the head of the wicked.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	30	24	The fierce anger of the LORD will not turn back Until He has performed and until He has accomplished The intent of His heart; In the latter days you will understand this.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	1	"At that time," declares the LORD, "I will be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be My people."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	2	Thus says the LORD, "The people who survived the sword Found grace in the wilderness-- Israel, when it went to find its rest."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	3	The LORD appeared to him from afar, saying, "I have loved you with an everlasting love; Therefore I have drawn you with lovingkindness.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	4	"Again I will build you and you will be rebuilt, O virgin of Israel! Again you will take up your tambourines, And go forth to the dances of the merrymakers.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	5	"Again you will plant vineyards On the hills of Samaria; The planters will plant And will enjoy them.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	6	"For there will be a day when watchmen On the hills of Ephraim call out, 'Arise, and let us go up to Zion, To the LORD our God.'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	7	For thus says the LORD, "Sing aloud with gladness for Jacob, And shout among the chief of the nations; Proclaim, give praise and say, 'O LORD, save Your people, The remnant of Israel.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	8	"Behold, I am bringing them from the north country, And I will gather them from the remote parts of the earth, Among them the blind and the lame, The woman with child and she who is in labor with child, together; A great company, they will return here.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	9	"With weeping they will come, And by supplication I will lead them; I will make them walk by streams of waters, On a straight path in which they will not stumble; For I am a father to Israel, And Ephraim is My firstborn."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	10	Hear the word of the LORD, O nations, And declare in the coastlands afar off, And say, "He who scattered Israel will gather him And keep him as a shepherd keeps his flock."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	11	For the LORD has ransomed Jacob And redeemed him from the hand of him who was stronger than he.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	12	"They will come and shout for joy on the height of Zion, And they will be radiant over the bounty of the LORD-- Over the grain and the new wine and the oil, And over the young of the flock and the herd; And their life will be like a watered garden, And they will never languish again.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	13	"Then the virgin will rejoice in the dance, And the young men and the old, together, For I will turn their mourning into joy And will comfort them and give them joy for their sorrow.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	14	"I will fill the soul of the priests with abundance, And My people will be satisfied with My goodness," declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	15	Thus says the LORD, "A voice is heard in Ramah, Lamentation and bitter weeping. Rachel is weeping for her children; She refuses to be comforted for her children, Because they are no more."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	16	Thus says the LORD, "Restrain your voice from weeping And your eyes from tears; For your work will be rewarded," declares the LORD, "And they will return from the land of the enemy.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	17	"There is hope for your future," declares the LORD, "And your children will return to their own territory.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	18	"I have surely heard Ephraim grieving, 'You have chastised me, and I was chastised, Like an untrained calf; Bring me back that I may be restored, For You are the LORD my God.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	19	'For after I turned back, I repented; And after I was instructed, I smote on my thigh; I was ashamed and also humiliated Because I bore the reproach of my youth.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	20	"Is Ephraim My dear son? Is he a delightful child? Indeed, as often as I have spoken against him, I certainly still remember him; Therefore My heart yearns for him; I will surely have mercy on him," declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	21	"Set up for yourself roadmarks, Place for yourself guideposts; Direct your mind to the highway, The way by which you went. Return, O virgin of Israel, Return to these your cities.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	22	"How long will you go here and there, O faithless daughter? For the LORD has created a new thing in the earth-- A woman will encompass a man."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	23	Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "Once again they will speak this word in the land of Judah and in its cities when I restore their fortunes, 'The LORD bless you, O abode of righteousness, O holy hill!'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	24	"Judah and all its cities will dwell together in it, the farmer and they who go about with flocks.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	25	"For I satisfy the weary ones and refresh everyone who languishes."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	26	At this I awoke and looked, and my sleep was pleasant to me.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	27	"Behold, days are coming," declares the LORD, "when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and with the seed of beast.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	28	"As I have watched over them to pluck up, to break down, to overthrow, to destroy and to bring disaster, so I will watch over them to build and to plant," declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	29	"In those days they will not say again, 'The fathers have eaten sour grapes, And the children's teeth are set on edge.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	30	"But everyone will die for his own iniquity; each man who eats the sour grapes, his teeth will be set on edge.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	31	"Behold, days are coming," declares the LORD, "when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	32	not like the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, My covenant which they broke, although I was a husband to them," declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	33	"But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days," declares the LORD, "I will put My law within them and on their heart I will write it; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	34	"They will not teach again, each man his neighbor and each man his brother, saying, 'Know the LORD,' for they will all know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them," declares the LORD, "for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	35	Thus says the LORD, Who gives the sun for light by day And the fixed order of the moon and the stars for light by night, Who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar; The LORD of hosts is His name:
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	36	"If this fixed order departs From before Me," declares the LORD, "Then the offspring of Israel also will cease From being a nation before Me forever."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	37	Thus says the LORD, "If the heavens above can be measured And the foundations of the earth searched out below, Then I will also cast off all the offspring of Israel For all that they have done," declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	38	"Behold, days are coming," declares the LORD, "when the city will be rebuilt for the LORD from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	39	"The measuring line will go out farther straight ahead to the hill Gareb; then it will turn to Goah.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	31	40	"And the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, and all the fields as far as the brook Kidron, to the corner of the Horse Gate toward the east, shall be holy to the LORD; it will not be plucked up or overthrown anymore forever."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	2	Now at that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the house of the king of Judah,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	3	because Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, "Why do you prophesy, saying, 'Thus says the LORD, "Behold, I am about to give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will take it;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	4	and Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but he will surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will speak with him face to face and see him eye to eye;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	5	and he will take Zedekiah to Babylon, and he will be there until I visit him," declares the LORD. "If you fight against the Chaldeans, you will not succeed"'?"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	6	And Jeremiah said, "The word of the LORD came to me, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	7	'Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle is coming to you, saying, "Buy for yourself my field which is at Anathoth, for you have the right of redemption to buy it."'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	8	"Then Hanamel my uncle's son came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of the LORD and said to me, 'Buy my field, please, that is at Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for you have the right of possession and the redemption is yours; buy it for yourself.' Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	9	"I bought the field which was at Anathoth from Hanamel my uncle's son, and I weighed out the silver for him, seventeen shekels of silver.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	10	"I signed and sealed the deed, and called in witnesses, and weighed out the silver on the scales.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	11	"Then I took the deeds of purchase, both the sealed copy containing the terms and conditions and the open copy;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	12	and I gave the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the sight of Hanamel my uncle's son and in the sight of the witnesses who signed the deed of purchase, before all the Jews who were sitting in the court of the guard.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	13	"And I commanded Baruch in their presence, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	14	'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "Take these deeds, this sealed deed of purchase and this open deed, and put them in an earthenware jar, that they may last a long time."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	15	'For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "Houses and fields and vineyards will again be bought in this land."'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	16	"After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, then I prayed to the LORD, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	17	'Ah Lord GOD! Behold, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and by Your outstretched arm! Nothing is too difficult for You,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	18	who shows lovingkindness to thousands, but repays the iniquity of fathers into the bosom of their children after them, O great and mighty God. The LORD of hosts is His name;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	19	great in counsel and mighty in deed, whose eyes are open to all the ways of the sons of men, giving to everyone according to his ways and according to the fruit of his deeds;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	20	who has set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, and even to this day both in Israel and among mankind; and You have made a name for Yourself, as at this day.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	21	'You brought Your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and with wonders, and with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm and with great terror;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	22	and gave them this land, which You swore to their forefathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	23	'They came in and took possession of it, but they did not obey Your voice or walk in Your law; they have done nothing of all that You commanded them to do; therefore You have made all this calamity come upon them.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	24	'Behold, the siege ramps have reached the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword, the famine and the pestilence; and what You have spoken has come to pass; and behold, You see it.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	25	'You have said to me, O Lord GOD, "Buy for yourself the field with money and call in witnesses"--although the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	26	Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	27	"Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh; is anything too difficult for Me?"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	28	Therefore thus says the LORD, "Behold, I am about to give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will take it.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	29	"The Chaldeans who are fighting against this city will enter and set this city on fire and burn it, with the houses where people have offered incense to Baal on their roofs and poured out drink offerings to other gods to provoke Me to anger.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	30	"Indeed the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah have been doing only evil in My sight from their youth; for the sons of Israel have been only provoking Me to anger by the work of their hands," declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	31	"Indeed this city has been to Me a provocation of My anger and My wrath from the day that they built it, even to this day, so that it should be removed from before My face,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	32	because of all the evil of the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah which they have done to provoke Me to anger--they, their kings, their leaders, their priests, their prophets, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	33	"They have turned their back to Me and not their face; though I taught them, teaching again and again, they would not listen and receive instruction.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	34	"But they put their detestable things in the house which is called by My name, to defile it.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	35	"They built the high places of Baal that are in the valley of Ben-hinnom to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire to Molech, which I had not commanded them nor had it entered My mind that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	36	"Now therefore thus says the LORD God of Israel concerning this city of which you say, 'It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by sword, by famine and by pestilence.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	37	"Behold, I will gather them out of all the lands to which I have driven them in My anger, in My wrath and in great indignation; and I will bring them back to this place and make them dwell in safety.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	38	"They shall be My people, and I will be their God;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	39	and I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear Me always, for their own good and for the good of their children after them.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	40	"I will make an everlasting covenant with them that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; and I will put the fear of Me in their hearts so that they will not turn away from Me.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	41	"I will rejoice over them to do them good and will faithfully plant them in this land with all My heart and with all My soul.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	42	"For thus says the LORD, 'Just as I brought all this great disaster on this people, so I am going to bring on them all the good that I am promising them.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	43	'Fields will be bought in this land of which you say, "It is a desolation, without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	32	44	'Men will buy fields for money, sign and seal deeds, and call in witnesses in the land of Benjamin, in the environs of Jerusalem, in the cities of Judah, in the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland and in the cities of the Negev; for I will restore their fortunes,' declares the LORD."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	33	1	Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the second time, while he was still confined in the court of the guard, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	33	2	"Thus says the LORD who made the earth, the LORD who formed it to establish it, the LORD is His name,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	33	3	'Call to Me and I will answer you, and I will tell you great and mighty things, which you do not know.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	33	4	"For thus says the LORD God of Israel concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah which are broken down to make a defense against the siege ramps and against the sword,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	33	5	'While they are coming to fight with the Chaldeans and to fill them with the corpses of men whom I have slain in My anger and in My wrath, and I have hidden My face from this city because of all their wickedness:
Jeremiah	Jer	24	33	6	'Behold, I will bring to it health and healing, and I will heal them; and I will reveal to them an abundance of peace and truth.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	33	7	'I will restore the fortunes of Judah and the fortunes of Israel and will rebuild them as they were at first.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	33	8	'I will cleanse them from all their iniquity by which they have sinned against Me, and I will pardon all their iniquities by which they have sinned against Me and by which they have transgressed against Me.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	33	9	'It will be to Me a name of joy, praise and glory before all the nations of the earth which will hear of all the good that I do for them, and they will fear and tremble because of all the good and all the peace that I make for it.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	33	10	"Thus says the LORD, 'Yet again there will be heard in this place, of which you say, "It is a waste, without man and without beast," that is, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate, without man and without inhabitant and without beast,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	33	11	the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those who say, "Give thanks to the LORD of hosts, For the LORD is good, For His lovingkindness is everlasting"; and of those who bring a thank offering into the house of the LORD. For I will restore the fortunes of the land as they were at first,' says the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	33	12	"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'There will again be in this place which is waste, without man or beast, and in all its cities, a habitation of shepherds who rest their flocks.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	33	13	'In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, in the cities of the Negev, in the land of Benjamin, in the environs of Jerusalem and in the cities of Judah, the flocks will again pass under the hands of the one who numbers them,' says the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	33	14	'Behold, days are coming,' declares the LORD, 'when I will fulfill the good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and the house of Judah.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	33	15	'In those days and at that time I will cause a righteous Branch of David to spring forth; and He shall execute justice and righteousness on the earth.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	33	16	'In those days Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will dwell in safety; and this is the name by which she will be called: the LORD is our righteousness.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	33	17	"For thus says the LORD, 'David shall never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	33	18	and the Levitical priests shall never lack a man before Me to offer burnt offerings, to burn grain offerings and to prepare sacrifices continually.'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	33	19	The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	33	20	"Thus says the LORD, 'If you can break My covenant for the day and My covenant for the night, so that day and night will not be at their appointed time,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	33	21	then My covenant may also be broken with David My servant so that he will not have a son to reign on his throne, and with the Levitical priests, My ministers.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	33	22	'As the host of heaven cannot be counted and the sand of the sea cannot be measured, so I will multiply the descendants of David My servant and the Levites who minister to Me.'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	33	23	And the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	33	24	"Have you not observed what this people have spoken, saying, 'The two families which the LORD chose, He has rejected them'? Thus they despise My people, no longer are they as a nation in their sight.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	33	25	"Thus says the LORD, 'If My covenant for day and night stand not, and the fixed patterns of heaven and earth I have not established,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	33	26	then I would reject the descendants of Jacob and David My servant, not taking from his descendants rulers over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. But I will restore their fortunes and will have mercy on them.'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	34	1	The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army, with all the kingdoms of the earth that were under his dominion and all the peoples, were fighting against Jerusalem and against all its cities, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	34	2	"Thus says the LORD God of Israel, 'Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah and say to him: "Thus says the LORD, 'Behold, I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it with fire.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	34	3	'You will not escape from his hand, for you will surely be captured and delivered into his hand; and you will see the king of Babylon eye to eye, and he will speak with you face to face, and you will go to Babylon.'"'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	34	4	"Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah! Thus says the LORD concerning you, 'You will not die by the sword.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	34	5	'You will die in peace; and as spices were burned for your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so they will burn spices for you; and they will lament for you, "Alas, lord!"' For I have spoken the word," declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	34	6	Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem
Jeremiah	Jer	24	34	7	when the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the remaining cities of Judah, that is, Lachish and Azekah, for they alone remained as fortified cities among the cities of Judah.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	34	8	The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who were in Jerusalem to proclaim release to them:
Jeremiah	Jer	24	34	9	that each man should set free his male servant and each man his female servant, a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman; so that no one should keep them, a Jew his brother, in bondage.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	34	10	And all the officials and all the people obeyed who had entered into the covenant that each man should set free his male servant and each man his female servant, so that no one should keep them any longer in bondage; they obeyed, and set them free.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	34	11	But afterward they turned around and took back the male servants and the female servants whom they had set free, and brought them into subjection for male servants and for female servants.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	34	12	Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	34	13	"Thus says the LORD God of Israel, 'I made a covenant with your forefathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	34	14	"At the end of seven years each of you shall set free his Hebrew brother who has been sold to you and has served you six years, you shall send him out free from you; but your forefathers did not obey Me or incline their ear to Me.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	34	15	"Although recently you had turned and done what is right in My sight, each man proclaiming release to his neighbor, and you had made a covenant before Me in the house which is called by My name.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	34	16	"Yet you turned and profaned My name, and each man took back his male servant and each man his female servant whom you had set free according to their desire, and you brought them into subjection to be your male servants and female servants."'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	34	17	"Therefore thus says the LORD, 'You have not obeyed Me in proclaiming release each man to his brother and each man to his neighbor. Behold, I am proclaiming a release to you,' declares the LORD, 'to the sword, to the pestilence and to the famine; and I will make you a terror to all the kingdoms of the earth.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	34	18	'I will give the men who have transgressed My covenant, who have not fulfilled the words of the covenant which they made before Me, when they cut the calf in two and passed between its parts--
Jeremiah	Jer	24	34	19	the officials of Judah and the officials of Jerusalem, the court officers and the priests and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf--
Jeremiah	Jer	24	34	20	I will give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their life. And their dead bodies will be food for the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	34	21	'Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials I will give into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their life, and into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon which has gone away from you.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	34	22	'Behold, I am going to command,' declares the LORD, 'and I will bring them back to this city; and they will fight against it and take it and burn it with fire; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without inhabitant.'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	35	1	The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	35	2	"Go to the house of the Rechabites and speak to them, and bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	35	3	Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, son of Habazziniah, and his brothers and all his sons and the whole house of the Rechabites,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	35	4	and I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was near the chamber of the officials, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the doorkeeper.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	35	5	Then I set before the men of the house of the Rechabites pitchers full of wine and cups; and I said to them, "Drink wine!"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	35	6	But they said, "We will not drink wine, for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying, 'You shall not drink wine, you or your sons, forever.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	35	7	'You shall not build a house, and you shall not sow seed and you shall not plant a vineyard or own one; but in tents you shall dwell all your days, that you may live many days in the land where you sojourn.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	35	8	"We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he commanded us, not to drink wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons or our daughters,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	35	9	nor to build ourselves houses to dwell in; and we do not have vineyard or field or seed.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	35	10	"We have only dwelt in tents, and have obeyed and have done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	35	11	"But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against the land, we said, 'Come and let us go to Jerusalem before the army of the Chaldeans and before the army of the Arameans.' So we have dwelt in Jerusalem."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	35	12	Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	35	13	"Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, 'Go and say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, "Will you not receive instruction by listening to My words?" declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	35	14	"The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, which he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are observed. So they do not drink wine to this day, for they have obeyed their father's command. But I have spoken to you again and again; yet you have not listened to Me.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	35	15	"Also I have sent to you all My servants the prophets, sending them again and again, saying: 'Turn now every man from his evil way and amend your deeds, and do not go after other gods to worship them. Then you will dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your forefathers; but you have not inclined your ear or listened to Me.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	35	16	'Indeed, the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have observed the command of their father which he commanded them, but this people has not listened to Me.'"'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	35	17	"Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, 'Behold, I am bringing on Judah and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the disaster that I have pronounced against them; because I spoke to them but they did not listen, and I have called them but they did not answer.'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	35	18	Then Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, 'Because you have obeyed the command of Jonadab your father, kept all his commands and done according to all that he commanded you;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	35	19	therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not lack a man to stand before Me always."'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	36	1	In the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	36	2	"Take a scroll and write on it all the words which I have spoken to you concerning Israel and concerning Judah, and concerning all the nations, from the day I first spoke to you, from the days of Josiah, even to this day.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	36	3	"Perhaps the house of Judah will hear all the calamity which I plan to bring on them, in order that every man will turn from his evil way; then I will forgive their iniquity and their sin."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	36	4	Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote on a scroll at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD which He had spoken to him.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	36	5	Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, "I am restricted; I cannot go into the house of the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	36	6	"So you go and read from the scroll which you have written at my dictation the words of the LORD to the people in the LORD'S house on a fast day. And also you shall read them to all the people of Judah who come from their cities.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	36	7	"Perhaps their supplication will come before the LORD, and everyone will turn from his evil way, for great is the anger and the wrath that the LORD has pronounced against this people."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	36	8	Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading from the book the words of the LORD in the LORD'S house.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	36	9	Now in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem proclaimed a fast before the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	36	10	Then Baruch read from the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the upper court, at the entry of the New Gate of the LORD'S house, to all the people.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	36	11	Now when Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard all the words of the LORD from the book,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	36	12	he went down to the king's house, into the scribe's chamber. And behold, all the officials were sitting there--Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the other officials.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	36	13	Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard when Baruch read from the book to the people.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	36	14	Then all the officials sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, "Take in your hand the scroll from which you have read to the people and come." So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and went to them.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	36	15	They said to him, "Sit down, please, and read it to us." So Baruch read it to them.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	36	16	When they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one to another and said to Baruch, "We will surely report all these words to the king."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	36	17	And they asked Baruch, saying, "Tell us, please, how did you write all these words? Was it at his dictation?"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	36	18	Then Baruch said to them, "He dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them with ink on the book."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	36	19	Then the officials said to Baruch, "Go, hide yourself, you and Jeremiah, and do not let anyone know where you are."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	36	20	So they went to the king in the court, but they had deposited the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and they reported all the words to the king.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	36	21	Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it to the king as well as to all the officials who stood beside the king.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	36	22	Now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month, with a fire burning in the brazier before him.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	36	23	When Jehudi had read three or four columns, the king cut it with a scribe's knife and threw it into the fire that was in the brazier, until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	36	24	Yet the king and all his servants who heard all these words were not afraid, nor did they rend their garments.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	36	25	Even though Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah pleaded with the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	36	26	And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king's son, Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet, but the LORD hid them.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	36	27	Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah after the king had burned the scroll and the words which Baruch had written at the dictation of Jeremiah, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	36	28	"Take again another scroll and write on it all the former words that were on the first scroll which Jehoiakim the king of Judah burned.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	36	29	"And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, 'Thus says the LORD, "You have burned this scroll, saying, 'Why have you written on it that the king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and will make man and beast to cease from it?'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	36	30	'Therefore thus says the LORD concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah, "He shall have no one to sit on the throne of David, and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat of the day and the frost of the night.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	36	31	"I will also punish him and his descendants and his servants for their iniquity, and I will bring on them and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the men of Judah all the calamity that I have declared to them--but they did not listen."'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	36	32	Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the son of Neriah, the scribe, and he wrote on it at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and many similar words were added to them.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	37	1	Now Zedekiah the son of Josiah whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had made king in the land of Judah, reigned as king in place of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	37	2	But neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land listened to the words of the LORD which He spoke through Jeremiah the prophet.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	37	3	Yet King Zedekiah sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to Jeremiah the prophet, saying, "Please pray to the LORD our God on our behalf."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	37	4	Now Jeremiah was still coming in and going out among the people, for they had not yet put him in the prison.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	37	5	Meanwhile, Pharaoh's army had set out from Egypt; and when the Chaldeans who had been besieging Jerusalem heard the report about them, they lifted the siege from Jerusalem.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	37	6	Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	37	7	"Thus says the LORD God of Israel, 'Thus you are to say to the king of Judah, who sent you to Me to inquire of Me: "Behold, Pharaoh's army which has come out for your assistance is going to return to its own land of Egypt.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	37	8	"The Chaldeans will also return and fight against this city, and they will capture it and burn it with fire."'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	37	9	"Thus says the LORD, 'Do not deceive yourselves, saying, "The Chaldeans will surely go away from us," for they will not go.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	37	10	'For even if you had defeated the entire army of Chaldeans who were fighting against you, and there were only wounded men left among them, each man in his tent, they would rise up and burn this city with fire.'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	37	11	Now it happened when the army of the Chaldeans had lifted the siege from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh's army,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	37	12	that Jeremiah went out from Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin in order to take possession of some property there among the people.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	37	13	While he was at the Gate of Benjamin, a captain of the guard whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah the son of Hananiah was there; and he arrested Jeremiah the prophet, saying, "You are going over to the Chaldeans!"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	37	14	But Jeremiah said, "A lie! I am not going over to the Chaldeans"; yet he would not listen to him. So Irijah arrested Jeremiah and brought him to the officials.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	37	15	Then the officials were angry at Jeremiah and beat him, and they put him in jail in the house of Jonathan the scribe, which they had made into the prison.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	37	16	For Jeremiah had come into the dungeon, that is, the vaulted cell; and Jeremiah stayed there many days.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	37	17	Now King Zedekiah sent and took him out; and in his palace the king secretly asked him and said, "Is there a word from the LORD?" And Jeremiah said, "There is!" Then he said, "You will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon!"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	37	18	Moreover Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, "In what way have I sinned against you, or against your servants, or against this people, that you have put me in prison?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	37	19	"Where then are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, 'The king of Babylon will not come against you or against this land'?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	37	20	"But now, please listen, O my lord the king; please let my petition come before you and do not make me return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, that I may not die there."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	37	21	Then King Zedekiah gave commandment, and they committed Jeremiah to the court of the guardhouse and gave him a loaf of bread daily from the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the court of the guardhouse.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	38	1	Now Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchijah heard the words that Jeremiah was speaking to all the people, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	38	2	"Thus says the LORD, 'He who stays in this city will die by the sword and by famine and by pestilence, but he who goes out to the Chaldeans will live and have his own life as booty and stay alive.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	38	3	"Thus says the LORD, 'This city will certainly be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon and he will capture it.'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	38	4	Then the officials said to the king, "Now let this man be put to death, inasmuch as he is discouraging the men of war who are left in this city and all the people, by speaking such words to them; for this man is not seeking the well-being of this people but rather their harm."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	38	5	So King Zedekiah said, "Behold, he is in your hands; for the king can do nothing against you."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	38	6	Then they took Jeremiah and cast him into the cistern of Malchijah the king's son, which was in the court of the guardhouse; and they let Jeremiah down with ropes. Now in the cistern there was no water but only mud, and Jeremiah sank into the mud.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	38	7	But Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, while he was in the king's palace, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern. Now the king was sitting in the Gate of Benjamin;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	38	8	and Ebed-melech went out from the king's palace and spoke to the king, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	38	9	"My lord the king, these men have acted wickedly in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet whom they have cast into the cistern; and he will die right where he is because of the famine, for there is no more bread in the city."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	38	10	Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, "Take thirty men from here under your authority and bring up Jeremiah the prophet from the cistern before he dies."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	38	11	So Ebed-melech took the men under his authority and went into the king's palace to a place beneath the storeroom and took from there worn-out clothes and worn-out rags and let them down by ropes into the cistern to Jeremiah.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	38	12	Then Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, "Now put these worn-out clothes and rags under your armpits under the ropes"; and Jeremiah did so.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	38	13	So they pulled Jeremiah up with the ropes and lifted him out of the cistern, and Jeremiah stayed in the court of the guardhouse.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	38	14	Then King Zedekiah sent and had Jeremiah the prophet brought to him at the third entrance that is in the house of the LORD; and the king said to Jeremiah, "I am going to ask you something; do not hide anything from me."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	38	15	Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "If I tell you, will you not certainly put me to death? Besides, if I give you advice, you will not listen to me."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	38	16	But King Zedekiah swore to Jeremiah in secret saying, "As the LORD lives, who made this life for us, surely I will not put you to death nor will I give you over to the hand of these men who are seeking your life."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	38	17	Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "Thus says the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, 'If you will indeed go out to the officers of the king of Babylon, then you will live, this city will not be burned with fire, and you and your household will survive.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	38	18	'But if you will not go out to the officers of the king of Babylon, then this city will be given over to the hand of the Chaldeans; and they will burn it with fire, and you yourself will not escape from their hand.'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	38	19	Then King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, "I dread the Jews who have gone over to the Chaldeans, for they may give me over into their hand and they will abuse me."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	38	20	But Jeremiah said, "They will not give you over. Please obey the LORD in what I am saying to you, that it may go well with you and you may live.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	38	21	"But if you keep refusing to go out, this is the word which the LORD has shown me:
Jeremiah	Jer	24	38	22	'Then behold, all of the women who have been left in the palace of the king of Judah are going to be brought out to the officers of the king of Babylon; and those women will say, "Your close friends Have misled and overpowered you; While your feet were sunk in the mire, They turned back."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	38	23	'They will also bring out all your wives and your sons to the Chaldeans, and you yourself will not escape from their hand, but will be seized by the hand of the king of Babylon, and this city will be burned with fire.'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	38	24	Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, "Let no man know about these words and you will not die.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	38	25	"But if the officials hear that I have talked with you and come to you and say to you, 'Tell us now what you said to the king and what the king said to you; do not hide it from us and we will not put you to death,'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	38	26	then you are to say to them, 'I was presenting my petition before the king, not to make me return to the house of Jonathan to die there.'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	38	27	Then all the officials came to Jeremiah and questioned him. So he reported to them in accordance with all these words which the king had commanded; and they ceased speaking with him, since the conversation had not been overheard.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	38	28	So Jeremiah stayed in the court of the guardhouse until the day that Jerusalem was captured.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	39	1	Now when Jerusalem was captured in the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came to Jerusalem and laid siege to it;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	39	2	in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the city wall was breached.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	39	3	Then all the officials of the king of Babylon came in and sat down at the Middle Gate: Nergal-sar-ezer, Samgar-nebu, Sar-sekim the Rab-saris, Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag, and all the rest of the officials of the king of Babylon.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	39	4	When Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, they fled and went out of the city at night by way of the king's garden through the gate between the two walls; and he went out toward the Arabah.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	39	5	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and they seized him and brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence on him.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	39	6	Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes at Riblah; the king of Babylon also slew all the nobles of Judah.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	39	7	He then blinded Zedekiah's eyes and bound him in fetters of bronze to bring him to Babylon.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	39	8	The Chaldeans also burned with fire the king's palace and the houses of the people, and they broke down the walls of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	39	9	As for the rest of the people who were left in the city, the deserters who had gone over to him and the rest of the people who remained, Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard carried them into exile in Babylon.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	39	10	But some of the poorest people who had nothing, Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard left behind in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at that time.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	39	11	Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave orders about Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	39	12	"Take him and look after him, and do nothing harmful to him, but rather deal with him just as he tells you."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	39	13	So Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard sent word, along with Nebushazban the Rab-saris, and Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag, and all the leading officers of the king of Babylon;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	39	14	they even sent and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guardhouse and entrusted him to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to take him home. So he stayed among the people.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	39	15	Now the word of the LORD had come to Jeremiah while he was confined in the court of the guardhouse, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	39	16	"Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "Behold, I am about to bring My words on this city for disaster and not for prosperity; and they will take place before you on that day.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	39	17	"But I will deliver you on that day," declares the LORD, "and you will not be given into the hand of the men whom you dread.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	39	18	"For I will certainly rescue you, and you will not fall by the sword; but you will have your own life as booty, because you have trusted in Me," declares the LORD.'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	40	1	The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD after Nebuzaradan captain of the bodyguard had released him from Ramah, when he had taken him bound in chains among all the exiles of Jerusalem and Judah who were being exiled to Babylon.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	40	2	Now the captain of the bodyguard had taken Jeremiah and said to him, "The LORD your God promised this calamity against this place;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	40	3	and the LORD has brought it on and done just as He promised. Because you people sinned against the LORD and did not listen to His voice, therefore this thing has happened to you.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	40	4	"But now, behold, I am freeing you today from the chains which are on your hands. If you would prefer to come with me to Babylon, come along, and I will look after you; but if you would prefer not to come with me to Babylon, never mind. Look, the whole land is before you; go wherever it seems good and right for you to go."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	40	5	As Jeremiah was still not going back, he said, "Go on back then to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed over the cities of Judah, and stay with him among the people; or else go anywhere it seems right for you to go." So the captain of the bodyguard gave him a ration and a gift and let him go.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	40	6	Then Jeremiah went to Mizpah to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam and stayed with him among the people who were left in the land.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	40	7	Now all the commanders of the forces that were in the field, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam over the land and that he had put him in charge of the men, women and children, those of the poorest of the land who had not been exiled to Babylon.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	40	8	So they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah, along with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, both they and their men.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	40	9	Then Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, swore to them and to their men, saying, "Do not be afraid of serving the Chaldeans; stay in the land and serve the king of Babylon, that it may go well with you.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	40	10	"Now as for me, behold, I am going to stay at Mizpah to stand for you before the Chaldeans who come to us; but as for you, gather in wine and summer fruit and oil and put them in your storage vessels, and live in your cities that you have taken over."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	40	11	Likewise, also all the Jews who were in Moab and among the sons of Ammon and in Edom and who were in all the other countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant for Judah, and that he had appointed over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	40	12	Then all the Jews returned from all the places to which they had been driven away and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and gathered in wine and summer fruit in great abundance.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	40	13	Now Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were in the field came to Gedaliah at Mizpah
Jeremiah	Jer	24	40	14	and said to him, "Are you well aware that Baalis the king of the sons of Ammon has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life?" But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam did not believe them.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	40	15	Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke secretly to Gedaliah in Mizpah, saying, "Let me go and kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and not a man will know! Why should he take your life, so that all the Jews who are gathered to you would be scattered and the remnant of Judah would perish?"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	40	16	But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, "Do not do this thing, for you are telling a lie about Ishmael."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	41	1	In the seventh month Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal family and one of the chief officers of the king, along with ten men, came to Mizpah to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. While they were eating bread together there in Mizpah,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	41	2	Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him arose and struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword and put to death the one whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	41	3	Ishmael also struck down all the Jews who were with him, that is with Gedaliah at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans who were found there, the men of war.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	41	4	Now it happened on the next day after the killing of Gedaliah, when no one knew about it,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	41	5	that eighty men came from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria with their beards shaved off and their clothes torn and their bodies gashed, having grain offerings and incense in their hands to bring to the house of the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	41	6	Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he went; and as he met them, he said to them, "Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam!"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	41	7	Yet it turned out that as soon as they came inside the city, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the men that were with him slaughtered them and cast them into the cistern.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	41	8	But ten men who were found among them said to Ishmael, "Do not put us to death; for we have stores of wheat, barley, oil and honey hidden in the field." So he refrained and did not put them to death along with their companions.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	41	9	Now as for the cistern where Ishmael had cast all the corpses of the men whom he had struck down because of Gedaliah, it was the one that King Asa had made on account of Baasha, king of Israel; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	41	10	Then Ishmael took captive all the remnant of the people who were in Mizpah, the king's daughters and all the people who were left in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard had put under the charge of Gedaliah the son of Ahikam; thus Ishmael the son of Nethaniah took them captive and proceeded to cross over to the sons of Ammon.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	41	11	But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were with him heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	41	12	So they took all the men and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and they found him by the great pool that is in Gibeon.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	41	13	Now as soon as all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah and the commanders of the forces that were with him, they were glad.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	41	14	So all the people whom Ishmael had taken captive from Mizpah turned around and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	41	15	But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men and went to the sons of Ammon.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	41	16	Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were with him took from Mizpah all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, after he had struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, that is, the men who were soldiers, the women, the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	41	17	And they went and stayed in Geruth Chimham, which is beside Bethlehem, in order to proceed into Egypt
Jeremiah	Jer	24	41	18	because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, since Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	42	1	Then all the commanders of the forces, Johanan the son of Kareah, Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people both small and great approached
Jeremiah	Jer	24	42	2	and said to Jeremiah the prophet, "Please let our petition come before you, and pray for us to the LORD your God, that is for all this remnant; because we are left but a few out of many, as your own eyes now see us,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	42	3	that the LORD your God may tell us the way in which we should walk and the thing that we should do."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	42	4	Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, "I have heard you. Behold, I am going to pray to the LORD your God in accordance with your words; and I will tell you the whole message which the LORD will answer you. I will not keep back a word from you."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	42	5	Then they said to Jeremiah, "May the LORD be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not act in accordance with the whole message with which the LORD your God will send you to us.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	42	6	"Whether it is pleasant or unpleasant, we will listen to the voice of the LORD our God to whom we are sending you, so that it may go well with us when we listen to the voice of the LORD our God."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	42	7	Now at the end of ten days the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	42	8	Then he called for Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were with him, and for all the people both small and great,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	42	9	and said to them, "Thus says the LORD the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your petition before Him:
Jeremiah	Jer	24	42	10	'If you will indeed stay in this land, then I will build you up and not tear you down, and I will plant you and not uproot you; for I will relent concerning the calamity that I have inflicted on you.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	42	11	'Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, whom you are now fearing; do not be afraid of him,' declares the LORD, 'for I am with you to save you and deliver you from his hand.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	42	12	'I will also show you compassion, so that he will have compassion on you and restore you to your own soil.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	42	13	'But if you are going to say, "We will not stay in this land," so as not to listen to the voice of the LORD your God,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	42	14	saying, "No, but we will go to the land of Egypt, where we will not see war or hear the sound of a trumpet or hunger for bread, and we will stay there";
Jeremiah	Jer	24	42	15	then in that case listen to the word of the LORD, O remnant of Judah. Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "If you really set your mind to enter Egypt and go in to reside there,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	42	16	then the sword, which you are afraid of, will overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the famine, about which you are anxious, will follow closely after you there in Egypt, and you will die there.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	42	17	"So all the men who set their mind to go to Egypt to reside there will die by the sword, by famine and by pestilence; and they will have no survivors or refugees from the calamity that I am going to bring on them."'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	42	18	For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "As My anger and wrath have been poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so My wrath will be poured out on you when you enter Egypt. And you will become a curse, an object of horror, an imprecation and a reproach; and you will see this place no more."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	42	19	The LORD has spoken to you, O remnant of Judah, "Do not go into Egypt!" You should clearly understand that today I have testified against you.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	42	20	For you have only deceived yourselves; for it is you who sent me to the LORD your God, saying, "Pray for us to the LORD our God; and whatever the LORD our God says, tell us so, and we will do it."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	42	21	So I have told you today, but you have not obeyed the LORD your God, even in whatever He has sent me to tell you.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	42	22	Therefore you should now clearly understand that you will die by the sword, by famine and by pestilence, in the place where you wish to go to reside.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	43	1	But as soon as Jeremiah, whom the LORD their God had sent, had finished telling all the people all the words of the LORD their God--that is, all these words--
Jeremiah	Jer	24	43	2	Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the arrogant men said to Jeremiah, "You are telling a lie! The LORD our God has not sent you to say, 'You are not to enter Egypt to reside there';
Jeremiah	Jer	24	43	3	but Baruch the son of Neriah is inciting you against us to give us over into the hand of the Chaldeans, so they will put us to death or exile us to Babylon."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	43	4	So Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces, and all the people, did not obey the voice of the LORD to stay in the land of Judah.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	43	5	But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces took the entire remnant of Judah who had returned from all the nations to which they had been driven away, in order to reside in the land of Judah--
Jeremiah	Jer	24	43	6	the men, the women, the children, the king's daughters and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, together with Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch the son of Neriah--
Jeremiah	Jer	24	43	7	and they entered the land of Egypt (for they did not obey the voice of the LORD) and went in as far as Tahpanhes.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	43	8	Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	43	9	"Take some large stones in your hands and hide them in the mortar in the brick terrace which is at the entrance of Pharaoh's palace in Tahpanhes, in the sight of some of the Jews;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	43	10	and say to them, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "Behold, I am going to send and get Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, My servant, and I am going to set his throne right over these stones that I have hidden; and he will spread his canopy over them.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	43	11	"He will also come and strike the land of Egypt; those who are meant for death will be given over to death, and those for captivity to captivity, and those for the sword to the sword.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	43	12	"And I shall set fire to the temples of the gods of Egypt, and he will burn them and take them captive. So he will wrap himself with the land of Egypt as a shepherd wraps himself with his garment, and he will depart from there safely.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	43	13	"He will also shatter the obelisks of Heliopolis, which is in the land of Egypt; and the temples of the gods of Egypt he will burn with fire."'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	44	1	The word that came to Jeremiah for all the Jews living in the land of Egypt, those who were living in Migdol, Tahpanhes, Memphis, and the land of Pathros, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	44	2	"Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, 'You yourselves have seen all the calamity that I have brought on Jerusalem and all the cities of Judah; and behold, this day they are in ruins and no one lives in them,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	44	3	because of their wickedness which they committed so as to provoke Me to anger by continuing to burn sacrifices and to serve other gods whom they had not known, neither they, you, nor your fathers.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	44	4	'Yet I sent you all My servants the prophets, again and again, saying, "Oh, do not do this abominable thing which I hate."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	44	5	'But they did not listen or incline their ears to turn from their wickedness, so as not to burn sacrifices to other gods.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	44	6	'Therefore My wrath and My anger were poured out and burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, so they have become a ruin and a desolation as it is this day.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	44	7	'Now then thus says the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, "Why are you doing great harm to yourselves, so as to cut off from you man and woman, child and infant, from among Judah, leaving yourselves without remnant,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	44	8	provoking Me to anger with the works of your hands, burning sacrifices to other gods in the land of Egypt, where you are entering to reside, so that you might be cut off and become a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	44	9	"Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	44	10	"But they have not become contrite even to this day, nor have they feared nor walked in My law or My statutes, which I have set before you and before your fathers."'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	44	11	"Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, 'Behold, I am going to set My face against you for woe, even to cut off all Judah.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	44	12	'And I will take away the remnant of Judah who have set their mind on entering the land of Egypt to reside there, and they will all meet their end in the land of Egypt; they will fall by the sword and meet their end by famine. Both small and great will die by the sword and famine; and they will become a curse, an object of horror, an imprecation and a reproach.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	44	13	'And I will punish those who live in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, with the sword, with famine and with pestilence.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	44	14	'So there will be no refugees or survivors for the remnant of Judah who have entered the land of Egypt to reside there and then to return to the land of Judah, to which they are longing to return and live; for none will return except a few refugees.'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	44	15	Then all the men who were aware that their wives were burning sacrifices to other gods, along with all the women who were standing by, as a large assembly, including all the people who were living in Pathros in the land of Egypt, responded to Jeremiah, saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	44	16	"As for the message that you have spoken to us in the name of the LORD, we are not going to listen to you!
Jeremiah	Jer	24	44	17	"But rather we will certainly carry out every word that has proceeded from our mouths, by burning sacrifices to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, just as we ourselves, our forefathers, our kings and our princes did in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then we had plenty of food and were well off and saw no misfortune.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	44	18	"But since we stopped burning sacrifices to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked everything and have met our end by the sword and by famine."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	44	19	"And," said the women, "when we were burning sacrifices to the queen of heaven and were pouring out drink offerings to her, was it without our husbands that we made for her sacrificial cakes in her image and poured out drink offerings to her?"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	44	20	Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men and women--even to all the people who were giving him such an answer--saying,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	44	21	"As for the smoking sacrifices that you burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your forefathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them and did not all this come into His mind?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	44	22	"So the LORD was no longer able to endure it, because of the evil of your deeds, because of the abominations which you have committed; thus your land has become a ruin, an object of horror and a curse, without an inhabitant, as it is this day.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	44	23	"Because you have burned sacrifices and have sinned against the LORD and not obeyed the voice of the LORD or walked in His law, His statutes or His testimonies, therefore this calamity has befallen you, as it has this day."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	44	24	Then Jeremiah said to all the people, including all the women, "Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah who are in the land of Egypt,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	44	25	thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, as follows: 'As for you and your wives, you have spoken with your mouths and fulfilled it with your hands, saying, "We will certainly perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn sacrifices to the queen of heaven and pour out drink offerings to her." Go ahead and confirm your vows, and certainly perform your vows!'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	44	26	"Nevertheless hear the word of the LORD, all Judah who are living in the land of Egypt, 'Behold, I have sworn by My great name,' says the LORD, 'never shall My name be invoked again by the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, "As the Lord GOD lives."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	44	27	'Behold, I am watching over them for harm and not for good, and all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt will meet their end by the sword and by famine until they are completely gone.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	44	28	'Those who escape the sword will return out of the land of Egypt to the land of Judah few in number. Then all the remnant of Judah who have gone to the land of Egypt to reside there will know whose word will stand, Mine or theirs.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	44	29	'This will be the sign to you,' declares the LORD, 'that I am going to punish you in this place, so that you may know that My words will surely stand against you for harm.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	44	30	"Thus says the LORD, 'Behold, I am going to give over Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt to the hand of his enemies, to the hand of those who seek his life, just as I gave over Zedekiah king of Judah to the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who was his enemy and was seeking his life.'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	45	1	This is the message which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah, when he had written down these words in a book at Jeremiah's dictation, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying:
Jeremiah	Jer	24	45	2	"Thus says the LORD the God of Israel to you, O Baruch:
Jeremiah	Jer	24	45	3	'You said, "Ah, woe is me! For the LORD has added sorrow to my pain; I am weary with my groaning and have found no rest."'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	45	4	"Thus you are to say to him, 'Thus says the LORD, "Behold, what I have built I am about to tear down, and what I have planted I am about to uproot, that is, the whole land."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	45	5	'But you, are you seeking great things for yourself? Do not seek them; for behold, I am going to bring disaster on all flesh,' declares the LORD, 'but I will give your life to you as booty in all the places where you may go.'"
Jeremiah	Jer	24	46	1	That which came as the word of the LORD to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	46	2	To Egypt, concerning the army of Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt, which was by the Euphrates River at Carchemish, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon defeated in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah:
Jeremiah	Jer	24	46	3	"Line up the shield and buckler, And draw near for the battle!
Jeremiah	Jer	24	46	4	"Harness the horses, And mount the steeds, And take your stand with helmets on! Polish the spears, Put on the scale-armor!
Jeremiah	Jer	24	46	5	"Why have I seen it? They are terrified, They are drawing back, And their mighty men are defeated And have taken refuge in flight, Without facing back; Terror is on every side!" Declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	46	6	Let not the swift man flee, Nor the mighty man escape; In the north beside the river Euphrates They have stumbled and fallen.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	46	7	Who is this that rises like the Nile, Like the rivers whose waters surge about?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	46	8	Egypt rises like the Nile, Even like the rivers whose waters surge about; And He has said, "I will rise and cover that land; I will surely destroy the city and its inhabitants."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	46	9	Go up, you horses, and drive madly, you chariots, That the mighty men may march forward: Ethiopia and Put, that handle the shield, And the Lydians, that handle and bend the bow.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	46	10	For that day belongs to the Lord GOD of hosts, A day of vengeance, so as to avenge Himself on His foes; And the sword will devour and be satiated And drink its fill of their blood; For there will be a slaughter for the Lord GOD of hosts, In the land of the north by the river Euphrates.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	46	11	Go up to Gilead and obtain balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt! In vain have you multiplied remedies; There is no healing for you.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	46	12	The nations have heard of your shame, And the earth is full of your cry of distress; For one warrior has stumbled over another, And both of them have fallen down together.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	46	13	This is the message which the LORD spoke to Jeremiah the prophet about the coming of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to smite the land of Egypt:
Jeremiah	Jer	24	46	14	"Declare in Egypt and proclaim in Migdol, Proclaim also in Memphis and Tahpanhes; Say, 'Take your stand and get yourself ready, For the sword has devoured those around you.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	46	15	"Why have your mighty ones become prostrate? They do not stand because the LORD has thrust them down.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	46	16	"They have repeatedly stumbled; Indeed, they have fallen one against another. Then they said, 'Get up! And let us go back To our own people and our native land Away from the sword of the oppressor.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	46	17	"They cried there, 'Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a big noise; He has let the appointed time pass by!'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	46	18	"As I live," declares the King Whose name is the LORD of hosts, "Surely one shall come who looms up like Tabor among the mountains, Or like Carmel by the sea.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	46	19	"Make your baggage ready for exile, O daughter dwelling in Egypt, For Memphis will become a desolation; It will even be burned down and bereft of inhabitants.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	46	20	"Egypt is a pretty heifer, But a horsefly is coming from the north--it is coming!
Jeremiah	Jer	24	46	21	"Also her mercenaries in her midst Are like fattened calves, For even they too have turned back and have fled away together; They did not stand their ground. For the day of their calamity has come upon them, The time of their punishment.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	46	22	"Its sound moves along like a serpent; For they move on like an army And come to her as woodcutters with axes.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	46	23	"They have cut down her forest," declares the LORD; "Surely it will no more be found, Even though they are now more numerous than locusts And are without number.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	46	24	"The daughter of Egypt has been put to shame, Given over to the power of the people of the north."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	46	25	The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, says, "Behold, I am going to punish Amon of Thebes, and Pharaoh, and Egypt along with her gods and her kings, even Pharaoh and those who trust in him.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	46	26	"I shall give them over to the power of those who are seeking their lives, even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of his officers. Afterwards, however, it will be inhabited as in the days of old," declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	46	27	"But as for you, O Jacob My servant, do not fear, Nor be dismayed, O Israel! For, see, I am going to save you from afar, And your descendants from the land of their captivity; And Jacob will return and be undisturbed And secure, with no one making him tremble.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	46	28	"O Jacob My servant, do not fear," declares the LORD, "For I am with you. For I will make a full end of all the nations Where I have driven you, Yet I will not make a full end of you; But I will correct you properly And by no means leave you unpunished."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	47	1	That which came as the word of the LORD to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines, before Pharaoh conquered Gaza.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	47	2	Thus says the LORD: "Behold, waters are going to rise from the north And become an overflowing torrent, And overflow the land and all its fullness, The city and those who live in it; And the men will cry out, And every inhabitant of the land will wail.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	47	3	"Because of the noise of the galloping hoofs of his stallions, The tumult of his chariots, and the rumbling of his wheels, The fathers have not turned back for their children, Because of the limpness of their hands,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	47	4	On account of the day that is coming To destroy all the Philistines, To cut off from Tyre and Sidon Every ally that is left; For the LORD is going to destroy the Philistines, The remnant of the coastland of Caphtor.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	47	5	"Baldness has come upon Gaza; Ashkelon has been ruined. O remnant of their valley, How long will you gash yourself?
Jeremiah	Jer	24	47	6	"Ah, sword of the LORD, How long will you not be quiet? Withdraw into your sheath; Be at rest and stay still.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	47	7	"How can it be quiet, When the LORD has given it an order? Against Ashkelon and against the seacoast-- There He has assigned it."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	48	1	Concerning Moab. Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "Woe to Nebo, for it has been destroyed; Kiriathaim has been put to shame, it has been captured; The lofty stronghold has been put to shame and shattered.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	48	2	"There is praise for Moab no longer; In Heshbon they have devised calamity against her: 'Come and let us cut her off from being a nation!' You too, Madmen, will be silenced; The sword will follow after you.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	48	3	"The sound of an outcry from Horonaim, 'Devastation and great destruction!'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	48	4	"Moab is broken, Her little ones have sounded out a cry of distress.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	48	5	"For by the ascent of Luhith They will ascend with continual weeping; For at the descent of Horonaim They have heard the anguished cry of destruction.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	48	6	"Flee, save your lives, That you may be like a juniper in the wilderness.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	48	7	"For because of your trust in your own achievements and treasures, Even you yourself will be captured; And Chemosh will go off into exile Together with his priests and his princes.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	48	8	"A destroyer will come to every city, So that no city will escape; The valley also will be ruined And the plateau will be destroyed, As the LORD has said.

Jeremiah	Jer	24	51	35	"May the violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon," The inhabitant of Zion will say; And, "May my blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea," Jerusalem will say.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	51	36	Therefore thus says the LORD, "Behold, I am going to plead your case And exact full vengeance for you; And I will dry up her sea And make her fountain dry.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	51	37	"Babylon will become a heap of ruins, a haunt of jackals, An object of horror and hissing, without inhabitants.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	51	38	"They will roar together like young lions, They will growl like lions' cubs.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	51	39	"When they become heated up, I will serve them their banquet And make them drunk, that they may become jubilant And may sleep a perpetual sleep And not wake up," declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	51	40	"I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, Like rams together with male goats.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	51	41	"How Sheshak has been captured, And the praise of the whole earth been seized! How Babylon has become an object of horror among the nations!
Jeremiah	Jer	24	51	42	"The sea has come up over Babylon; She has been engulfed with its tumultuous waves.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	51	43	"Her cities have become an object of horror, A parched land and a desert, A land in which no man lives And through which no son of man passes.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	51	44	"I will punish Bel in Babylon, And I will make what he has swallowed come out of his mouth; And the nations will no longer stream to him. Even the wall of Babylon has fallen down!
Jeremiah	Jer	24	51	45	"Come forth from her midst, My people, And each of you save yourselves From the fierce anger of the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	51	46	"Now so that your heart does not grow faint, And you are not afraid at the report that will be heard in the land-- For the report will come one year, And after that another report in another year, And violence will be in the land With ruler against ruler--
Jeremiah	Jer	24	51	47	Therefore behold, days are coming When I will punish the idols of Babylon; And her whole land will be put to shame And all her slain will fall in her midst.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	51	48	"Then heaven and earth and all that is in them Will shout for joy over Babylon, For the destroyers will come to her from the north," Declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	51	49	Indeed Babylon is to fall for the slain of Israel, As also for Babylon the slain of all the earth have fallen.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	51	50	You who have escaped the sword, Depart! Do not stay! Remember the LORD from afar, And let Jerusalem come to your mind.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	51	51	We are ashamed because we have heard reproach; Disgrace has covered our faces, For aliens have entered The holy places of the LORD'S house.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	51	52	"Therefore behold, the days are coming," declares the LORD, "When I will punish her idols, And the mortally wounded will groan throughout her land.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	51	53	"Though Babylon should ascend to the heavens, And though she should fortify her lofty stronghold, From Me destroyers will come to her," declares the LORD.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	51	54	The sound of an outcry from Babylon, And of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans!
Jeremiah	Jer	24	51	55	For the LORD is going to destroy Babylon, And He will make her loud noise vanish from her. And their waves will roar like many waters; The tumult of their voices sounds forth.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	51	56	For the destroyer is coming against her, against Babylon, And her mighty men will be captured, Their bows are shattered; For the LORD is a God of recompense, He will fully repay.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	51	57	"I will make her princes and her wise men drunk, Her governors, her prefects and her mighty men, That they may sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake up," Declares the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	51	58	Thus says the LORD of hosts, "The broad wall of Babylon will be completely razed And her high gates will be set on fire; So the peoples will toil for nothing, And the nations become exhausted only for fire."
Jeremiah	Jer	24	51	59	The message which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the grandson of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. (Now Seraiah was quartermaster.)
Jeremiah	Jer	24	51	60	So Jeremiah wrote in a single scroll all the calamity which would come upon Babylon, that is, all these words which have been written concerning Babylon.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	51	61	Then Jeremiah said to Seraiah, "As soon as you come to Babylon, then see that you read all these words aloud,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	51	62	and say, 'You, O LORD, have promised concerning this place to cut it off, so that there will be nothing dwelling in it, whether man or beast, but it will be a perpetual desolation.'
Jeremiah	Jer	24	51	63	"And as soon as you finish reading this scroll, you will tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle of the Euphrates,
Jeremiah	Jer	24	51	64	and say, 'Just so shall Babylon sink down and not rise again because of the calamity that I am going to bring upon her; and they will become exhausted.'" Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	52	1	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	52	2	He did evil in the sight of the LORD like all that Jehoiakim had done.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	52	3	For through the anger of the LORD this came about in Jerusalem and Judah until He cast them out from His presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	52	4	Now it came about in the ninth year of his reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, camped against it and built a siege wall all around it.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	52	5	So the city was under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	52	6	On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	52	7	Then the city was broken into, and all the men of war fled and went forth from the city at night by way of the gate between the two walls which was by the king's garden, though the Chaldeans were all around the city. And they went by way of the Arabah.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	52	8	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho, and all his army was scattered from him.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	52	9	Then they captured the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence on him.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	52	10	The king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and he also slaughtered all the princes of Judah in Riblah.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	52	11	Then he blinded the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him with bronze fetters and brought him to Babylon and put him in prison until the day of his death.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	52	12	Now on the tenth day of the fifth month, which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard, who was in the service of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	52	13	He burned the house of the LORD, the king's house and all the houses of Jerusalem; even every large house he burned with fire.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	52	14	So all the army of the Chaldeans who were with the captain of the guard broke down all the walls around Jerusalem.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	52	15	Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away into exile some of the poorest of the people, the rest of the people who were left in the city, the deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon and the rest of the artisans.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	52	16	But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and plowmen.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	52	17	Now the bronze pillars which belonged to the house of the LORD and the stands and the bronze sea, which were in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke in pieces and carried all their bronze to Babylon.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	52	18	They also took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the basins, the pans and all the bronze vessels which were used in temple service.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	52	19	The captain of the guard also took away the bowls, the firepans, the basins, the pots, the lampstands, the pans and the drink offering bowls, what was fine gold and what was fine silver.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	52	20	The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve bronze bulls that were under the sea, and the stands, which King Solomon had made for the house of the LORD--the bronze of all these vessels was beyond weight.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	52	21	As for the pillars, the height of each pillar was eighteen cubits, and it was twelve cubits in circumference and four fingers in thickness, and hollow.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	52	22	Now a capital of bronze was on it; and the height of each capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the capital all around, all of bronze. And the second pillar was like these, including pomegranates.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	52	23	There were ninety-six exposed pomegranates; all the pomegranates numbered a hundred on the network all around.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	52	24	Then the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest and Zephaniah the second priest, with the three officers of the temple.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	52	25	He also took from the city one official who was overseer of the men of war, and seven of the king's advisers who were found in the city, and the scribe of the commander of the army who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the midst of the city.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	52	26	Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	52	27	Then the king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was led away into exile from its land.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	52	28	These are the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away into exile: in the seventh year 3,Jews;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	52	29	in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar persons from Jerusalem;
Jeremiah	Jer	24	52	30	in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried into exile Jewish people; there were 4,600 persons in all.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	52	31	Now it came about in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, showed favor to Jehoiachin king of Judah and brought him out of prison.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	52	32	Then he spoke kindly to him and set his throne above the thrones of the kings who were with him in Babylon.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	52	33	So Jehoiachin changed his prison clothes, and had his meals in the king's presence regularly all the days of his life.
Jeremiah	Jer	24	52	34	For his allowance, a regular allowance was given him by the king of Babylon, a daily portion all the days of his life until the day of his death.
Lamentations	Lam	25	1	1	How lonely sits the city That was full of people! She has become like a widow Who was once great among the nations! She who was a princess among the provinces Has become a forced laborer!
Lamentations	Lam	25	1	2	She weeps bitterly in the night And her tears are on her cheeks; She has none to comfort her Among all her lovers. All her friends have dealt treacherously with her; They have become her enemies.
Lamentations	Lam	25	1	3	Judah has gone into exile under affliction And under harsh servitude; She dwells among the nations, But she has found no rest; All her pursuers have overtaken her In the midst of distress.
Lamentations	Lam	25	1	4	The roads of Zion are in mourning Because no one comes to the appointed feasts. All her gates are desolate; Her priests are groaning, Her virgins are afflicted, And she herself is bitter.
Lamentations	Lam	25	1	5	Her adversaries have become her masters, Her enemies prosper; For the LORD has caused her grief Because of the multitude of her transgressions; Her little ones have gone away As captives before the adversary.
Lamentations	Lam	25	1	6	All her majesty Has departed from the daughter of Zion; Her princes have become like deer That have found no pasture; And they have fled without strength Before the pursuer.
Lamentations	Lam	25	1	7	In the days of her affliction and homelessness Jerusalem remembers all her precious things That were from the days of old, When her people fell into the hand of the adversary And no one helped her. The adversaries saw her, They mocked at her ruin.
Lamentations	Lam	25	1	8	Jerusalem sinned greatly, Therefore she has become an unclean thing. All who honored her despise her Because they have seen her nakedness; Even she herself groans and turns away.
Lamentations	Lam	25	1	9	Her uncleanness was in her skirts; She did not consider her future. Therefore she has fallen astonishingly; She has no comforter. "See, O LORD, my affliction, For the enemy has magnified himself!"
Lamentations	Lam	25	1	10	The adversary has stretched out his hand Over all her precious things, For she has seen the nations enter her sanctuary, The ones whom You commanded That they should not enter into Your congregation.
Lamentations	Lam	25	1	11	All her people groan seeking bread; They have given their precious things for food To restore their lives themselves. "See, O LORD, and look, For I am despised."
Lamentations	Lam	25	1	12	"Is it nothing to all you who pass this way? Look and see if there is any pain like my pain Which was severely dealt out to me, Which the LORD inflicted on the day of His fierce anger.
Lamentations	Lam	25	1	13	"From on high He sent fire into my bones, And it prevailed over them. He has spread a net for my feet; He has turned me back; He has made me desolate, Faint all day long.
Lamentations	Lam	25	1	14	"The yoke of my transgressions is bound; By His hand they are knit together. They have come upon my neck; He has made my strength fail. The Lord has given me into the hands Of those against whom I am not able to stand.
Lamentations	Lam	25	1	15	"The Lord has rejected all my strong men In my midst; He has called an appointed time against me To crush my young men; The Lord has trodden as in a wine press The virgin daughter of Judah.
Lamentations	Lam	25	1	16	"For these things I weep; My eyes run down with water; Because far from me is a comforter, One who restores my soul. My children are desolate Because the enemy has prevailed."
Lamentations	Lam	25	1	17	Zion stretches out her hands; There is no one to comfort her; The LORD has commanded concerning Jacob That the ones round about him should be his adversaries; Jerusalem has become an unclean thing among them.
Lamentations	Lam	25	1	18	"The LORD is righteous; For I have rebelled against His command; Hear now, all peoples, And behold my pain; My virgins and my young men Have gone into captivity.
Lamentations	Lam	25	1	19	"I called to my lovers, but they deceived me; My priests and my elders perished in the city While they sought food to restore their strength themselves.
Lamentations	Lam	25	1	20	"See, O LORD, for I am in distress; My spirit is greatly troubled; My heart is overturned within me, For I have been very rebellious. In the street the sword slays; In the house it is like death.
Lamentations	Lam	25	1	21	"They have heard that I groan; There is no one to comfort me; All my enemies have heard of my calamity; They are glad that You have done it. Oh, that You would bring the day which You have proclaimed, That they may become like me.
Lamentations	Lam	25	1	22	"Let all their wickedness come before You; And deal with them as You have dealt with me For all my transgressions; For my groans are many and my heart is faint."
Lamentations	Lam	25	2	1	How the Lord has covered the daughter of Zion With a cloud in His anger! He has cast from heaven to earth The glory of Israel, And has not remembered His footstool In the day of His anger.
Lamentations	Lam	25	2	2	The Lord has swallowed up; He has not spared All the habitations of Jacob. In His wrath He has thrown down The strongholds of the daughter of Judah; He has brought them down to the ground; He has profaned the kingdom and its princes.
Lamentations	Lam	25	2	3	In fierce anger He has cut off All the strength of Israel; He has drawn back His right hand From before the enemy. And He has burned in Jacob like a flaming fire Consuming round about.
Lamentations	Lam	25	2	4	He has bent His bow like an enemy; He has set His right hand like an adversary And slain all that were pleasant to the eye; In the tent of the daughter of Zion He has poured out His wrath like fire.
Lamentations	Lam	25	2	5	The Lord has become like an enemy. He has swallowed up Israel; He has swallowed up all its palaces, He has destroyed its strongholds And multiplied in the daughter of Judah Mourning and moaning.
Lamentations	Lam	25	2	6	And He has violently treated His tabernacle like a garden booth; He has destroyed His appointed meeting place. The LORD has caused to be forgotten The appointed feast and sabbath in Zion, And He has despised king and priest In the indignation of His anger.
Lamentations	Lam	25	2	7	The Lord has rejected His altar, He has abandoned His sanctuary; He has delivered into the hand of the enemy The walls of her palaces. They have made a noise in the house of the LORD As in the day of an appointed feast.
Lamentations	Lam	25	2	8	The LORD determined to destroy The wall of the daughter of Zion. He has stretched out a line, He has not restrained His hand from destroying, And He has caused rampart and wall to lament; They have languished together.
Lamentations	Lam	25	2	9	Her gates have sunk into the ground, He has destroyed and broken her bars. Her king and her princes are among the nations; The law is no more. Also, her prophets find No vision from the LORD.
Lamentations	Lam	25	2	10	The elders of the daughter of Zion Sit on the ground, they are silent. They have thrown dust on their heads; They have girded themselves with sackcloth. The virgins of Jerusalem Have bowed their heads to the ground.
Lamentations	Lam	25	2	11	My eyes fail because of tears, My spirit is greatly troubled; My heart is poured out on the earth Because of the destruction of the daughter of my people, When little ones and infants faint In the streets of the city.
Lamentations	Lam	25	2	12	They say to their mothers, "Where is grain and wine?" As they faint like a wounded man In the streets of the city, As their life is poured out On their mothers' bosom.
Lamentations	Lam	25	2	13	How shall I admonish you? To what shall I compare you, O daughter of Jerusalem? To what shall I liken you as I comfort you, O virgin daughter of Zion? For your ruin is as vast as the sea; Who can heal you?
Lamentations	Lam	25	2	14	Your prophets have seen for you False and foolish visions; And they have not exposed your iniquity So as to restore you from captivity, But they have seen for you false and misleading oracles.
Lamentations	Lam	25	2	15	All who pass along the way Clap their hands in derision at you; They hiss and shake their heads At the daughter of Jerusalem, "Is this the city of which they said, 'The perfection of beauty, A joy to all the earth'?"
Lamentations	Lam	25	2	16	All your enemies Have opened their mouths wide against you; They hiss and gnash their teeth. They say, "We have swallowed her up! Surely this is the day for which we waited; We have reached it, we have seen it."
Lamentations	Lam	25	2	17	The LORD has done what He purposed; He has accomplished His word Which He commanded from days of old. He has thrown down without sparing, And He has caused the enemy to rejoice over you; He has exalted the might of your adversaries.
Lamentations	Lam	25	2	18	Their heart cried out to the Lord, "O wall of the daughter of Zion, Let your tears run down like a river day and night; Give yourself no relief, Let your eyes have no rest.
Lamentations	Lam	25	2	19	"Arise, cry aloud in the night At the beginning of the night watches; Pour out your heart like water Before the presence of the Lord; Lift up your hands to Him For the life of your little ones Who are faint because of hunger At the head of every street."
Lamentations	Lam	25	2	20	See, O LORD, and look! With whom have You dealt thus? Should women eat their offspring, The little ones who were born healthy? Should priest and prophet be slain In the sanctuary of the Lord?
Lamentations	Lam	25	2	21	On the ground in the streets Lie young and old; My virgins and my young men Have fallen by the sword. You have slain them in the day of Your anger, You have slaughtered, not sparing.
Lamentations	Lam	25	2	22	You called as in the day of an appointed feast My terrors on every side; And there was no one who escaped or survived In the day of the LORD'S anger. Those whom I bore and reared, My enemy annihilated them.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	1	I am the man who has seen affliction Because of the rod of His wrath.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	2	He has driven me and made me walk In darkness and not in light.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	3	Surely against me He has turned His hand Repeatedly all the day.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	4	He has caused my flesh and my skin to waste away, He has broken my bones.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	5	He has besieged and encompassed me with bitterness and hardship.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	6	In dark places He has made me dwell, Like those who have long been dead.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	7	He has walled me in so that I cannot go out; He has made my chain heavy.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	8	Even when I cry out and call for help, He shuts out my prayer.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	9	He has blocked my ways with hewn stone; He has made my paths crooked.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	10	He is to me like a bear lying in wait, Like a lion in secret places.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	11	He has turned aside my ways and torn me to pieces; He has made me desolate.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	12	He bent His bow And set me as a target for the arrow.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	13	He made the arrows of His quiver To enter into my inward parts.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	14	I have become a laughingstock to all my people, Their mocking song all the day.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	15	He has filled me with bitterness, He has made me drunk with wormwood.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	16	He has broken my teeth with gravel; He has made me cower in the dust.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	17	My soul has been rejected from peace; I have forgotten happiness.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	18	So I say, "My strength has perished, And so has my hope from the LORD."
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	19	Remember my affliction and my wandering, the wormwood and bitterness.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	20	Surely my soul remembers And is bowed down within me.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	21	This I recall to my mind, Therefore I have hope.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	22	The LORD'S lovingkindnesses indeed never cease, For His compassions never fail.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	23	They are new every morning; Great is Your faithfulness.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	24	"The LORD is my portion," says my soul, "Therefore I have hope in Him."
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	25	The LORD is good to those who wait for Him, To the person who seeks Him.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	26	It is good that he waits silently For the salvation of the LORD.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	27	It is good for a man that he should bear The yoke in his youth.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	28	Let him sit alone and be silent Since He has laid it on him.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	29	Let him put his mouth in the dust, Perhaps there is hope.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	30	Let him give his cheek to the smiter, Let him be filled with reproach.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	31	For the Lord will not reject forever,
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	32	For if He causes grief, Then He will have compassion According to His abundant lovingkindness.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	33	For He does not afflict willingly Or grieve the sons of men.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	34	To crush under His feet All the prisoners of the land,
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	35	To deprive a man of justice In the presence of the Most High,
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	36	To defraud a man in his lawsuit-- Of these things the Lord does not approve.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	37	Who is there who speaks and it comes to pass, Unless the Lord has commanded it?
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	38	Is it not from the mouth of the Most High That both good and ill go forth?
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	39	Why should any living mortal, or any man, Offer complaint in view of his sins?
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	40	Let us examine and probe our ways, And let us return to the LORD.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	41	We lift up our heart and hands Toward God in heaven;
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	42	We have transgressed and rebelled, You have not pardoned.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	43	You have covered Yourself with anger And pursued us; You have slain and have not spared.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	44	You have covered Yourself with a cloud So that no prayer can pass through.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	45	You have made us mere offscouring and refuse In the midst of the peoples.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	46	All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	47	Panic and pitfall have befallen us, Devastation and destruction;
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	48	My eyes run down with streams of water Because of the destruction of the daughter of my people.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	49	My eyes pour down unceasingly, Without stopping,
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	50	Until the LORD looks down And sees from heaven.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	51	My eyes bring pain to my soul Because of all the daughters of my city.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	52	My enemies without cause Hunted me down like a bird;
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	53	They have silenced me in the pit And have placed a stone on me.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	54	Waters flowed over my head; I said, "I am cut off!"
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	55	I called on Your name, O LORD, Out of the lowest pit.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	56	You have heard my voice, "Do not hide Your ear from my prayer for relief, From my cry for help."
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	57	You drew near when I called on You; You said, "Do not fear!"
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	58	O Lord, You have pleaded my soul's cause; You have redeemed my life.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	59	O LORD, You have seen my oppression; Judge my case.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	60	You have seen all their vengeance, All their schemes against me.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	61	You have heard their reproach, O LORD, All their schemes against me.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	62	The lips of my assailants and their whispering Are against me all day long.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	63	Look on their sitting and their rising; I am their mocking song.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	64	You will recompense them, O LORD, According to the work of their hands.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	65	You will give them hardness of heart, Your curse will be on them.
Lamentations	Lam	25	3	66	You will pursue them in anger and destroy them From under the heavens of the LORD!
Lamentations	Lam	25	4	1	How dark the gold has become, How the pure gold has changed! The sacred stones are poured out At the corner of every street.
Lamentations	Lam	25	4	2	The precious sons of Zion, Weighed against fine gold, How they are regarded as earthen jars, The work of a potter's hands!
Lamentations	Lam	25	4	3	Even jackals offer the breast, They nurse their young; But the daughter of my people has become cruel Like ostriches in the wilderness.
Lamentations	Lam	25	4	4	The tongue of the infant cleaves To the roof of its mouth because of thirst; The little ones ask for bread, But no one breaks it for them.
Lamentations	Lam	25	4	5	Those who ate delicacies Are desolate in the streets; Those reared in purple Embrace ash pits.
Lamentations	Lam	25	4	6	For the iniquity of the daughter of my people Is greater than the sin of Sodom, Which was overthrown as in a moment, And no hands were turned toward her.
Lamentations	Lam	25	4	7	Her consecrated ones were purer than snow, They were whiter than milk; They were more ruddy in body than corals, Their polishing was like lapis lazuli.
Lamentations	Lam	25	4	8	Their appearance is blacker than soot, They are not recognized in the streets; Their skin is shriveled on their bones, It is withered, it has become like wood.
Lamentations	Lam	25	4	9	Better are those slain with the sword Than those slain with hunger; For they pine away, being stricken For lack of the fruits of the field.
Lamentations	Lam	25	4	10	The hands of compassionate women Boiled their own children; They became food for them Because of the destruction of the daughter of my people.
Lamentations	Lam	25	4	11	The LORD has accomplished His wrath, He has poured out His fierce anger; And He has kindled a fire in Zion Which has consumed its foundations.
Lamentations	Lam	25	4	12	The kings of the earth did not believe, Nor did any of the inhabitants of the world, That the adversary and the enemy Could enter the gates of Jerusalem.
Lamentations	Lam	25	4	13	Because of the sins of her prophets And the iniquities of her priests, Who have shed in her midst The blood of the righteous;
Lamentations	Lam	25	4	14	They wandered, blind, in the streets; They were defiled with blood So that no one could touch their garments.
Lamentations	Lam	25	4	15	"Depart! Unclean!" they cried of themselves. "Depart, depart, do not touch!" So they fled and wandered; Men among the nations said, "They shall not continue to dwell with us."
Lamentations	Lam	25	4	16	The presence of the LORD has scattered them, He will not continue to regard them; They did not honor the priests, They did not favor the elders.
Lamentations	Lam	25	4	17	Yet our eyes failed, Looking for help was useless; In our watching we have watched For a nation that could not save.
Lamentations	Lam	25	4	18	They hunted our steps So that we could not walk in our streets; Our end drew near, Our days were finished For our end had come.
Lamentations	Lam	25	4	19	Our pursuers were swifter Than the eagles of the sky; They chased us on the mountains, They waited in ambush for us in the wilderness.
Lamentations	Lam	25	4	20	The breath of our nostrils, the LORD'S anointed, Was captured in their pits, Of whom we had said, "Under his shadow We shall live among the nations."
Lamentations	Lam	25	4	21	Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, Who dwells in the land of Uz; But the cup will come around to you as well, You will become drunk and make yourself naked.
Lamentations	Lam	25	4	22	The punishment of your iniquity has been completed, O daughter of Zion; He will exile you no longer. But He will punish your iniquity, O daughter of Edom; He will expose your sins!
Lamentations	Lam	25	5	1	Remember, O LORD, what has befallen us; Look, and see our reproach!
Lamentations	Lam	25	5	2	Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, Our houses to aliens.
Lamentations	Lam	25	5	3	We have become orphans without a father, Our mothers are like widows.
Lamentations	Lam	25	5	4	We have to pay for our drinking water, Our wood comes to us at a price.
Lamentations	Lam	25	5	5	Our pursuers are at our necks; We are worn out, there is no rest for us.
Lamentations	Lam	25	5	6	We have submitted to Egypt and Assyria to get enough bread.
Lamentations	Lam	25	5	7	Our fathers sinned, and are no more; It is we who have borne their iniquities.
Lamentations	Lam	25	5	8	Slaves rule over us; There is no one to deliver us from their hand.
Lamentations	Lam	25	5	9	We get our bread at the risk of our lives Because of the sword in the wilderness.
Lamentations	Lam	25	5	10	Our skin has become as hot as an oven, Because of the burning heat of famine.
Lamentations	Lam	25	5	11	They ravished the women in Zion, The virgins in the cities of Judah.
Lamentations	Lam	25	5	12	Princes were hung by their hands; Elders were not respected.
Lamentations	Lam	25	5	13	Young men worked at the grinding mill, And youths stumbled under loads of wood.
Lamentations	Lam	25	5	14	Elders are gone from the gate, Young men from their music.
Lamentations	Lam	25	5	15	The joy of our hearts has ceased; Our dancing has been turned into mourning.
Lamentations	Lam	25	5	16	The crown has fallen from our head; Woe to us, for we have sinned!
Lamentations	Lam	25	5	17	Because of this our heart is faint, Because of these things our eyes are dim;
Lamentations	Lam	25	5	18	Because of Mount Zion which lies desolate, Foxes prowl in it.
Lamentations	Lam	25	5	19	You, O LORD, rule forever; Your throne is from generation to generation.
Lamentations	Lam	25	5	20	Why do You forget us forever? Why do You forsake us so long?
Lamentations	Lam	25	5	21	Restore us to You, O LORD, that we may be restored; Renew our days as of old,
Lamentations	Lam	25	5	22	Unless You have utterly rejected us And are exceedingly angry with us.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	1	1	Now it came about in the thirtieth year, on the fifth day of the fourth month, while I was by the river Chebar among the exiles, the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	1	2	(On the fifth of the month in the fifth year of King Jehoiachin's exile,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	1	3	the word of the LORD came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and there the hand of the LORD came upon him.)
Ezekiel	Eze	26	1	4	As I looked, behold, a storm wind was coming from the north, a great cloud with fire flashing forth continually and a bright light around it, and in its midst something like glowing metal in the midst of the fire.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	1	5	Within it there were figures resembling four living beings. And this was their appearance: they had human form.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	1	6	Each of them had four faces and four wings.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	1	7	Their legs were straight and their feet were like a calf's hoof, and they gleamed like burnished bronze.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	1	8	Under their wings on their four sides were human hands. As for the faces and wings of the four of them,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	1	9	their wings touched one another; their faces did not turn when they moved, each went straight forward.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	1	10	As for the form of their faces, each had the face of a man; all four had the face of a lion on the right and the face of a bull on the left, and all four had the face of an eagle.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	1	11	Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out above; each had two touching another being, and two covering their bodies.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	1	12	And each went straight forward; wherever the spirit was about to go, they would go, without turning as they went.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	1	13	In the midst of the living beings there was something that looked like burning coals of fire, like torches darting back and forth among the living beings. The fire was bright, and lightning was flashing from the fire.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	1	14	And the living beings ran to and fro like bolts of lightning.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	1	15	Now as I looked at the living beings, behold, there was one wheel on the earth beside the living beings, for each of the four of them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	1	16	The appearance of the wheels and their workmanship was like sparkling beryl, and all four of them had the same form, their appearance and workmanship being as if one wheel were within another.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	1	17	Whenever they moved, they moved in any of their four directions without turning as they moved.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	1	18	As for their rims they were lofty and awesome, and the rims of all four of them were full of eyes round about.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	1	19	Whenever the living beings moved, the wheels moved with them. And whenever the living beings rose from the earth, the wheels rose also.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	1	20	Wherever the spirit was about to go, they would go in that direction. And the wheels rose close beside them; for the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	1	21	Whenever those went, these went; and whenever those stood still, these stood still. And whenever those rose from the earth, the wheels rose close beside them; for the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	1	22	Now over the heads of the living beings there was something like an expanse, like the awesome gleam of crystal, spread out over their heads.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	1	23	Under the expanse their wings were stretched out straight, one toward the other; each one also had two wings covering its body on the one side and on the other.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	1	24	I also heard the sound of their wings like the sound of abundant waters as they went, like the voice of the Almighty, a sound of tumult like the sound of an army camp; whenever they stood still, they dropped their wings.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	1	25	And there came a voice from above the expanse that was over their heads; whenever they stood still, they dropped their wings.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	1	26	Now above the expanse that was over their heads there was something resembling a throne, like lapis lazuli in appearance; and on that which resembled a throne, high up, was a figure with the appearance of a man.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	1	27	Then I noticed from the appearance of His loins and upward something like glowing metal that looked like fire all around within it, and from the appearance of His loins and downward I saw something like fire; and there was a radiance around Him.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	1	28	As the appearance of the rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the appearance of the surrounding radiance. Such was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell on my face and heard a voice speaking.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	2	1	Then He said to me, "Son of man, stand on your feet that I may speak with you!"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	2	2	As He spoke to me the Spirit entered me and set me on my feet; and I heard Him speaking to me.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	2	3	Then He said to me, "Son of man, I am sending you to the sons of Israel, to a rebellious people who have rebelled against Me; they and their fathers have transgressed against Me to this very day.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	2	4	"I am sending you to them who are stubborn and obstinate children, and you shall say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD.'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	2	5	"As for them, whether they listen or not--for they are a rebellious house--they will know that a prophet has been among them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	2	6	"And you, son of man, neither fear them nor fear their words, though thistles and thorns are with you and you sit on scorpions; neither fear their words nor be dismayed at their presence, for they are a rebellious house.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	2	7	"But you shall speak My words to them whether they listen or not, for they are rebellious.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	2	8	"Now you, son of man, listen to what I am speaking to you; do not be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth and eat what I am giving you."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	2	9	Then I looked, and behold, a hand was extended to me; and lo, a scroll was in it.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	2	10	When He spread it out before me, it was written on the front and back, and written on it were lamentations, mourning and woe.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	3	1	Then He said to me, "Son of man, eat what you find; eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	3	2	So I opened my mouth, and He fed me this scroll.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	3	3	He said to me, "Son of man, feed your stomach and fill your body with this scroll which I am giving you." Then I ate it, and it was sweet as honey in my mouth.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	3	4	Then He said to me, "Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak with My words to them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	3	5	"For you are not being sent to a people of unintelligible speech or difficult language, but to the house of Israel,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	3	6	nor to many peoples of unintelligible speech or difficult language, whose words you cannot understand. But I have sent you to them who should listen to you;
Ezekiel	Eze	26	3	7	yet the house of Israel will not be willing to listen to you, since they are not willing to listen to Me. Surely the whole house of Israel is stubborn and obstinate.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	3	8	"Behold, I have made your face as hard as their faces and your forehead as hard as their foreheads.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	3	9	"Like emery harder than flint I have made your forehead. Do not be afraid of them or be dismayed before them, though they are a rebellious house."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	3	10	Moreover, He said to me, "Son of man, take into your heart all My words which I will speak to you and listen closely.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	3	11	"Go to the exiles, to the sons of your people, and speak to them and tell them, whether they listen or not, 'Thus says the Lord GOD.'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	3	12	Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard a great rumbling sound behind me, "Blessed be the glory of the LORD in His place."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	3	13	And I heard the sound of the wings of the living beings touching one another and the sound of the wheels beside them, even a great rumbling sound.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	3	14	So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away; and I went embittered in the rage of my spirit, and the hand of the LORD was strong on me.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	3	15	Then I came to the exiles who lived beside the river Chebar at Tel-abib, and I sat there seven days where they were living, causing consternation among them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	3	16	At the end of seven days the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	3	17	"Son of man, I have appointed you a watchman to the house of Israel; whenever you hear a word from My mouth, warn them from Me.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	3	18	"When I say to the wicked, 'You will surely die,' and you do not warn him or speak out to warn the wicked from his wicked way that he may live, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	3	19	"Yet if you have warned the wicked and he does not turn from his wickedness or from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered yourself.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	3	20	"Again, when a righteous man turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and I place an obstacle before him, he will die; since you have not warned him, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood I will require at your hand.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	3	21	"However, if you have warned the righteous man that the righteous should not sin and he does not sin, he shall surely live because he took warning; and you have delivered yourself."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	3	22	The hand of the LORD was on me there, and He said to me, "Get up, go out to the plain, and there I will speak to you."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	3	23	So I got up and went out to the plain; and behold, the glory of the LORD was standing there, like the glory which I saw by the river Chebar, and I fell on my face.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	3	24	The Spirit then entered me and made me stand on my feet, and He spoke with me and said to me, "Go, shut yourself up in your house.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	3	25	"As for you, son of man, they will put ropes on you and bind you with them so that you cannot go out among them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	3	26	"Moreover, I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be mute and cannot be a man who rebukes them, for they are a rebellious house.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	3	27	"But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth and you will say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD.' He who hears, let him hear; and he who refuses, let him refuse; for they are a rebellious house.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	4	1	"Now you son of man, get yourself a brick, place it before you and inscribe a city on it, Jerusalem.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	4	2	"Then lay siege against it, build a siege wall, raise up a ramp, pitch camps and place battering rams against it all around.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	4	3	"Then get yourself an iron plate and set it up as an iron wall between you and the city, and set your face toward it so that it is under siege, and besiege it. This is a sign to the house of Israel.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	4	4	"As for you, lie down on your left side and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel on it; you shall bear their iniquity for the number of days that you lie on it.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	4	5	"For I have assigned you a number of days corresponding to the years of their iniquity, three hundred and ninety days; thus you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	4	6	"When you have completed these, you shall lie down a second time, but on your right side and bear the iniquity of the house of Judah; I have assigned it to you for forty days, a day for each year.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	4	7	"Then you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem with your arm bared and prophesy against it.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	4	8	"Now behold, I will put ropes on you so that you cannot turn from one side to the other until you have completed the days of your siege.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	4	9	"But as for you, take wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet and spelt, put them in one vessel and make them into bread for yourself; you shall eat it according to the number of the days that you lie on your side, three hundred and ninety days.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	4	10	"Your food which you eat shall be twenty shekels a day by weight; you shall eat it from time to time.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	4	11	"The water you drink shall be the sixth part of a hin by measure; you shall drink it from time to time.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	4	12	"You shall eat it as a barley cake, having baked it in their sight over human dung."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	4	13	Then the LORD said, "Thus will the sons of Israel eat their bread unclean among the nations where I will banish them."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	4	14	But I said, "Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, I have never been defiled; for from my youth until now I have never eaten what died of itself or was torn by beasts, nor has any unclean meat ever entered my mouth."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	4	15	Then He said to me, "See, I will give you cow's dung in place of human dung over which you will prepare your bread."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	4	16	Moreover, He said to me, "Son of man, behold, I am going to break the staff of bread in Jerusalem, and they will eat bread by weight and with anxiety, and drink water by measure and in horror,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	4	17	because bread and water will be scarce; and they will be appalled with one another and waste away in their iniquity.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	5	1	"As for you, son of man, take a sharp sword; take and use it as a barber's razor on your head and beard. Then take scales for weighing and divide the hair.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	5	2	"One third you shall burn in the fire at the center of the city, when the days of the siege are completed. Then you shall take one third and strike it with the sword all around the city, and one third you shall scatter to the wind; and I will unsheathe a sword behind them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	5	3	"Take also a few in number from them and bind them in the edges of your robes.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	5	4	"Take again some of them and throw them into the fire and burn them in the fire; from it a fire will spread to all the house of Israel.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	5	5	"Thus says the Lord GOD, 'This is Jerusalem; I have set her at the center of the nations, with lands around her.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	5	6	'But she has rebelled against My ordinances more wickedly than the nations and against My statutes more than the lands which surround her; for they have rejected My ordinances and have not walked in My statutes.'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	5	7	"Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, 'Because you have more turmoil than the nations which surround you and have not walked in My statutes, nor observed My ordinances, nor observed the ordinances of the nations which surround you,'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	5	8	therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, 'Behold, I, even I, am against you, and I will execute judgments among you in the sight of the nations.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	5	9	'And because of all your abominations, I will do among you what I have not done, and the like of which I will never do again.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	5	10	'Therefore, fathers will eat their sons among you, and sons will eat their fathers; for I will execute judgments on you and scatter all your remnant to every wind.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	5	11	'So as I live,' declares the Lord GOD, 'surely, because you have defiled My sanctuary with all your detestable idols and with all your abominations, therefore I will also withdraw, and My eye will have no pity and I will not spare.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	5	12	'One third of you will die by plague or be consumed by famine among you, one third will fall by the sword around you, and one third I will scatter to every wind, and I will unsheathe a sword behind them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	5	13	'Thus My anger will be spent and I will satisfy My wrath on them, and I will be appeased; then they will know that I, the LORD, have spoken in My zeal when I have spent My wrath upon them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	5	14	'Moreover, I will make you a desolation and a reproach among the nations which surround you, in the sight of all who pass by.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	5	15	'So it will be a reproach, a reviling, a warning and an object of horror to the nations who surround you when I execute judgments against you in anger, wrath and raging rebukes. I, the LORD, have spoken.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	5	16	'When I send against them the deadly arrows of famine which were for the destruction of those whom I will send to destroy you, then I will also intensify the famine upon you and break the staff of bread.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	5	17	'Moreover, I will send on you famine and wild beasts, and they will bereave you of children; plague and bloodshed also will pass through you, and I will bring the sword on you. I, the LORD, have spoken.'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	6	1	And the word of the LORD came to me saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	6	2	"Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them
Ezekiel	Eze	26	6	3	and say, 'Mountains of Israel, listen to the word of the Lord GOD! Thus says the Lord GOD to the mountains, the hills, the ravines and the valleys: "Behold, I Myself am going to bring a sword on you, and I will destroy your high places.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	6	4	"So your altars will become desolate and your incense altars will be smashed; and I will make your slain fall in front of your idols.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	6	5	"I will also lay the dead bodies of the sons of Israel in front of their idols; and I will scatter your bones around your altars.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	6	6	"In all your dwellings, cities will become waste and the high places will be desolate, that your altars may become waste and desolate, your idols may be broken and brought to an end, your incense altars may be cut down, and your works may be blotted out.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	6	7	"The slain will fall among you, and you will know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	6	8	"However, I will leave a remnant, for you will have those who escaped the sword among the nations when you are scattered among the countries.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	6	9	"Then those of you who escape will remember Me among the nations to which they will be carried captive, how I have been hurt by their adulterous hearts which turned away from Me, and by their eyes which played the harlot after their idols; and they will loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils which they have committed, for all their abominations.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	6	10	"Then they will know that I am the LORD; I have not said in vain that I would inflict this disaster on them."'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	6	11	"Thus says the Lord GOD, 'Clap your hand, stamp your foot and say, "Alas, because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel, which will fall by sword, famine and plague!
Ezekiel	Eze	26	6	12	"He who is far off will die by the plague, and he who is near will fall by the sword, and he who remains and is besieged will die by the famine. Thus will I spend My wrath on them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	6	13	"Then you will know that I am the LORD, when their slain are among their idols around their altars, on every high hill, on all the tops of the mountains, under every green tree and under every leafy oak--the places where they offered soothing aroma to all their idols.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	6	14	"So throughout all their habitations I will stretch out My hand against them and make the land more desolate and waste than the wilderness toward Diblah; thus they will know that I am the LORD."'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	7	1	Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	7	2	"And you, son of man, thus says the Lord GOD to the land of Israel, 'An end! The end is coming on the four corners of the land.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	7	3	'Now the end is upon you, and I will send My anger against you; I will judge you according to your ways and bring all your abominations upon you.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	7	4	'For My eye will have no pity on you, nor will I spare you, but I will bring your ways upon you, and your abominations will be among you; then you will know that I am the LORD!'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	7	5	"Thus says the Lord GOD, 'A disaster, unique disaster, behold it is coming!
Ezekiel	Eze	26	7	6	'An end is coming; the end has come! It has awakened against you; behold, it has come!
Ezekiel	Eze	26	7	7	'Your doom has come to you, O inhabitant of the land. The time has come, the day is near--tumult rather than joyful shouting on the mountains.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	7	8	'Now I will shortly pour out My wrath on you and spend My anger against you; judge you according to your ways and bring on you all your abominations.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	7	9	'My eye will show no pity nor will I spare. I will repay you according to your ways, while your abominations are in your midst; then you will know that I, the LORD, do the smiting.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	7	10	'Behold, the day! Behold, it is coming! Your doom has gone forth; the rod has budded, arrogance has blossomed.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	7	11	'Violence has grown into a rod of wickedness. None of them shall remain, none of their people, none of their wealth, nor anything eminent among them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	7	12	'The time has come, the day has arrived. Let not the buyer rejoice nor the seller mourn; for wrath is against all their multitude.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	7	13	'Indeed, the seller will not regain what he sold as long as they both live; for the vision regarding all their multitude will not be averted, nor will any of them maintain his life by his iniquity.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	7	14	'They have blown the trumpet and made everything ready, but no one is going to the battle, for My wrath is against all their multitude.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	7	15	'The sword is outside and the plague and the famine are within. He who is in the field will die by the sword; famine and the plague will also consume those in the city.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	7	16	'Even when their survivors escape, they will be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, each over his own iniquity.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	7	17	'All hands will hang limp and all knees will become like water.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	7	18	'They will gird themselves with sackcloth and shuddering will overwhelm them; and shame will be on all faces and baldness on all their heads.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	7	19	'They will fling their silver into the streets and their gold will become an abhorrent thing; their silver and their gold will not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD. They cannot satisfy their appetite nor can they fill their stomachs, for their iniquity has become an occasion of stumbling.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	7	20	'They transformed the beauty of His ornaments into pride, and they made the images of their abominations and their detestable things with it; therefore I will make it an abhorrent thing to them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	7	21	'I will give it into the hands of the foreigners as plunder and to the wicked of the earth as spoil, and they will profane it.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	7	22	'I will also turn My face from them, and they will profane My secret place; then robbers will enter and profane it.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	7	23	'Make the chain, for the land is full of bloody crimes and the city is full of violence.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	7	24	'Therefore, I will bring the worst of the nations, and they will possess their houses. I will also make the pride of the strong ones cease, and their holy places will be profaned.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	7	25	'When anguish comes, they will seek peace, but there will be none.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	7	26	'Disaster will come upon disaster and rumor will be added to rumor; then they will seek a vision from a prophet, but the law will be lost from the priest and counsel from the elders.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	7	27	'The king will mourn, the prince will be clothed with horror, and the hands of the people of the land will tremble. According to their conduct I will deal with them, and by their judgments I will judge them. And they will know that I am the LORD.'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	8	1	It came about in the sixth year, on the fifth day of the sixth month, as I was sitting in my house with the elders of Judah sitting before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell on me there.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	8	2	Then I looked, and behold, a likeness as the appearance of a man; from His loins and downward there was the appearance of fire, and from His loins and upward the appearance of brightness, like the appearance of glowing metal.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	8	3	He stretched out the form of a hand and caught me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the north gate of the inner court, where the seat of the idol of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy, was located.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	8	4	And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the appearance which I saw in the plain.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	8	5	Then He said to me, "Son of man, raise your eyes now toward the north." So I raised my eyes toward the north, and behold, to the north of the altar gate was this idol of jealousy at the entrance.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	8	6	And He said to me, "Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great abominations which the house of Israel are committing here, so that I would be far from My sanctuary? But yet you will see still greater abominations."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	8	7	Then He brought me to the entrance of the court, and when I looked, behold, a hole in the wall.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	8	8	He said to me, "Son of man, now dig through the wall." So I dug through the wall, and behold, an entrance.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	8	9	And He said to me, "Go in and see the wicked abominations that they are committing here."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	8	10	So I entered and looked, and behold, every form of creeping things and beasts and detestable things, with all the idols of the house of Israel, were carved on the wall all around.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	8	11	Standing in front of them were seventy elders of the house of Israel, with Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan standing among them, each man with his censer in his hand and the fragrance of the cloud of incense rising.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	8	12	Then He said to me, "Son of man, do you see what the elders of the house of Israel are committing in the dark, each man in the room of his carved images? For they say, 'The LORD does not see us; the LORD has forsaken the land.'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	8	13	And He said to me, "Yet you will see still greater abominations which they are committing."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	8	14	Then He brought me to the entrance of the gate of the LORD'S house which was toward the north; and behold, women were sitting there weeping for Tammuz.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	8	15	He said to me, "Do you see this, son of man? Yet you will see still greater abominations than these."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	8	16	Then He brought me into the inner court of the LORD'S house. And behold, at the entrance to the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men with their backs to the temple of the LORD and their faces toward the east; and they were prostrating themselves eastward toward the sun.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	8	17	He said to me, "Do you see this, son of man? Is it too light a thing for the house of Judah to commit the abominations which they have committed here, that they have filled the land with violence and provoked Me repeatedly? For behold, they are putting the twig to their nose.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	8	18	"Therefore, I indeed will deal in wrath. My eye will have no pity nor will I spare; and though they cry in My ears with a loud voice, yet I will not listen to them."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	9	1	Then He cried out in my hearing with a loud voice saying, "Draw near, O executioners of the city, each with his destroying weapon in his hand."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	9	2	Behold, six men came from the direction of the upper gate which faces north, each with his shattering weapon in his hand; and among them was a certain man clothed in linen with a writing case at his loins. And they went in and stood beside the bronze altar.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	9	3	Then the glory of the God of Israel went up from the cherub on which it had been, to the threshold of the temple. And He called to the man clothed in linen at whose loins was the writing case.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	9	4	The LORD said to him, "Go through the midst of the city, even through the midst of Jerusalem, and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and groan over all the abominations which are being committed in its midst."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	9	5	But to the others He said in my hearing, "Go through the city after him and strike; do not let your eye have pity and do not spare.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	9	6	"Utterly slay old men, young men, maidens, little children, and women, but do not touch any man on whom is the mark; and you shall start from My sanctuary." So they started with the elders who were before the temple.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	9	7	And He said to them, "Defile the temple and fill the courts with the slain. Go out!" Thus they went out and struck down the people in the city.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	9	8	As they were striking the people and I alone was left, I fell on my face and cried out saying, "Alas, Lord GOD! Are You destroying the whole remnant of Israel by pouring out Your wrath on Jerusalem?"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	9	9	Then He said to me, "The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is very, very great, and the land is filled with blood and the city is full of perversion; for they say, 'The LORD has forsaken the land, and the LORD does not see!'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	9	10	"But as for Me, My eye will have no pity nor will I spare, but I will bring their conduct upon their heads."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	9	11	Then behold, the man clothed in linen at whose loins was the writing case reported, saying, "I have done just as You have commanded me."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	10	1	Then I looked, and behold, in the expanse that was over the heads of the cherubim something like a sapphire stone, in appearance resembling a throne, appeared above them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	10	2	And He spoke to the man clothed in linen and said, "Enter between the whirling wheels under the cherubim and fill your hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim and scatter them over the city." And he entered in my sight.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	10	3	Now the cherubim were standing on the right side of the temple when the man entered, and the cloud filled the inner court.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	10	4	Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub to the threshold of the temple, and the temple was filled with the cloud and the court was filled with the brightness of the glory of the LORD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	10	5	Moreover, the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as the outer court, like the voice of God Almighty when He speaks.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	10	6	It came about when He commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, "Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim," he entered and stood beside a wheel.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	10	7	Then the cherub stretched out his hand from between the cherubim to the fire which was between the cherubim, took some and put it into the hands of the one clothed in linen, who took it and went out.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	10	8	The cherubim appeared to have the form of a man's hand under their wings.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	10	9	Then I looked, and behold, four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside each cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like the gleam of a Tarshish stone.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	10	10	As for their appearance, all four of them had the same likeness, as if one wheel were within another wheel.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	10	11	When they moved, they went in any of their four directions without turning as they went; but they followed in the direction which they faced, without turning as they went.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	10	12	Their whole body, their backs, their hands, their wings and the wheels were full of eyes all around, the wheels belonging to all four of them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	10	13	The wheels were called in my hearing, the whirling wheels.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	10	14	And each one had four faces. The first face was the face of a cherub, the second face was the face of a man, the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	10	15	Then the cherubim rose up. They are the living beings that I saw by the river Chebar.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	10	16	Now when the cherubim moved, the wheels would go beside them; also when the cherubim lifted up their wings to rise from the ground, the wheels would not turn from beside them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	10	17	When the cherubim stood still, the wheels would stand still; and when they rose up, the wheels would rise with them, for the spirit of the living beings was in them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	10	18	Then the glory of the LORD departed from the threshold of the temple and stood over the cherubim.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	10	19	When the cherubim departed, they lifted their wings and rose up from the earth in my sight with the wheels beside them; and they stood still at the entrance of the east gate of the LORD'S house, and the glory of the God of Israel hovered over them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	10	20	These are the living beings that I saw beneath the God of Israel by the river Chebar; so I knew that they were cherubim.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	10	21	Each one had four faces and each one four wings, and beneath their wings was the form of human hands.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	10	22	As for the likeness of their faces, they were the same faces whose appearance I had seen by the river Chebar. Each one went straight ahead.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	11	1	Moreover, the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the east gate of the LORD'S house which faced eastward. And behold, there were twenty-five men at the entrance of the gate, and among them I saw Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, leaders of the people.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	11	2	He said to me, "Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity and give evil advice in this city,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	11	3	who say, 'The time is not near to build houses. This city is the pot and we are the flesh.'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	11	4	"Therefore, prophesy against them, son of man, prophesy!"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	11	5	Then the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and He said to me, "Say, 'Thus says the LORD, "So you think, house of Israel, for I know your thoughts.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	11	6	"You have multiplied your slain in this city, filling its streets with them."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	11	7	'Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, "Your slain whom you have laid in the midst of the city are the flesh and this city is the pot; but I will bring you out of it.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	11	8	"You have feared a sword; so I will bring a sword upon you," the Lord GOD declares.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	11	9	"And I will bring you out of the midst of the city and deliver you into the hands of strangers and execute judgments against you.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	11	10	"You will fall by the sword. I will judge you to the border of Israel; so you shall know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	11	11	"This city will not be a pot for you, nor will you be flesh in the midst of it, but I will judge you to the border of Israel.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	11	12	"Thus you will know that I am the LORD; for you have not walked in My statutes nor have you executed My ordinances, but have acted according to the ordinances of the nations around you."'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	11	13	Now it came about as I prophesied, that Pelatiah son of Benaiah died. Then I fell on my face and cried out with a loud voice and said, "Alas, Lord GOD! Will You bring the remnant of Israel to a complete end?"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	11	14	Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	11	15	"Son of man, your brothers, your relatives, your fellow exiles and the whole house of Israel, all of them, are those to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, 'Go far from the LORD; this land has been given us as a possession.'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	11	16	"Therefore say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Though I had removed them far away among the nations and though I had scattered them among the countries, yet I was a sanctuary for them a little while in the countries where they had gone."'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	11	17	"Therefore say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "I will gather you from the peoples and assemble you out of the countries among which you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel."'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	11	18	"When they come there, they will remove all its detestable things and all its abominations from it.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	11	19	"And I will give them one heart, and put a new spirit within them. And I will take the heart of stone out of their flesh and give them a heart of flesh,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	11	20	that they may walk in My statutes and keep My ordinances and do them. Then they will be My people, and I shall be their God.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	11	21	"But as for those whose hearts go after their detestable things and abominations, I will bring their conduct down on their heads," declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	11	22	Then the cherubim lifted up their wings with the wheels beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel hovered over them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	11	23	The glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city and stood over the mountain which is east of the city.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	11	24	And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God to the exiles in Chaldea. So the vision that I had seen left me.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	11	25	Then I told the exiles all the things that the LORD had shown me.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	12	1	Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	12	2	"Son of man, you live in the midst of the rebellious house, who have eyes to see but do not see, ears to hear but do not hear; for they are a rebellious house.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	12	3	"Therefore, son of man, prepare for yourself baggage for exile and go into exile by day in their sight; even go into exile from your place to another place in their sight. Perhaps they will understand though they are a rebellious house.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	12	4	"Bring your baggage out by day in their sight, as baggage for exile. Then you will go out at evening in their sight, as those going into exile.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	12	5	"Dig a hole through the wall in their sight and go out through it.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	12	6	"Load the baggage on your shoulder in their sight and carry it out in the dark. You shall cover your face so that you cannot see the land, for I have set you as a sign to the house of Israel."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	12	7	I did so, as I had been commanded. By day I brought out my baggage like the baggage of an exile. Then in the evening I dug through the wall with my hands; I went out in the dark and carried the baggage on my shoulder in their sight.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	12	8	In the morning the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	12	9	"Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, 'What are you doing?'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	12	10	"Say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "This burden concerns the prince in Jerusalem as well as all the house of Israel who are in it."'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	12	11	"Say, 'I am a sign to you. As I have done, so it will be done to them; they will go into exile, into captivity.'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	12	12	"The prince who is among them will load his baggage on his shoulder in the dark and go out. They will dig a hole through the wall to bring it out. He will cover his face so that he can not see the land with his eyes.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	12	13	"I will also spread My net over him, and he will be caught in My snare. And I will bring him to Babylon in the land of the Chaldeans; yet he will not see it, though he will die there.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	12	14	"I will scatter to every wind all who are around him, his helpers and all his troops; and I will draw out a sword after them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	12	15	"So they will know that I am the LORD when I scatter them among the nations and spread them among the countries.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	12	16	"But I will spare a few of them from the sword, the famine and the pestilence that they may tell all their abominations among the nations where they go, and may know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	12	17	Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	12	18	"Son of man, eat your bread with trembling and drink your water with quivering and anxiety.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	12	19	"Then say to the people of the land, 'Thus says the Lord GOD concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the land of Israel, "They will eat their bread with anxiety and drink their water with horror, because their land will be stripped of its fullness on account of the violence of all who live in it.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	12	20	"The inhabited cities will be laid waste and the land will be a desolation. So you will know that I am the LORD."'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	12	21	Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	12	22	"Son of man, what is this proverb you people have concerning the land of Israel, saying, 'The days are long and every vision fails'?
Ezekiel	Eze	26	12	23	"Therefore say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "I will make this proverb cease so that they will no longer use it as a proverb in Israel." But tell them, "The days draw near as well as the fulfillment of every vision.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	12	24	"For there will no longer be any false vision or flattering divination within the house of Israel.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	12	25	"For I the LORD will speak, and whatever word I speak will be performed. It will no longer be delayed, for in your days, O rebellious house, I will speak the word and perform it," declares the Lord GOD.'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	12	26	Furthermore, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	12	27	"Son of man, behold, the house of Israel is saying, 'The vision that he sees is for many years from now, and he prophesies of times far off.'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	12	28	"Therefore say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "None of My words will be delayed any longer. Whatever word I speak will be performed,"'" declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	13	1	Then the word of the LORD came to me saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	13	2	"Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy, and say to those who prophesy from their own inspiration, 'Listen to the word of the LORD!
Ezekiel	Eze	26	13	3	'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Woe to the foolish prophets who are following their own spirit and have seen nothing.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	13	4	"O Israel, your prophets have been like foxes among ruins.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	13	5	"You have not gone up into the breaches, nor did you build the wall around the house of Israel to stand in the battle on the day of the LORD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	13	6	"They see falsehood and lying divination who are saying, 'The LORD declares,' when the LORD has not sent them; yet they hope for the fulfillment of their word.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	13	7	"Did you not see a false vision and speak a lying divination when you said, 'The LORD declares,' but it is not I who have spoken?"'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	13	8	Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, "Because you have spoken falsehood and seen a lie, therefore behold, I am against you," declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	13	9	"So My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and utter lying divinations. They will have no place in the council of My people, nor will they be written down in the register of the house of Israel, nor will they enter the land of Israel, that you may know that I am the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	13	10	"It is definitely because they have misled My people by saying, 'Peace!' when there is no peace. And when anyone builds a wall, behold, they plaster it over with whitewash;
Ezekiel	Eze	26	13	11	so tell those who plaster it over with whitewash, that it will fall. A flooding rain will come, and you, O hailstones, will fall; and a violent wind will break out.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	13	12	"Behold, when the wall has fallen, will you not be asked, 'Where is the plaster with which you plastered it?'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	13	13	Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, "I will make a violent wind break out in My wrath. There will also be in My anger a flooding rain and hailstones to consume it in wrath.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	13	14	"So I will tear down the wall which you plastered over with whitewash and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation is laid bare; and when it falls, you will be consumed in its midst. And you will know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	13	15	"Thus I will spend My wrath on the wall and on those who have plastered it over with whitewash; and I will say to you, 'The wall is gone and its plasterers are gone,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	13	16	along with the prophets of Israel who prophesy to Jerusalem, and who see visions of peace for her when there is no peace,' declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	13	17	"Now you, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people who are prophesying from their own inspiration. Prophesy against them
Ezekiel	Eze	26	13	18	and say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Woe to the women who sew magic bands on all wrists and make veils for the heads of persons of every stature to hunt down lives! Will you hunt down the lives of My people, but preserve the lives of others for yourselves?
Ezekiel	Eze	26	13	19	"For handfuls of barley and fragments of bread, you have profaned Me to My people to put to death some who should not die and to keep others alive who should not live, by your lying to My people who listen to lies."'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	13	20	Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I am against your magic bands by which you hunt lives there as birds and I will tear them from your arms; and I will let them go, even those lives whom you hunt as birds.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	13	21	"I will also tear off your veils and deliver My people from your hands, and they will no longer be in your hands to be hunted; and you will know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	13	22	"Because you disheartened the righteous with falsehood when I did not cause him grief, but have encouraged the wicked not to turn from his wicked way and preserve his life,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	13	23	therefore, you women will no longer see false visions or practice divination, and I will deliver My people out of your hand. Thus you will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	14	1	Then some elders of Israel came to me and sat down before me.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	14	2	And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	14	3	"Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their hearts and have put right before their faces the stumbling block of their iniquity. Should I be consulted by them at all?
Ezekiel	Eze	26	14	4	"Therefore speak to them and tell them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Any man of the house of Israel who sets up his idols in his heart, puts right before his face the stumbling block of his iniquity, and then comes to the prophet, I the LORD will be brought to give him an answer in the matter in view of the multitude of his idols,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	14	5	in order to lay hold of the hearts of the house of Israel who are estranged from Me through all their idols."'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	14	6	"Therefore say to the house of Israel, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Repent and turn away from your idols and turn your faces away from all your abominations.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	14	7	"For anyone of the house of Israel or of the immigrants who stay in Israel who separates himself from Me, sets up his idols in his heart, puts right before his face the stumbling block of his iniquity, and then comes to the prophet to inquire of Me for himself, I the LORD will be brought to answer him in My own person.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	14	8	"I will set My face against that man and make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from among My people. So you will know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	14	9	"But if the prophet is prevailed upon to speak a word, it is I, the LORD, who have prevailed upon that prophet, and I will stretch out My hand against him and destroy him from among My people Israel.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	14	10	"They will bear the punishment of their iniquity; as the iniquity of the inquirer is, so the iniquity of the prophet will be,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	14	11	in order that the house of Israel may no longer stray from Me and no longer defile themselves with all their transgressions. Thus they will be My people, and I shall be their God,"' declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	14	12	Then the word of the LORD came to me saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	14	13	"Son of man, if a country sins against Me by committing unfaithfulness, and I stretch out My hand against it, destroy its supply of bread, send famine against it and cut off from it both man and beast,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	14	14	even though these three men, Noah, Daniel and Job were in its midst, by their own righteousness they could only deliver themselves," declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	14	15	"If I were to cause wild beasts to pass through the land and they depopulated it, and it became desolate so that no one would pass through it because of the beasts,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	14	16	though these three men were in its midst, as I live," declares the Lord GOD, "they could not deliver either their sons or their daughters. They alone would be delivered, but the country would be desolate.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	14	17	"Or if I should bring a sword on that country and say, 'Let the sword pass through the country and cut off man and beast from it,'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	14	18	even though these three men were in its midst, as I live," declares the Lord GOD, "they could not deliver either their sons or their daughters, but they alone would be delivered.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	14	19	"Or if I should send a plague against that country and pour out My wrath in blood on it to cut off man and beast from it,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	14	20	even though Noah, Daniel and Job were in its midst, as I live," declares the Lord GOD, "they could not deliver either their son or their daughter. They would deliver only themselves by their righteousness."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	14	21	For thus says the Lord GOD, "How much more when I send My four severe judgments against Jerusalem: sword, famine, wild beasts and plague to cut off man and beast from it!
Ezekiel	Eze	26	14	22	"Yet, behold, survivors will be left in it who will be brought out, both sons and daughters. Behold, they are going to come forth to you and you will see their conduct and actions; then you will be comforted for the calamity which I have brought against Jerusalem for everything which I have brought upon it.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	14	23	"Then they will comfort you when you see their conduct and actions, for you will know that I have not done in vain whatever I did to it," declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	15	1	Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	15	2	"Son of man, how is the wood of the vine better than any wood of a branch which is among the trees of the forest?
Ezekiel	Eze	26	15	3	"Can wood be taken from it to make anything, or can men take a peg from it on which to hang any vessel?
Ezekiel	Eze	26	15	4	"If it has been put into the fire for fuel, and the fire has consumed both of its ends and its middle part has been charred, is it then useful for anything?
Ezekiel	Eze	26	15	5	"Behold, while it is intact, it is not made into anything. How much less, when the fire has consumed it and it is charred, can it still be made into anything!
Ezekiel	Eze	26	15	6	"Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, 'As the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so have I given up the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
Ezekiel	Eze	26	15	7	and I set My face against them. Though they have come out of the fire, yet the fire will consume them. Then you will know that I am the LORD, when I set My face against them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	15	8	'Thus I will make the land desolate, because they have acted unfaithfully,'" declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	1	Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	2	"Son of man, make known to Jerusalem her abominations
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	3	and say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD to Jerusalem, "Your origin and your birth are from the land of the Canaanite, your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	4	"As for your birth, on the day you were born your navel cord was not cut, nor were you washed with water for cleansing; you were not rubbed with salt or even wrapped in cloths.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	5	"No eye looked with pity on you to do any of these things for you, to have compassion on you. Rather you were thrown out into the open field, for you were abhorred on the day you were born.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	6	"When I passed by you and saw you squirming in your blood, I said to you while you were in your blood, 'Live!' Yes, I said to you while you were in your blood, 'Live!'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	7	"I made you numerous like plants of the field. Then you grew up, became tall and reached the age for fine ornaments; your breasts were formed and your hair had grown. Yet you were naked and bare.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	8	"Then I passed by you and saw you, and behold, you were at the time for love; so I spread My skirt over you and covered your nakedness. I also swore to you and entered into a covenant with you so that you became Mine," declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	9	"Then I bathed you with water, washed off your blood from you and anointed you with oil.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	10	"I also clothed you with embroidered cloth and put sandals of porpoise skin on your feet; and I wrapped you with fine linen and covered you with silk.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	11	"I adorned you with ornaments, put bracelets on your hands and a necklace around your neck.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	12	"I also put a ring in your nostril, earrings in your ears and a beautiful crown on your head.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	13	"Thus you were adorned with gold and silver, and your dress was of fine linen, silk and embroidered cloth. You ate fine flour, honey and oil; so you were exceedingly beautiful and advanced to royalty.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	14	"Then your fame went forth among the nations on account of your beauty, for it was perfect because of My splendor which I bestowed on you," declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	15	"But you trusted in your beauty and played the harlot because of your fame, and you poured out your harlotries on every passer-by who might be willing.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	16	"You took some of your clothes, made for yourself high places of various colors and played the harlot on them, which should never come about nor happen.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	17	"You also took your beautiful jewels made of My gold and of My silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself male images that you might play the harlot with them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	18	"Then you took your embroidered cloth and covered them, and offered My oil and My incense before them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	19	"Also My bread which I gave you, fine flour, oil and honey with which I fed you, you would offer before them for a soothing aroma; so it happened," declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	20	"Moreover, you took your sons and daughters whom you had borne to Me and sacrificed them to idols to be devoured. Were your harlotries so small a matter?
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	21	"You slaughtered My children and offered them up to idols by causing them to pass through the fire.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	22	"Besides all your abominations and harlotries you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare and squirming in your blood.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	23	"Then it came about after all your wickedness ('Woe, woe to you!' declares the Lord GOD),
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	24	that you built yourself a shrine and made yourself a high place in every square.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	25	"You built yourself a high place at the top of every street and made your beauty abominable, and you spread your legs to every passer-by to multiply your harlotry.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	26	"You also played the harlot with the Egyptians, your lustful neighbors, and multiplied your harlotry to make Me angry.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	27	"Behold now, I have stretched out My hand against you and diminished your rations. And I delivered you up to the desire of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who are ashamed of your lewd conduct.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	28	"Moreover, you played the harlot with the Assyrians because you were not satisfied; you played the harlot with them and still were not satisfied.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	29	"You also multiplied your harlotry with the land of merchants, Chaldea, yet even with this you were not satisfied."'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	30	"How languishing is your heart," declares the Lord GOD, "while you do all these things, the actions of a bold-faced harlot.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	31	"When you built your shrine at the beginning of every street and made your high place in every square, in disdaining money, you were not like a harlot.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	32	"You adulteress wife, who takes strangers instead of her husband!
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	33	"Men give gifts to all harlots, but you give your gifts to all your lovers to bribe them to come to you from every direction for your harlotries.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	34	"Thus you are different from those women in your harlotries, in that no one plays the harlot as you do, because you give money and no money is given you; thus you are different."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	35	Therefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	36	Thus says the Lord GOD, "Because your lewdness was poured out and your nakedness uncovered through your harlotries with your lovers and with all your detestable idols, and because of the blood of your sons which you gave to idols,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	37	therefore, behold, I will gather all your lovers with whom you took pleasure, even all those whom you loved and all those whom you hated. So I will gather them against you from every direction and expose your nakedness to them that they may see all your nakedness.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	38	"Thus I will judge you like women who commit adultery or shed blood are judged; and I will bring on you the blood of wrath and jealousy.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	39	"I will also give you into the hands of your lovers, and they will tear down your shrines, demolish your high places, strip you of your clothing, take away your jewels, and will leave you naked and bare.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	40	"They will incite a crowd against you and they will stone you and cut you to pieces with their swords.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	41	"They will burn your houses with fire and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women. Then I will stop you from playing the harlot, and you will also no longer pay your lovers.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	42	"So I will calm My fury against you and My jealousy will depart from you, and I will be pacified and angry no more.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	43	"Because you have not remembered the days of your youth but have enraged Me by all these things, behold, I in turn will bring your conduct down on your own head," declares the Lord GOD, "so that you will not commit this lewdness on top of all your other abominations.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	44	"Behold, everyone who quotes proverbs will quote this proverb concerning you, saying, 'Like mother, like daughter.'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	45	"You are the daughter of your mother, who loathed her husband and children. You are also the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	46	"Now your older sister is Samaria, who lives north of you with her daughters; and your younger sister, who lives south of you, is Sodom with her daughters.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	47	"Yet you have not merely walked in their ways or done according to their abominations; but, as if that were too little, you acted more corruptly in all your conduct than they.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	48	"As I live," declares the Lord GOD, "Sodom, your sister and her daughters have not done as you and your daughters have done.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	49	"Behold, this was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had arrogance, abundant food and careless ease, but she did not help the poor and needy.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	50	"Thus they were haughty and committed abominations before Me. Therefore I removed them when I saw it.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	51	"Furthermore, Samaria did not commit half of your sins, for you have multiplied your abominations more than they. Thus you have made your sisters appear righteous by all your abominations which you have committed.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	52	"Also bear your disgrace in that you have made judgment favorable for your sisters. Because of your sins in which you acted more abominably than they, they are more in the right than you. Yes, be also ashamed and bear your disgrace, in that you made your sisters appear righteous.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	53	"Nevertheless, I will restore their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, and along with them your own captivity,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	54	in order that you may bear your humiliation and feel ashamed for all that you have done when you become a consolation to them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	55	"Your sisters, Sodom with her daughters and Samaria with her daughters, will return to their former state, and you with your daughters will also return to your former state.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	56	"As the name of your sister Sodom was not heard from your lips in your day of pride,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	57	before your wickedness was uncovered, so now you have become the reproach of the daughters of Edom and of all who are around her, of the daughters of the Philistines--those surrounding you who despise you.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	58	"You have borne the penalty of your lewdness and abominations," the LORD declares.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	59	For thus says the Lord GOD, "I will also do with you as you have done, you who have despised the oath by breaking the covenant.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	60	"Nevertheless, I will remember My covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	61	"Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your sisters, both your older and your younger; and I will give them to you as daughters, but not because of your covenant.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	62	"Thus I will establish My covenant with you, and you shall know that I am the LORD,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	16	63	so that you may remember and be ashamed and never open your mouth anymore because of your humiliation, when I have forgiven you for all that you have done," the Lord GOD declares.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	17	1	Now the word of the LORD came to me saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	17	2	"Son of man, propound a riddle and speak a parable to the house of Israel,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	17	3	saying, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "A great eagle with great wings, long pinions and a full plumage of many colors came to Lebanon and took away the top of the cedar.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	17	4	"He plucked off the topmost of its young twigs and brought it to a land of merchants; he set it in a city of traders.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	17	5	"He also took some of the seed of the land and planted it in fertile soil. He placed it beside abundant waters; he set it like a willow.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	17	6	"Then it sprouted and became a low, spreading vine with its branches turned toward him, but its roots remained under it. So it became a vine and yielded shoots and sent out branches.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	17	7	"But there was another great eagle with great wings and much plumage; and behold, this vine bent its roots toward him and sent out its branches toward him from the beds where it was planted, that he might water it.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	17	8	"It was planted in good soil beside abundant waters, that it might yield branches and bear fruit and become a splendid vine."'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	17	9	"Say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Will it thrive? Will he not pull up its roots and cut off its fruit, so that it withers--so that all its sprouting leaves wither? And neither by great strength nor by many people can it be raised from its roots again.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	17	10	"Behold, though it is planted, will it thrive? Will it not completely wither as soon as the east wind strikes it--wither on the beds where it grew?"'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	17	11	Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	17	12	"Say now to the rebellious house, 'Do you not know what these things mean?' Say, 'Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, took its king and princes and brought them to him in Babylon.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	17	13	'He took one of the royal family and made a covenant with him, putting him under oath. He also took away the mighty of the land,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	17	14	that the kingdom might be in subjection, not exalting itself, but keeping his covenant that it might continue.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	17	15	'But he rebelled against him by sending his envoys to Egypt that they might give him horses and many troops. Will he succeed? Will he who does such things escape? Can he indeed break the covenant and escape?
Ezekiel	Eze	26	17	16	'As I live,' declares the Lord GOD, 'Surely in the country of the king who put him on the throne, whose oath he despised and whose covenant he broke, in Babylon he shall die.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	17	17	'Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company will not help him in the war, when they cast up ramps and build siege walls to cut off many lives.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	17	18	'Now he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, and behold, he pledged his allegiance, yet did all these things; he shall not escape.'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	17	19	Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, "As I live, surely My oath which he despised and My covenant which he broke, I will inflict on his head.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	17	20	"I will spread My net over him, and he will be caught in My snare. Then I will bring him to Babylon and enter into judgment with him there regarding the unfaithful act which he has committed against Me.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	17	21	"All the choice men in all his troops will fall by the sword, and the survivors will be scattered to every wind; and you will know that I, the LORD, have spoken."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	17	22	Thus says the Lord GOD, "I will also take a sprig from the lofty top of the cedar and set it out; I will pluck from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one and I will plant it on a high and lofty mountain.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	17	23	"On the high mountain of Israel I will plant it, that it may bring forth boughs and bear fruit and become a stately cedar. And birds of every kind will nest under it; they will nest in the shade of its branches.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	17	24	"All the trees of the field will know that I am the LORD; I bring down the high tree, exalt the low tree, dry up the green tree and make the dry tree flourish. I am the LORD; I have spoken, and I will perform it."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	18	1	Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	18	2	"What do you mean by using this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, 'The fathers eat the sour grapes, But the children's teeth are set on edge'?
Ezekiel	Eze	26	18	3	"As I live," declares the Lord GOD, "you are surely not going to use this proverb in Israel anymore.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	18	4	"Behold, all souls are Mine; the soul of the father as well as the soul of the son is Mine. The soul who sins will die.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	18	5	"But if a man is righteous and practices justice and righteousness,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	18	6	and does not eat at the mountain shrines or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, or defile his neighbor's wife or approach a woman during her menstrual period--
Ezekiel	Eze	26	18	7	if a man does not oppress anyone, but restores to the debtor his pledge, does not commit robbery, but gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with clothing,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	18	8	if he does not lend money on interest or take increase, if he keeps his hand from iniquity and executes true justice between man and man,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	18	9	if he walks in My statutes and My ordinances so as to deal faithfully--he is righteous and will surely live," declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	18	10	"Then he may have a violent son who sheds blood and who does any of these things to a brother
Ezekiel	Eze	26	18	11	(though he himself did not do any of these things), that is, he even eats at the mountain shrines, and defiles his neighbor's wife,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	18	12	oppresses the poor and needy, commits robbery, does not restore a pledge, but lifts up his eyes to the idols and commits abomination,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	18	13	he lends money on interest and takes increase; will he live? He will not live! He has committed all these abominations, he will surely be put to death; his blood will be on his own head.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	18	14	"Now behold, he has a son who has observed all his father's sins which he committed, and observing does not do likewise.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	18	15	"He does not eat at the mountain shrines or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, or defile his neighbor's wife,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	18	16	or oppress anyone, or retain a pledge, or commit robbery, but he gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with clothing,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	18	17	he keeps his hand from the poor, does not take interest or increase, but executes My ordinances, and walks in My statutes; he will not die for his father's iniquity, he will surely live.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	18	18	"As for his father, because he practiced extortion, robbed his brother and did what was not good among his people, behold, he will die for his iniquity.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	18	19	"Yet you say, 'Why should the son not bear the punishment for the father's iniquity?' When the son has practiced justice and righteousness and has observed all My statutes and done them, he shall surely live.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	18	20	"The person who sins will die. The son will not bear the punishment for the father's iniquity, nor will the father bear the punishment for the son's iniquity; the righteousness of the righteous will be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked will be upon himself.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	18	21	"But if the wicked man turns from all his sins which he has committed and observes all My statutes and practices justice and righteousness, he shall surely live; he shall not die.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	18	22	"All his transgressions which he has committed will not be remembered against him; because of his righteousness which he has practiced, he will live.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	18	23	"Do I have any pleasure in the death of the wicked," declares the Lord GOD, "rather than that he should turn from his ways and live?
Ezekiel	Eze	26	18	24	"But when a righteous man turns away from his righteousness, commits iniquity and does according to all the abominations that a wicked man does, will he live? All his righteous deeds which he has done will not be remembered for his treachery which he has committed and his sin which he has committed; for them he will die.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	18	25	"Yet you say, 'The way of the Lord is not right.' Hear now, O house of Israel! Is My way not right? Is it not your ways that are not right?
Ezekiel	Eze	26	18	26	"When a righteous man turns away from his righteousness, commits iniquity and dies because of it, for his iniquity which he has committed he will die.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	18	27	"Again, when a wicked man turns away from his wickedness which he has committed and practices justice and righteousness, he will save his life.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	18	28	"Because he considered and turned away from all his transgressions which he had committed, he shall surely live; he shall not die.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	18	29	"But the house of Israel says, 'The way of the Lord is not right.' Are My ways not right, O house of Israel? Is it not your ways that are not right?
Ezekiel	Eze	26	18	30	"Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, each according to his conduct," declares the Lord GOD. "Repent and turn away from all your transgressions, so that iniquity may not become a stumbling block to you.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	18	31	"Cast away from you all your transgressions which you have committed and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit! For why will you die, O house of Israel?
Ezekiel	Eze	26	18	32	"For I have no pleasure in the death of anyone who dies," declares the Lord GOD. "Therefore, repent and live."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	19	1	"As for you, take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel
Ezekiel	Eze	26	19	2	and say, 'What was your mother? A lioness among lions! She lay down among young lions, She reared her cubs.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	19	3	'When she brought up one of her cubs, He became a lion, And he learned to tear his prey; He devoured men.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	19	4	'Then nations heard about him; He was captured in their pit, And they brought him with hooks To the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	19	5	'When she saw, as she waited, That her hope was lost, She took another of her cubs And made him a young lion.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	19	6	'And he walked about among the lions; He became a young lion, He learned to tear his prey; He devoured men.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	19	7	'He destroyed their fortified towers And laid waste their cities; And the land and its fullness were appalled Because of the sound of his roaring.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	19	8	'Then nations set against him On every side from their provinces, And they spread their net over him; He was captured in their pit.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	19	9	'They put him in a cage with hooks And brought him to the king of Babylon; They brought him in hunting nets So that his voice would be heard no more On the mountains of Israel.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	19	10	'Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard, Planted by the waters; It was fruitful and full of branches Because of abundant waters.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	19	11	'And it had strong branches fit for scepters of rulers, And its height was raised above the clouds So that it was seen in its height with the mass of its branches.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	19	12	'But it was plucked up in fury; It was cast down to the ground; And the east wind dried up its fruit. Its strong branch was torn off So that it withered; The fire consumed it.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	19	13	'And now it is planted in the wilderness, In a dry and thirsty land.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	19	14	'And fire has gone out from its branch; It has consumed its shoots and fruit, So that there is not in it a strong branch, A scepter to rule.'" This is a lamentation, and has become a lamentation.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	1	Now in the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth of the month, certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the LORD, and sat before me.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	2	And the word of the LORD came to me saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	3	"Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel and say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Do you come to inquire of Me? As I live," declares the Lord GOD, "I will not be inquired of by you."'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	4	"Will you judge them, will you judge them, son of man? Make them know the abominations of their fathers;
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	5	and say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "On the day when I chose Israel and swore to the descendants of the house of Jacob and made Myself known to them in the land of Egypt, when I swore to them, saying, I am the LORD your God,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	6	on that day I swore to them, to bring them out from the land of Egypt into a land that I had selected for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	7	"I said to them, 'Cast away, each of you, the detestable things of his eyes, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am the LORD your God.'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	8	"But they rebelled against Me and were not willing to listen to Me; they did not cast away the detestable things of their eyes, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I resolved to pour out My wrath on them, to accomplish My anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	9	"But I acted for the sake of My name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations among whom they lived, in whose sight I made Myself known to them by bringing them out of the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	10	"So I took them out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	11	"I gave them My statutes and informed them of My ordinances, by which, if a man observes them, he will live.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	12	"Also I gave them My sabbaths to be a sign between Me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD who sanctifies them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	13	"But the house of Israel rebelled against Me in the wilderness. They did not walk in My statutes and they rejected My ordinances, by which, if a man observes them, he will live; and My sabbaths they greatly profaned. Then I resolved to pour out My wrath on them in the wilderness, to annihilate them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	14	"But I acted for the sake of My name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, before whose sight I had brought them out.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	15	"Also I swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	16	because they rejected My ordinances, and as for My statutes, they did not walk in them; they even profaned My sabbaths, for their heart continually went after their idols.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	17	"Yet My eye spared them rather than destroying them, and I did not cause their annihilation in the wilderness.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	18	"I said to their children in the wilderness, 'Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers or keep their ordinances or defile yourselves with their idols.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	19	'I am the LORD your God; walk in My statutes and keep My ordinances and observe them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	20	'Sanctify My sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between Me and you, that you may know that I am the LORD your God.'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	21	"But the children rebelled against Me; they did not walk in My statutes, nor were they careful to observe My ordinances, by which, if a man observes them, he will live; they profaned My sabbaths. So I resolved to pour out My wrath on them, to accomplish My anger against them in the wilderness.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	22	"But I withdrew My hand and acted for the sake of My name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	23	"Also I swore to them in the wilderness that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them among the lands,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	24	because they had not observed My ordinances, but had rejected My statutes and had profaned My sabbaths, and their eyes were on the idols of their fathers.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	25	"I also gave them statutes that were not good and ordinances by which they could not live;
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	26	and I pronounced them unclean because of their gifts, in that they caused all their firstborn to pass through the fire so that I might make them desolate, in order that they might know that I am the LORD."'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	27	"Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel and say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed Me by acting treacherously against Me.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	28	"When I had brought them into the land which I swore to give to them, then they saw every high hill and every leafy tree, and they offered there their sacrifices and there they presented the provocation of their offering. There also they made their soothing aroma and there they poured out their drink offerings.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	29	"Then I said to them, 'What is the high place to which you go?' So its name is called Bamah to this day."'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	30	"Therefore, say to the house of Israel, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Will you defile yourselves after the manner of your fathers and play the harlot after their detestable things?
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	31	"When you offer your gifts, when you cause your sons to pass through the fire, you are defiling yourselves with all your idols to this day. And shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live," declares the Lord GOD, "I will not be inquired of by you.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	32	"What comes into your mind will not come about, when you say: 'We will be like the nations, like the tribes of the lands, serving wood and stone.'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	33	"As I live," declares the Lord GOD, "surely with a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm and with wrath poured out, I shall be king over you.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	34	"I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you from the lands where you are scattered, with a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm and with wrath poured out;
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	35	and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will enter into judgment with you face to face.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	36	"As I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will enter into judgment with you," declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	37	"I will make you pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant;
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	38	and I will purge from you the rebels and those who transgress against Me; I will bring them out of the land where they sojourn, but they will not enter the land of Israel. Thus you will know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	39	"As for you, O house of Israel," thus says the Lord GOD, "Go, serve everyone his idols; but later you will surely listen to Me, and My holy name you will profane no longer with your gifts and with your idols.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	40	"For on My holy mountain, on the high mountain of Israel," declares the Lord GOD, "there the whole house of Israel, all of them, will serve Me in the land; there I will accept them and there I will seek your contributions and the choicest of your gifts, with all your holy things.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	41	"As a soothing aroma I will accept you when I bring you out from the peoples and gather you from the lands where you are scattered; and I will prove Myself holy among you in the sight of the nations.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	42	"And you will know that I am the LORD, when I bring you into the land of Israel, into the land which I swore to give to your forefathers.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	43	"There you will remember your ways and all your deeds with which you have defiled yourselves; and you will loathe yourselves in your own sight for all the evil things that you have done.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	44	"Then you will know that I am the LORD when I have dealt with you for My name's sake, not according to your evil ways or according to your corrupt deeds, O house of Israel," declares the Lord GOD.'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	45	Now the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	46	"Son of man, set your face toward Teman, and speak out against the south and prophesy against the forest land of the Negev,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	47	and say to the forest of the Negev, 'Hear the word of the LORD: thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I am about to kindle a fire in you, and it will consume every green tree in you, as well as every dry tree; the blazing flame will not be quenched and the whole surface from south to north will be burned by it.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	48	"All flesh will see that I, the LORD, have kindled it; it shall not be quenched."'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	20	49	Then I said, "Ah Lord GOD! They are saying of me, 'Is he not just speaking parables?'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	21	1	And the word of the LORD came to me saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	21	2	"Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem, and speak against the sanctuaries and prophesy against the land of Israel;
Ezekiel	Eze	26	21	3	and say to the land of Israel, 'Thus says the LORD, "Behold, I am against you; and I will draw My sword out of its sheath and cut off from you the righteous and the wicked.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	21	4	"Because I will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked, therefore My sword will go forth from its sheath against all flesh from south to north.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	21	5	"Thus all flesh will know that I, the LORD, have drawn My sword out of its sheath. It will not return to its sheath again."'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	21	6	"As for you, son of man, groan with breaking heart and bitter grief, groan in their sight.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	21	7	"And when they say to you, 'Why do you groan?' you shall say, 'Because of the news that is coming; and every heart will melt, all hands will be feeble, every spirit will faint and all knees will be weak as water. Behold, it comes and it will happen,' declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	21	8	Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	21	9	"Son of man, prophesy and say, 'Thus says the LORD.' Say, 'A sword, a sword sharpened And also polished!
Ezekiel	Eze	26	21	10	'Sharpened to make a slaughter, Polished to flash like lightning!' Or shall we rejoice, the rod of My son despising every tree?
Ezekiel	Eze	26	21	11	"It is given to be polished, that it may be handled; the sword is sharpened and polished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	21	12	"Cry out and wail, son of man; for it is against My people, it is against all the officials of Israel. They are delivered over to the sword with My people, therefore strike your thigh.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	21	13	"For there is a testing; and what if even the rod which despises will be no more?" declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	21	14	"You therefore, son of man, prophesy and clap your hands together; and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword for the slain. It is the sword for the great one slain, which surrounds them,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	21	15	that their hearts may melt, and many fall at all their gates. I have given the glittering sword. Ah! It is made for striking like lightning, it is wrapped up in readiness for slaughter.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	21	16	"Show yourself sharp, go to the right; set yourself; go to the left, wherever your edge is appointed.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	21	17	"I will also clap My hands together, and I will appease My wrath; I, the LORD, have spoken."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	21	18	The word of the LORD came to me saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	21	19	"As for you, son of man, make two ways for the sword of the king of Babylon to come; both of them will go out of one land. And make a signpost; make it at the head of the way to the city.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	21	20	"You shall mark a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and to Judah into fortified Jerusalem.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	21	21	"For the king of Babylon stands at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination; he shakes the arrows, he consults the household idols, he looks at the liver.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	21	22	"Into his right hand came the divination, 'Jerusalem,' to set battering rams, to open the mouth for slaughter, to lift up the voice with a battle cry, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up ramps, to build a siege wall.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	21	23	"And it will be to them like a false divination in their eyes; they have sworn solemn oaths. But he brings iniquity to remembrance, that they may be seized.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	21	24	"Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, 'Because you have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your deeds your sins appear--because you have come to remembrance, you will be seized with the hand.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	21	25	'And you, O slain, wicked one, the prince of Israel, whose day has come, in the time of the punishment of the end,'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	21	26	thus says the Lord GOD, 'Remove the turban and take off the crown; this will no longer be the same. Exalt that which is low and abase that which is high.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	21	27	'A ruin, a ruin, a ruin, I will make it. This also will be no more until He comes whose right it is, and I will give it to Him.'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	21	28	"And you, son of man, prophesy and say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD concerning the sons of Ammon and concerning their reproach,' and say: 'A sword, a sword is drawn, polished for the slaughter, to cause it to consume, that it may be like lightning--
Ezekiel	Eze	26	21	29	while they see for you false visions, while they divine lies for you--to place you on the necks of the wicked who are slain, whose day has come, in the time of the punishment of the end.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	21	30	'Return it to its sheath. In the place where you were created, in the land of your origin, I will judge you.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	21	31	'I will pour out My indignation on you; I will blow on you with the fire of My wrath, and I will give you into the hand of brutal men, skilled in destruction.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	21	32	'You will be fuel for the fire; your blood will be in the midst of the land. You will not be remembered, for I, the LORD, have spoken.'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	22	1	Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	22	2	"And you, son of man, will you judge, will you judge the bloody city? Then cause her to know all her abominations.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	22	3	"You shall say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "A city shedding blood in her midst, so that her time will come, and that makes idols, contrary to her interest, for defilement!
Ezekiel	Eze	26	22	4	"You have become guilty by the blood which you have shed, and defiled by your idols which you have made. Thus you have brought your day near and have come to your years; therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations and a mocking to all the lands.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	22	5	"Those who are near and those who are far from you will mock you, you of ill repute, full of turmoil.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	22	6	"Behold, the rulers of Israel, each according to his power, have been in you for the purpose of shedding blood.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	22	7	"They have treated father and mother lightly within you. The alien they have oppressed in your midst; the fatherless and the widow they have wronged in you.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	22	8	"You have despised My holy things and profaned My sabbaths.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	22	9	"Slanderous men have been in you for the purpose of shedding blood, and in you they have eaten at the mountain shrines. In your midst they have committed acts of lewdness.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	22	10	"In you they have uncovered their fathers' nakedness; in you they have humbled her who was unclean in her menstrual impurity.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	22	11	"One has committed abomination with his neighbor's wife and another has lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law. And another in you has humbled his sister, his father's daughter.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	22	12	"In you they have taken bribes to shed blood; you have taken interest and profits, and you have injured your neighbors for gain by oppression, and you have forgotten Me," declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	22	13	"Behold, then, I smite My hand at your dishonest gain which you have acquired and at the bloodshed which is among you.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	22	14	"Can your heart endure, or can your hands be strong in the days that I will deal with you? I, the LORD, have spoken and will act.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	22	15	"I will scatter you among the nations and I will disperse you through the lands, and I will consume your uncleanness from you.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	22	16	"You will profane yourself in the sight of the nations, and you will know that I am the LORD."'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	22	17	And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	22	18	"Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to Me; all of them are bronze and tin and iron and lead in the furnace; they are the dross of silver.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	22	19	"Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, 'Because all of you have become dross, therefore, behold, I am going to gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	22	20	'As they gather silver and bronze and iron and lead and tin into the furnace to blow fire on it in order to melt it, so I will gather you in My anger and in My wrath and I will lay you there and melt you.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	22	21	'I will gather you and blow on you with the fire of My wrath, and you will be melted in the midst of it.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	22	22	'As silver is melted in the furnace, so you will be melted in the midst of it; and you will know that I, the LORD, have poured out My wrath on you.'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	22	23	And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	22	24	"Son of man, say to her, 'You are a land that is not cleansed or rained on in the day of indignation.'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	22	25	"There is a conspiracy of her prophets in her midst like a roaring lion tearing the prey. They have devoured lives; they have taken treasure and precious things; they have made many widows in the midst of her.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	22	26	"Her priests have done violence to My law and have profaned My holy things; they have made no distinction between the holy and the profane, and they have not taught the difference between the unclean and the clean; and they hide their eyes from My sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	22	27	"Her princes within her are like wolves tearing the prey, by shedding blood and destroying lives in order to get dishonest gain.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	22	28	"Her prophets have smeared whitewash for them, seeing false visions and divining lies for them, saying, 'Thus says the Lord GOD,' when the LORD has not spoken.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	22	29	"The people of the land have practiced oppression and committed robbery, and they have wronged the poor and needy and have oppressed the sojourner without justice.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	22	30	"I searched for a man among them who would build up the wall and stand in the gap before Me for the land, so that I would not destroy it; but I found no one.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	22	31	"Thus I have poured out My indignation on them; I have consumed them with the fire of My wrath; their way I have brought upon their heads," declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	1	The word of the LORD came to me again, saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	2	"Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother;
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	3	and they played the harlot in Egypt. They played the harlot in their youth; there their breasts were pressed and there their virgin bosom was handled.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	4	"Their names were Oholah the elder and Oholibah her sister. And they became Mine, and they bore sons and daughters. And as for their names, Samaria is Oholah and Jerusalem is Oholibah.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	5	"Oholah played the harlot while she was Mine; and she lusted after her lovers, after the Assyrians, her neighbors,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	6	who were clothed in purple, governors and officials, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	7	"She bestowed her harlotries on them, all of whom were the choicest men of Assyria; and with all whom she lusted after, with all their idols she defiled herself.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	8	"She did not forsake her harlotries from the time in Egypt; for in her youth men had lain with her, and they handled her virgin bosom and poured out their lust on her.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	9	"Therefore, I gave her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, after whom she lusted.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	10	"They uncovered her nakedness; they took her sons and her daughters, but they slew her with the sword. Thus she became a byword among women, and they executed judgments on her.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	11	"Now her sister Oholibah saw this, yet she was more corrupt in her lust than she, and her harlotries were more than the harlotries of her sister.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	12	"She lusted after the Assyrians, governors and officials, the ones near, magnificently dressed, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable young men.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	13	"I saw that she had defiled herself; they both took the same way.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	14	"So she increased her harlotries. And she saw men portrayed on the wall, images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	15	girded with belts on their loins, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them looking like officers, like the Babylonians in Chaldea, the land of their birth.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	16	"When she saw them she lusted after them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	17	"The Babylonians came to her to the bed of love and defiled her with their harlotry. And when she had been defiled by them, she became disgusted with them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	18	"She uncovered her harlotries and uncovered her nakedness; then I became disgusted with her, as I had become disgusted with her sister.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	19	"Yet she multiplied her harlotries, remembering the days of her youth, when she played the harlot in the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	20	"She lusted after their paramours, whose flesh is like the flesh of donkeys and whose issue is like the issue of horses.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	21	"Thus you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when the Egyptians handled your bosom because of the breasts of your youth.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	22	"Therefore, O Oholibah, thus says the Lord GOD, 'Behold I will arouse your lovers against you, from whom you were alienated, and I will bring them against you from every side:
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	23	the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them; desirable young men, governors and officials all of them, officers and men of renown, all of them riding on horses.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	24	'They will come against you with weapons, chariots and wagons, and with a company of peoples. They will set themselves against you on every side with buckler and shield and helmet; and I will commit the judgment to them, and they will judge you according to their customs.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	25	'I will set My jealousy against you, that they may deal with you in wrath. They will remove your nose and your ears; and your survivors will fall by the sword. They will take your sons and your daughters; and your survivors will be consumed by the fire.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	26	'They will also strip you of your clothes and take away your beautiful jewels.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	27	'Thus I will make your lewdness and your harlotry brought from the land of Egypt to cease from you, so that you will not lift up your eyes to them or remember Egypt anymore.'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	28	"For thus says the Lord GOD, 'Behold, I will give you into the hand of those whom you hate, into the hand of those from whom you were alienated.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	29	'They will deal with you in hatred, take all your property, and leave you naked and bare. And the nakedness of your harlotries will be uncovered, both your lewdness and your harlotries.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	30	'These things will be done to you because you have played the harlot with the nations, because you have defiled yourself with their idols.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	31	'You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore I will give her cup into your hand.'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	32	"Thus says the Lord GOD, 'You will drink your sister's cup, Which is deep and wide. You will be laughed at and held in derision; It contains much.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	33	'You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, The cup of horror and desolation, The cup of your sister Samaria.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	34	'You will drink it and drain it. Then you will gnaw its fragments And tear your breasts; for I have spoken,' declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	35	"Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, 'Because you have forgotten Me and cast Me behind your back, bear now the punishment of your lewdness and your harlotries.'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	36	Moreover, the LORD said to me, "Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare to them their abominations.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	37	"For they have committed adultery, and blood is on their hands. Thus they have committed adultery with their idols and even caused their sons, whom they bore to Me, to pass through the fire to them as food.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	38	"Again, they have done this to Me: they have defiled My sanctuary on the same day and have profaned My sabbaths.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	39	"For when they had slaughtered their children for their idols, they entered My sanctuary on the same day to profane it; and lo, thus they did within My house.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	40	"Furthermore, they have even sent for men who come from afar, to whom a messenger was sent; and lo, they came--for whom you bathed, painted your eyes and decorated yourselves with ornaments;
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	41	and you sat on a splendid couch with a table arranged before it on which you had set My incense and My oil.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	42	"The sound of a carefree multitude was with her; and drunkards were brought from the wilderness with men of the common sort. And they put bracelets on the hands of the women and beautiful crowns on their heads.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	43	"Then I said concerning her who was worn out by adulteries, 'Will they now commit adultery with her when she is thus?'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	44	"But they went in to her as they would go in to a harlot. Thus they went in to Oholah and to Oholibah, the lewd women.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	45	"But they, righteous men, will judge them with the judgment of adulteresses and with the judgment of women who shed blood, because they are adulteresses and blood is on their hands.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	46	"For thus says the Lord GOD, 'Bring up a company against them and give them over to terror and plunder.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	47	'The company will stone them with stones and cut them down with their swords; they will slay their sons and their daughters and burn their houses with fire.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	48	'Thus I will make lewdness cease from the land, that all women may be admonished and not commit lewdness as you have done.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	23	49	'Your lewdness will be requited upon you, and you will bear the penalty of worshiping your idols; thus you will know that I am the Lord GOD.'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	24	1	And the word of the LORD came to me in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth of the month, saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	24	2	"Son of man, write the name of the day, this very day. The king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	24	3	"Speak a parable to the rebellious house and say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Put on the pot, put it on and also pour water in it;
Ezekiel	Eze	26	24	4	Put in it the pieces, Every good piece, the thigh and the shoulder; Fill it with choice bones.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	24	5	"Take the choicest of the flock, And also pile wood under the pot. Make it boil vigorously. Also seethe its bones in it."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	24	6	'Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, "Woe to the bloody city, To the pot in which there is rust And whose rust has not gone out of it! Take out of it piece after piece, Without making a choice.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	24	7	"For her blood is in her midst; She placed it on the bare rock; She did not pour it on the ground To cover it with dust.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	24	8	"That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance, I have put her blood on the bare rock, That it may not be covered."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	24	9	'Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, "Woe to the bloody city! I also will make the pile great.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	24	10	"Heap on the wood, kindle the fire, Boil the flesh well And mix in the spices, And let the bones be burned.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	24	11	"Then set it empty on its coals So that it may be hot And its bronze may glow And its filthiness may be melted in it, Its rust consumed.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	24	12	"She has wearied Me with toil, Yet her great rust has not gone from her; Let her rust be in the fire!
Ezekiel	Eze	26	24	13	"In your filthiness is lewdness. Because I would have cleansed you, Yet you are not clean, You will not be cleansed from your filthiness again Until I have spent My wrath on you.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	24	14	"I, the LORD, have spoken; it is coming and I will act. I will not relent, and I will not pity and I will not be sorry; according to your ways and according to your deeds I will judge you," declares the Lord GOD.'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	24	15	And the word of the LORD came to me saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	24	16	"Son of man, behold, I am about to take from you the desire of your eyes with a blow; but you shall not mourn and you shall not weep, and your tears shall not come.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	24	17	"Groan silently; make no mourning for the dead. Bind on your turban and put your shoes on your feet, and do not cover your mustache and do not eat the bread of men."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	24	18	So I spoke to the people in the morning, and in the evening my wife died. And in the morning I did as I was commanded.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	24	19	The people said to me, "Will you not tell us what these things that you are doing mean for us?"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	24	20	Then I said to them, "The word of the LORD came to me saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	24	21	'Speak to the house of Israel, "Thus says the Lord GOD, 'Behold, I am about to profane My sanctuary, the pride of your power, the desire of your eyes and the delight of your soul; and your sons and your daughters whom you have left behind will fall by the sword.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	24	22	'You will do as I have done; you will not cover your mustache and you will not eat the bread of men.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	24	23	'Your turbans will be on your heads and your shoes on your feet. You will not mourn and you will not weep, but you will rot away in your iniquities and you will groan to one another.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	24	24	'Thus Ezekiel will be a sign to you; according to all that he has done you will do; when it comes, then you will know that I am the Lord GOD.'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	24	25	'As for you, son of man, will it not be on the day when I take from them their stronghold, the joy of their pride, the desire of their eyes and their heart's delight, their sons and their daughters,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	24	26	that on that day he who escapes will come to you with information for your ears?
Ezekiel	Eze	26	24	27	'On that day your mouth will be opened to him who escaped, and you will speak and be mute no longer. Thus you will be a sign to them, and they will know that I am the LORD.'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	25	1	And the word of the LORD came to me saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	25	2	"Son of man, set your face toward the sons of Ammon and prophesy against them,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	25	3	and say to the sons of Ammon, 'Hear the word of the Lord GOD! Thus says the Lord GOD, "Because you said, 'Aha!' against My sanctuary when it was profaned, and against the land of Israel when it was made desolate, and against the house of Judah when they went into exile,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	25	4	therefore, behold, I am going to give you to the sons of the east for a possession, and they will set their encampments among you and make their dwellings among you; they will eat your fruit and drink your milk.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	25	5	"I will make Rabbah a pasture for camels and the sons of Ammon a resting place for flocks. Thus you will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	25	6	'For thus says the Lord GOD, "Because you have clapped your hands and stamped your feet and rejoiced with all the scorn of your soul against the land of Israel,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	25	7	therefore, behold, I have stretched out My hand against you and I will give you for spoil to the nations. And I will cut you off from the peoples and make you perish from the lands; I will destroy you. Thus you will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	25	8	'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Because Moab and Seir say, 'Behold, the house of Judah is like all the nations,'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	25	9	therefore, behold, I am going to deprive the flank of Moab of its cities, of its cities which are on its frontiers, the glory of the land, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon and Kiriathaim,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	25	10	and I will give it for a possession along with the sons of Ammon to the sons of the east, so that the sons of Ammon will not be remembered among the nations.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	25	11	"Thus I will execute judgments on Moab, and they will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	25	12	'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Because Edom has acted against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and has incurred grievous guilt, and avenged themselves upon them,"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	25	13	therefore thus says the Lord GOD, "I will also stretch out My hand against Edom and cut off man and beast from it. And I will lay it waste; from Teman even to Dedan they will fall by the sword.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	25	14	"I will lay My vengeance on Edom by the hand of My people Israel. Therefore, they will act in Edom according to My anger and according to My wrath; thus they will know My vengeance," declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	25	15	'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Because the Philistines have acted in revenge and have taken vengeance with scorn of soul to destroy with everlasting enmity,"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	25	16	therefore thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I will stretch out My hand against the Philistines, even cut off the Cherethites and destroy the remnant of the seacoast.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	25	17	"I will execute great vengeance on them with wrathful rebukes; and they will know that I am the LORD when I lay My vengeance on them."'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	26	1	Now in the eleventh year, on the first of the month, the word of the LORD came to me saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	26	2	"Son of man, because Tyre has said concerning Jerusalem, 'Aha, the gateway of the peoples is broken; it has opened to me. I shall be filled, now that she is laid waste,'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	26	3	therefore thus says the Lord GOD, 'Behold, I am against you, O Tyre, and I will bring up many nations against you, as the sea brings up its waves.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	26	4	'They will destroy the walls of Tyre and break down her towers; and I will scrape her debris from her and make her a bare rock.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	26	5	'She will be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea, for I have spoken,' declares the Lord GOD, 'and she will become spoil for the nations.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	26	6	'Also her daughters who are on the mainland will be slain by the sword, and they will know that I am the LORD.'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	26	7	For thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I will bring upon Tyre from the north Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, with horses, chariots, cavalry and a great army.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	26	8	"He will slay your daughters on the mainland with the sword; and he will make siege walls against you, cast up a ramp against you and raise up a large shield against you.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	26	9	"The blow of his battering rams he will direct against your walls, and with his axes he will break down your towers.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	26	10	"Because of the multitude of his horses, the dust raised by them will cover you; your walls will shake at the noise of cavalry and wagons and chariots when he enters your gates as men enter a city that is breached.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	26	11	"With the hoofs of his horses he will trample all your streets. He will slay your people with the sword; and your strong pillars will come down to the ground.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	26	12	"Also they will make a spoil of your riches and a prey of your merchandise, break down your walls and destroy your pleasant houses, and throw your stones and your timbers and your debris into the water.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	26	13	"So I will silence the sound of your songs, and the sound of your harps will be heard no more.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	26	14	"I will make you a bare rock; you will be a place for the spreading of nets. You will be built no more, for I the LORD have spoken," declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	26	15	Thus says the Lord GOD to Tyre, "Shall not the coastlands shake at the sound of your fall when the wounded groan, when the slaughter occurs in your midst?
Ezekiel	Eze	26	26	16	"Then all the princes of the sea will go down from their thrones, remove their robes and strip off their embroidered garments. They will clothe themselves with trembling; they will sit on the ground, tremble every moment and be appalled at you.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	26	17	"They will take up a lamentation over you and say to you, 'How you have perished, O inhabited one, From the seas, O renowned city, Which was mighty on the sea, She and her inhabitants, Who imposed her terror On all her inhabitants!
Ezekiel	Eze	26	26	18	'Now the coastlands will tremble On the day of your fall; Yes, the coastlands which are by the sea Will be terrified at your passing.'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	26	19	For thus says the Lord GOD, "When I make you a desolate city, like the cities which are not inhabited, when I bring up the deep over you and the great waters cover you,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	26	20	then I will bring you down with those who go down to the pit, to the people of old, and I will make you dwell in the lower parts of the earth, like the ancient waste places, with those who go down to the pit, so that you will not be inhabited; but I will set glory in the land of the living.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	26	21	"I will bring terrors on you and you will be no more; though you will be sought, you will never be found again," declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	27	1	Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	27	2	"And you, son of man, take up a lamentation over Tyre;
Ezekiel	Eze	26	27	3	and say to Tyre, who dwells at the entrance to the sea, merchant of the peoples to many coastlands, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "O Tyre, you have said, 'I am perfect in beauty.'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	27	4	"Your borders are in the heart of the seas; Your builders have perfected your beauty.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	27	5	"They have made all your planks of fir trees from Senir; They have taken a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	27	6	"Of oaks from Bashan they have made your oars; With ivory they have inlaid your deck of boxwood from the coastlands of Cyprus.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	27	7	"Your sail was of fine embroidered linen from Egypt So that it became your distinguishing mark; Your awning was blue and purple from the coastlands of Elishah.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	27	8	"The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were your rowers; Your wise men, O Tyre, were aboard; they were your pilots.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	27	9	"The elders of Gebal and her wise men were with you repairing your seams; All the ships of the sea and their sailors were with you in order to deal in your merchandise.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	27	10	"Persia and Lud and Put were in your army, your men of war. They hung shield and helmet in you; they set forth your splendor.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	27	11	"The sons of Arvad and your army were on your walls, all around, and the Gammadim were in your towers. They hung their shields on your walls all around; they perfected your beauty.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	27	12	"Tarshish was your customer because of the abundance of all kinds of wealth; with silver, iron, tin and lead they paid for your wares.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	27	13	"Javan, Tubal and Meshech, they were your traders; with the lives of men and vessels of bronze they paid for your merchandise.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	27	14	"Those from Beth-togarmah gave horses and war horses and mules for your wares.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	27	15	"The sons of Dedan were your traders. Many coastlands were your market; ivory tusks and ebony they brought as your payment.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	27	16	"Aram was your customer because of the abundance of your goods; they paid for your wares with emeralds, purple, embroidered work, fine linen, coral and rubies.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	27	17	"Judah and the land of Israel, they were your traders; with the wheat of Minnith, cakes, honey, oil and balm they paid for your merchandise.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	27	18	"Damascus was your customer because of the abundance of your goods, because of the abundance of all kinds of wealth, because of the wine of Helbon and white wool.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	27	19	"Vedan and Javan paid for your wares from Uzal; wrought iron, cassia and sweet cane were among your merchandise.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	27	20	"Dedan traded with you in saddlecloths for riding.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	27	21	"Arabia and all the princes of Kedar, they were your customers for lambs, rams and goats; for these they were your customers.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	27	22	"The traders of Sheba and Raamah, they traded with you; they paid for your wares with the best of all kinds of spices, and with all kinds of precious stones and gold.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	27	23	"Haran, Canneh, Eden, the traders of Sheba, Asshur and Chilmad traded with you.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	27	24	"They traded with you in choice garments, in clothes of blue and embroidered work, and in carpets of many colors and tightly wound cords, which were among your merchandise.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	27	25	"The ships of Tarshish were the carriers for your merchandise. And you were filled and were very glorious In the heart of the seas.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	27	26	"Your rowers have brought you Into great waters; The east wind has broken you In the heart of the seas.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	27	27	"Your wealth, your wares, your merchandise, Your sailors and your pilots, Your repairers of seams, your dealers in merchandise And all your men of war who are in you, With all your company that is in your midst, Will fall into the heart of the seas On the day of your overthrow.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	27	28	"At the sound of the cry of your pilots The pasture lands will shake.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	27	29	"All who handle the oar, The sailors and all the pilots of the sea Will come down from their ships; They will stand on the land,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	27	30	And they will make their voice heard over you And will cry bitterly. They will cast dust on their heads, They will wallow in ashes.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	27	31	"Also they will make themselves bald for you And gird themselves with sackcloth; And they will weep for you in bitterness of soul With bitter mourning.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	27	32	"Moreover, in their wailing they will take up a lamentation for you And lament over you: 'Who is like Tyre, Like her who is silent in the midst of the sea?
Ezekiel	Eze	26	27	33	'When your wares went out from the seas, You satisfied many peoples; With the abundance of your wealth and your merchandise You enriched the kings of earth.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	27	34	'Now that you are broken by the seas In the depths of the waters, Your merchandise and all your company Have fallen in the midst of you.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	27	35	'All the inhabitants of the coastlands Are appalled at you, And their kings are horribly afraid; They are troubled in countenance.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	27	36	'The merchants among the peoples hiss at you; You have become terrified And you will cease to be forever.'"'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	28	1	The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	28	2	"Son of man, say to the leader of Tyre, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Because your heart is lifted up And you have said, 'I am a god, I sit in the seat of gods In the heart of the seas'; Yet you are a man and not God, Although you make your heart like the heart of God--
Ezekiel	Eze	26	28	3	Behold, you are wiser than Daniel; There is no secret that is a match for you.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	28	4	"By your wisdom and understanding You have acquired riches for yourself And have acquired gold and silver for your treasuries.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	28	5	"By your great wisdom, by your trade You have increased your riches And your heart is lifted up because of your riches--
Ezekiel	Eze	26	28	6	Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, 'Because you have made your heart Like the heart of God,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	28	7	Therefore, behold, I will bring strangers upon you, The most ruthless of the nations. And they will draw their swords Against the beauty of your wisdom And defile your splendor.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	28	8	'They will bring you down to the pit, And you will die the death of those who are slain In the heart of the seas.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	28	9	'Will you still say, "I am a god," In the presence of your slayer, Though you are a man and not God, In the hands of those who wound you?
Ezekiel	Eze	26	28	10	'You will die the death of the uncircumcised By the hand of strangers, For I have spoken!' declares the Lord GOD!"'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	28	11	Again the word of the LORD came to me saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	28	12	"Son of man, take up a lamentation over the king of Tyre and say to him, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "You had the seal of perfection, Full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	28	13	"You were in Eden, the garden of God; Every precious stone was your covering: The ruby, the topaz and the diamond; The beryl, the onyx and the jasper; The lapis lazuli, the turquoise and the emerald; And the gold, the workmanship of your settings and sockets, Was in you. On the day that you were created They were prepared.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	28	14	"You were the anointed cherub who covers, And I placed you there. You were on the holy mountain of God; You walked in the midst of the stones of fire.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	28	15	"You were blameless in your ways From the day you were created Until unrighteousness was found in you.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	28	16	"By the abundance of your trade You were internally filled with violence, And you sinned; Therefore I have cast you as profane From the mountain of God. And I have destroyed you, O covering cherub, From the midst of the stones of fire.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	28	17	"Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty; You corrupted your wisdom by reason of your splendor. I cast you to the ground; I put you before kings, That they may see you.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	28	18	"By the multitude of your iniquities, In the unrighteousness of your trade You profaned your sanctuaries. Therefore I have brought fire from the midst of you; It has consumed you, And I have turned you to ashes on the earth In the eyes of all who see you.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	28	19	"All who know you among the peoples Are appalled at you; You have become terrified And you will cease to be forever."'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	28	20	And the word of the LORD came to me saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	28	21	"Son of man, set your face toward Sidon, prophesy against her
Ezekiel	Eze	26	28	22	and say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I am against you, O Sidon, And I will be glorified in your midst. Then they will know that I am the LORD when I execute judgments in her, And I will manifest My holiness in her.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	28	23	"For I will send pestilence to her And blood to her streets, And the wounded will fall in her midst By the sword upon her on every side; Then they will know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	28	24	"And there will be no more for the house of Israel a prickling brier or a painful thorn from any round about them who scorned them; then they will know that I am the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	28	25	'Thus says the Lord GOD, "When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered, and will manifest My holiness in them in the sight of the nations, then they will live in their land which I gave to My servant Jacob.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	28	26	"They will live in it securely; and they will build houses, plant vineyards and live securely when I execute judgments upon all who scorn them round about them. Then they will know that I am the LORD their God."'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	29	1	In the tenth year, in the tenth month, on the twelfth of the month, the word of the LORD came to me saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	29	2	"Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt and prophesy against him and against all Egypt.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	29	3	"Speak and say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, The great monster that lies in the midst of his rivers, That has said, 'My Nile is mine, and I myself have made it.'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	29	4	"I will put hooks in your jaws And make the fish of your rivers cling to your scales. And I will bring you up out of the midst of your rivers, And all the fish of your rivers will cling to your scales.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	29	5	"I will abandon you to the wilderness, you and all the fish of your rivers; You will fall on the open field; you will not be brought together or gathered. I have given you for food to the beasts of the earth and to the birds of the sky.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	29	6	"Then all the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am the LORD, Because they have been only a staff made of reed to the house of Israel.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	29	7	"When they took hold of you with the hand, You broke and tore all their hands; And when they leaned on you, You broke and made all their loins quake."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	29	8	'Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I will bring upon you a sword and I will cut off from you man and beast.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	29	9	"The land of Egypt will become a desolation and waste. Then they will know that I am the LORD. Because you said, 'The Nile is mine, and I have made it,'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	29	10	therefore, behold, I am against you and against your rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation, from Migdol to Syene and even to the border of Ethiopia.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	29	11	"A man's foot will not pass through it, and the foot of a beast will not pass through it, and it will not be inhabited for forty years.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	29	12	"So I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of desolated lands. And her cities, in the midst of cities that are laid waste, will be desolate forty years; and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the lands."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	29	13	'For thus says the Lord GOD, "At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the peoples among whom they were scattered.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	29	14	"I will turn the fortunes of Egypt and make them return to the land of Pathros, to the land of their origin, and there they will be a lowly kingdom.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	29	15	"It will be the lowest of the kingdoms, and it will never again lift itself up above the nations. And I will make them so small that they will not rule over the nations.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	29	16	"And it will never again be the confidence of the house of Israel, bringing to mind the iniquity of their having turned to Egypt. Then they will know that I am the Lord GOD."'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	29	17	Now in the twenty-seventh year, in the first month, on the first of the month, the word of the LORD came to me saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	29	18	"Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made his army labor hard against Tyre; every head was made bald and every shoulder was rubbed bare. But he and his army had no wages from Tyre for the labor that he had performed against it."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	29	19	Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. And he will carry off her wealth and capture her spoil and seize her plunder; and it will be wages for his army.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	29	20	"I have given him the land of Egypt for his labor which he performed, because they acted for Me," declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	29	21	"On that day I will make a horn sprout for the house of Israel, and I will open your mouth in their midst. Then they will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	30	1	The word of the LORD came again to me saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	30	2	"Son of man, prophesy and say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Wail, 'Alas for the day!'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	30	3	"For the day is near, Even the day of the LORD is near; It will be a day of clouds, A time of doom for the nations.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	30	4	"A sword will come upon Egypt, And anguish will be in Ethiopia; When the slain fall in Egypt, They take away her wealth, And her foundations are torn down.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	30	5	"Ethiopia, Put, Lud, all Arabia, Libya and the people of the land that is in league will fall with them by the sword."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	30	6	'Thus says the LORD, "Indeed, those who support Egypt will fall And the pride of her power will come down; From Migdol to Syene They will fall within her by the sword," Declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	30	7	"They will be desolate In the midst of the desolated lands; And her cities will be In the midst of the devastated cities.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	30	8	"And they will know that I am the LORD, When I set a fire in Egypt And all her helpers are broken.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	30	9	"On that day messengers will go forth from Me in ships to frighten secure Ethiopia; and anguish will be on them as on the day of Egypt; for behold, it comes!"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	30	10	'Thus says the Lord GOD, "I will also make the hordes of Egypt cease By the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	30	11	"He and his people with him, The most ruthless of the nations, Will be brought in to destroy the land; And they will draw their swords against Egypt And fill the land with the slain.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	30	12	"Moreover, I will make the Nile canals dry And sell the land into the hands of evil men. And I will make the land desolate And all that is in it, By the hand of strangers; I the LORD have spoken."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	30	13	'Thus says the Lord GOD, "I will also destroy the idols And make the images cease from Memphis. And there will no longer be a prince in the land of Egypt; And I will put fear in the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	30	14	"I will make Pathros desolate, Set a fire in Zoan And execute judgments on Thebes.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	30	15	"I will pour out My wrath on Sin, The stronghold of Egypt; I will also cut off the hordes of Thebes.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	30	16	"I will set a fire in Egypt; Sin will writhe in anguish, Thebes will be breached And Memphis will have distresses daily.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	30	17	"The young men of On and of Pi-beseth Will fall by the sword, And the women will go into captivity.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	30	18	"In Tehaphnehes the day will be dark When I break there the yoke bars of Egypt. Then the pride of her power will cease in her; A cloud will cover her, And her daughters will go into captivity.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	30	19	"Thus I will execute judgments on Egypt, And they will know that I am the LORD."'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	30	20	In the eleventh year, in the first month, on the seventh of the month, the word of the LORD came to me saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	30	21	"Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, behold, it has not been bound up for healing or wrapped with a bandage, that it may be strong to hold the sword.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	30	22	"Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, 'Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt and will break his arms, both the strong and the broken; and I will make the sword fall from his hand.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	30	23	'I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the lands.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	30	24	'For I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon and put My sword in his hand; and I will break the arms of Pharaoh, so that he will groan before him with the groanings of a wounded man.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	30	25	'Thus I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, but the arms of Pharaoh will fall. Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I put My sword into the hand of the king of Babylon and he stretches it out against the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	30	26	'When I scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the lands, then they will know that I am the LORD.'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	31	1	In the eleventh year, in the third month, on the first of the month, the word of the LORD came to me saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	31	2	"Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his hordes, 'Whom are you like in your greatness?
Ezekiel	Eze	26	31	3	'Behold, Assyria was a cedar in Lebanon With beautiful branches and forest shade, And very high, And its top was among the clouds.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	31	4	'The waters made it grow, the deep made it high. With its rivers it continually extended all around its planting place, And sent out its channels to all the trees of the field.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	31	5	'Therefore its height was loftier than all the trees of the field And its boughs became many and its branches long Because of many waters as it spread them out.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	31	6	'All the birds of the heavens nested in its boughs, And under its branches all the beasts of the field gave birth, And all great nations lived under its shade.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	31	7	'So it was beautiful in its greatness, in the length of its branches; For its roots extended to many waters.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	31	8	'The cedars in God's garden could not match it; The cypresses could not compare with its boughs, And the plane trees could not match its branches. No tree in God's garden could compare with it in its beauty.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	31	9	'I made it beautiful with the multitude of its branches, And all the trees of Eden, which were in the garden of God, were jealous of it.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	31	10	'Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, "Because it is high in stature and has set its top among the clouds, and its heart is haughty in its loftiness,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	31	11	therefore I will give it into the hand of a despot of the nations; he will thoroughly deal with it. According to its wickedness I have driven it away.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	31	12	"Alien tyrants of the nations have cut it down and left it; on the mountains and in all the valleys its branches have fallen and its boughs have been broken in all the ravines of the land. And all the peoples of the earth have gone down from its shade and left it.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	31	13	"On its ruin all the birds of the heavens will dwell, and all the beasts of the field will be on its fallen branches
Ezekiel	Eze	26	31	14	so that all the trees by the waters may not be exalted in their stature, nor set their top among the clouds, nor their well-watered mighty ones stand erect in their height. For they have all been given over to death, to the earth beneath, among the sons of men, with those who go down to the pit."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	31	15	'Thus says the Lord GOD, "On the day when it went down to Sheol I caused lamentations; I closed the deep over it and held back its rivers. And its many waters were stopped up, and I made Lebanon mourn for it, and all the trees of the field wilted away on account of it.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	31	16	"I made the nations quake at the sound of its fall when I made it go down to Sheol with those who go down to the pit; and all the well-watered trees of Eden, the choicest and best of Lebanon, were comforted in the earth beneath.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	31	17	"They also went down with it to Sheol to those who were slain by the sword; and those who were its strength lived under its shade among the nations.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	31	18	"To which among the trees of Eden are you thus equal in glory and greatness? Yet you will be brought down with the trees of Eden to the earth beneath; you will lie in the midst of the uncircumcised, with those who were slain by the sword. So is Pharaoh and all his hordes!"' declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	32	1	In the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first of the month, the word of the LORD came to me saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	32	2	"Son of man, take up a lamentation over Pharaoh king of Egypt and say to him, 'You compared yourself to a young lion of the nations, Yet you are like the monster in the seas; And you burst forth in your rivers And muddied the waters with your feet And fouled their rivers.'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	32	3	Thus says the Lord GOD, "Now I will spread My net over you With a company of many peoples, And they shall lift you up in My net.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	32	4	"I will leave you on the land; I will cast you on the open field. And I will cause all the birds of the heavens to dwell on you, And I will satisfy the beasts of the whole earth with you.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	32	5	"I will lay your flesh on the mountains And fill the valleys with your refuse.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	32	6	"I will also make the land drink the discharge of your blood As far as the mountains, And the ravines will be full of you.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	32	7	"And when I extinguish you, I will cover the heavens and darken their stars; I will cover the sun with a cloud And the moon will not give its light.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	32	8	"All the shining lights in the heavens I will darken over you And will set darkness on your land," Declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	32	9	"I will also trouble the hearts of many peoples when I bring your destruction among the nations, into lands which you have not known.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	32	10	"I will make many peoples appalled at you, and their kings will be horribly afraid of you when I brandish My sword before them; and they will tremble every moment, every man for his own life, on the day of your fall."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	32	11	For thus says the Lord GOD, "The sword of the king of Babylon will come upon you.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	32	12	"By the swords of the mighty ones I will cause your hordes to fall; all of them are tyrants of the nations, And they will devastate the pride of Egypt, And all its hordes will be destroyed.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	32	13	"I will also destroy all its cattle from beside many waters; And the foot of man will not muddy them anymore And the hoofs of beasts will not muddy them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	32	14	"Then I will make their waters settle And will cause their rivers to run like oil," Declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	32	15	"When I make the land of Egypt a desolation, And the land is destitute of that which filled it, When I smite all those who live in it, Then they shall know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	32	16	"This is a lamentation and they shall chant it. The daughters of the nations shall chant it. Over Egypt and over all her hordes they shall chant it," declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	32	17	In the twelfth year, on the fifteenth of the month, the word of the LORD came to me saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	32	18	"Son of man, wail for the hordes of Egypt and bring it down, her and the daughters of the powerful nations, to the nether world, with those who go down to the pit;
Ezekiel	Eze	26	32	19	'Whom do you surpass in beauty? Go down and make your bed with the uncircumcised.'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	32	20	"They shall fall in the midst of those who are slain by the sword. She is given over to the sword; they have drawn her and all her hordes away.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	32	21	"The strong among the mighty ones shall speak of him and his helpers from the midst of Sheol, 'They have gone down, they lie still, the uncircumcised, slain by the sword.'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	32	22	"Assyria is there and all her company; her graves are round about her. All of them are slain, fallen by the sword,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	32	23	whose graves are set in the remotest parts of the pit and her company is round about her grave. All of them are slain, fallen by the sword, who spread terror in the land of the living.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	32	24	"Elam is there and all her hordes around her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who went down uncircumcised to the lower parts of the earth, who instilled their terror in the land of the living and bore their disgrace with those who went down to the pit.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	32	25	"They have made a bed for her among the slain with all her hordes. Her graves are around it, they are all uncircumcised, slain by the sword (although their terror was instilled in the land of the living), and they bore their disgrace with those who go down to the pit; they were put in the midst of the slain.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	32	26	"Meshech, Tubal and all their hordes are there; their graves surround them. All of them were slain by the sword uncircumcised, though they instilled their terror in the land of the living.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	32	27	"Nor do they lie beside the fallen heroes of the uncircumcised, who went down to Sheol with their weapons of war and whose swords were laid under their heads; but the punishment for their iniquity rested on their bones, though the terror of these heroes was once in the land of the living.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	32	28	"But in the midst of the uncircumcised you will be broken and lie with those slain by the sword.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	32	29	"There also is Edom, its kings and all its princes, who for all their might are laid with those slain by the sword; they will lie with the uncircumcised and with those who go down to the pit.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	32	30	"There also are the chiefs of the north, all of them, and all the Sidonians, who in spite of the terror resulting from their might, in shame went down with the slain. So they lay down uncircumcised with those slain by the sword and bore their disgrace with those who go down to the pit.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	32	31	"These Pharaoh will see, and he will be comforted for all his hordes slain by the sword, even Pharaoh and all his army," declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	32	32	"Though I instilled a terror of him in the land of the living, yet he will be made to lie down among the uncircumcised along with those slain by the sword, even Pharaoh and all his hordes," declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	33	1	And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	33	2	"Son of man, speak to the sons of your people and say to them, 'If I bring a sword upon a land, and the people of the land take one man from among them and make him their watchman,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	33	3	and he sees the sword coming upon the land and blows on the trumpet and warns the people,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	33	4	then he who hears the sound of the trumpet and does not take warning, and a sword comes and takes him away, his blood will be on his own head.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	33	5	'He heard the sound of the trumpet but did not take warning; his blood will be on himself. But had he taken warning, he would have delivered his life.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	33	6	'But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet and the people are not warned, and a sword comes and takes a person from them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood I will require from the watchman's hand.'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	33	7	"Now as for you, son of man, I have appointed you a watchman for the house of Israel; so you will hear a message from My mouth and give them warning from Me.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	33	8	"When I say to the wicked, 'O wicked man, you will surely die,' and you do not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require from your hand.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	33	9	"But if you on your part warn a wicked man to turn from his way and he does not turn from his way, he will die in his iniquity, but you have delivered your life.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	33	10	"Now as for you, son of man, say to the house of Israel, 'Thus you have spoken, saying, "Surely our transgressions and our sins are upon us, and we are rotting away in them; how then can we survive?"'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	33	11	"Say to them, 'As I live!' declares the Lord GOD, 'I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn back, turn back from your evil ways! Why then will you die, O house of Israel?'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	33	12	"And you, son of man, say to your fellow citizens, 'The righteousness of a righteous man will not deliver him in the day of his transgression, and as for the wickedness of the wicked, he will not stumble because of it in the day when he turns from his wickedness; whereas a righteous man will not be able to live by his righteousness on the day when he commits sin.'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	33	13	"When I say to the righteous he will surely live, and he so trusts in his righteousness that he commits iniquity, none of his righteous deeds will be remembered; but in that same iniquity of his which he has committed he will die.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	33	14	"But when I say to the wicked, 'You will surely die,' and he turns from his sin and practices justice and righteousness,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	33	15	if a wicked man restores a pledge, pays back what he has taken by robbery, walks by the statutes which ensure life without committing iniquity, he shall surely live; he shall not die.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	33	16	"None of his sins that he has committed will be remembered against him. He has practiced justice and righteousness; he shall surely live.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	33	17	"Yet your fellow citizens say, 'The way of the Lord is not right,' when it is their own way that is not right.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	33	18	"When the righteous turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, then he shall die in it.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	33	19	"But when the wicked turns from his wickedness and practices justice and righteousness, he will live by them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	33	20	"Yet you say, 'The way of the Lord is not right.' O house of Israel, I will judge each of you according to his ways."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	33	21	Now in the twelfth year of our exile, on the fifth of the tenth month, the refugees from Jerusalem came to me, saying, "The city has been taken."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	33	22	Now the hand of the LORD had been upon me in the evening, before the refugees came. And He opened my mouth at the time they came to me in the morning; so my mouth was opened and I was no longer speechless.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	33	23	Then the word of the LORD came to me saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	33	24	"Son of man, they who live in these waste places in the land of Israel are saying, 'Abraham was only one, yet he possessed the land; so to us who are many the land has been given as a possession.'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	33	25	"Therefore say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "You eat meat with the blood in it, lift up your eyes to your idols as you shed blood. Should you then possess the land?
Ezekiel	Eze	26	33	26	"You rely on your sword, you commit abominations and each of you defiles his neighbor's wife. Should you then possess the land?"'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	33	27	"Thus you shall say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "As I live, surely those who are in the waste places will fall by the sword, and whoever is in the open field I will give to the beasts to be devoured, and those who are in the strongholds and in the caves will die of pestilence.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	33	28	"I will make the land a desolation and a waste, and the pride of her power will cease; and the mountains of Israel will be desolate so that no one will pass through.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	33	29	"Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I make the land a desolation and a waste because of all their abominations which they have committed."'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	33	30	"But as for you, son of man, your fellow citizens who talk about you by the walls and in the doorways of the houses, speak to one another, each to his brother, saying, 'Come now and hear what the message is which comes forth from the LORD.'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	33	31	"They come to you as people come, and sit before you as My people and hear your words, but they do not do them, for they do the lustful desires expressed by their mouth, and their heart goes after their gain.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	33	32	"Behold, you are to them like a sensual song by one who has a beautiful voice and plays well on an instrument; for they hear your words but they do not practice them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	33	33	"So when it comes to pass--as surely it will--then they will know that a prophet has been in their midst."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	34	1	Then the word of the LORD came to me saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	34	2	"Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel. Prophesy and say to those shepherds, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Woe, shepherds of Israel who have been feeding themselves! Should not the shepherds feed the flock?
Ezekiel	Eze	26	34	3	"You eat the fat and clothe yourselves with the wool, you slaughter the fat sheep without feeding the flock.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	34	4	"Those who are sickly you have not strengthened, the diseased you have not healed, the broken you have not bound up, the scattered you have not brought back, nor have you sought for the lost; but with force and with severity you have dominated them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	34	5	"They were scattered for lack of a shepherd, and they became food for every beast of the field and were scattered.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	34	6	"My flock wandered through all the mountains and on every high hill; My flock was scattered over all the surface of the earth, and there was no one to search or seek for them."'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	34	7	Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD:
Ezekiel	Eze	26	34	8	"As I live," declares the Lord GOD, "surely because My flock has become a prey, My flock has even become food for all the beasts of the field for lack of a shepherd, and My shepherds did not search for My flock, but rather the shepherds fed themselves and did not feed My flock;
Ezekiel	Eze	26	34	9	therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD:
Ezekiel	Eze	26	34	10	'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I am against the shepherds, and I will demand My sheep from them and make them cease from feeding sheep. So the shepherds will not feed themselves anymore, but I will deliver My flock from their mouth, so that they will not be food for them."'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	34	11	For thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I Myself will search for My sheep and seek them out.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	34	12	"As a shepherd cares for his herd in the day when he is among his scattered sheep, so I will care for My sheep and will deliver them from all the places to which they were scattered on a cloudy and gloomy day.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	34	13	"I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries and bring them to their own land; and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the streams, and in all the inhabited places of the land.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	34	14	"I will feed them in a good pasture, and their grazing ground will be on the mountain heights of Israel. There they will lie down on good grazing ground and feed in rich pasture on the mountains of Israel.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	34	15	"I will feed My flock and I will lead them to rest," declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	34	16	"I will seek the lost, bring back the scattered, bind up the broken and strengthen the sick; but the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will feed them with judgment.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	34	17	"As for you, My flock, thus says the Lord GOD, 'Behold, I will judge between one sheep and another, between the rams and the male goats.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	34	18	'Is it too slight a thing for you that you should feed in the good pasture, that you must tread down with your feet the rest of your pastures? Or that you should drink of the clear waters, that you must foul the rest with your feet?
Ezekiel	Eze	26	34	19	'As for My flock, they must eat what you tread down with your feet and drink what you foul with your feet!'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	34	20	Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD to them, "Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	34	21	"Because you push with side and with shoulder, and thrust at all the weak with your horns until you have scattered them abroad,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	34	22	therefore, I will deliver My flock, and they will no longer be a prey; and I will judge between one sheep and another.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	34	23	"Then I will set over them one shepherd, My servant David, and he will feed them; he will feed them himself and be their shepherd.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	34	24	"And I, the LORD, will be their God, and My servant David will be prince among them; I the LORD have spoken.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	34	25	"I will make a covenant of peace with them and eliminate harmful beasts from the land so that they may live securely in the wilderness and sleep in the woods.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	34	26	"I will make them and the places around My hill a blessing. And I will cause showers to come down in their season; they will be showers of blessing.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	34	27	"Also the tree of the field will yield its fruit and the earth will yield its increase, and they will be secure on their land. Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I have broken the bars of their yoke and have delivered them from the hand of those who enslaved them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	34	28	"They will no longer be a prey to the nations, and the beasts of the earth will not devour them; but they will live securely, and no one will make them afraid.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	34	29	"I will establish for them a renowned planting place, and they will not again be victims of famine in the land, and they will not endure the insults of the nations anymore.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	34	30	"Then they will know that I, the LORD their God, am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are My people," declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	34	31	"As for you, My sheep, the sheep of My pasture, you are men, and I am your God," declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	35	1	Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	35	2	"Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir, and prophesy against it
Ezekiel	Eze	26	35	3	and say to it, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I am against you, Mount Seir, And I will stretch out My hand against you And make you a desolation and a waste.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	35	4	"I will lay waste your cities And you will become a desolation. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	35	5	"Because you have had everlasting enmity and have delivered the sons of Israel to the power of the sword at the time of their calamity, at the time of the punishment of the end,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	35	6	therefore as I live," declares the Lord GOD, "I will give you over to bloodshed, and bloodshed will pursue you; since you have not hated bloodshed, therefore bloodshed will pursue you.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	35	7	"I will make Mount Seir a waste and a desolation and I will cut off from it the one who passes through and returns.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	35	8	"I will fill its mountains with its slain; on your hills and in your valleys and in all your ravines those slain by the sword will fall.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	35	9	"I will make you an everlasting desolation and your cities will not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	35	10	"Because you have said, 'These two nations and these two lands will be mine, and we will possess them,' although the LORD was there,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	35	11	therefore as I live," declares the Lord GOD, "I will deal with you according to your anger and according to your envy which you showed because of your hatred against them; so I will make Myself known among them when I judge you.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	35	12	"Then you will know that I, the LORD, have heard all your revilings which you have spoken against the mountains of Israel saying, 'They are laid desolate; they are given to us for food.'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	35	13	"And you have spoken arrogantly against Me and have multiplied your words against Me; I have heard it."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	35	14	'Thus says the Lord GOD, "As all the earth rejoices, I will make you a desolation.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	35	15	"As you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel because it was desolate, so I will do to you. You will be a desolation, O Mount Seir, and all Edom, all of it. Then they will know that I am the LORD."'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	1	"And you, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel and say, 'O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	2	'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Because the enemy has spoken against you, 'Aha!' and, 'The everlasting heights have become our possession,'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	3	therefore prophesy and say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "For good reason they have made you desolate and crushed you from every side, that you would become a possession of the rest of the nations and you have been taken up in the talk and the whispering of the people."'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	4	'Therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD. Thus says the Lord GOD to the mountains and to the hills, to the ravines and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes and to the forsaken cities which have become a prey and a derision to the rest of the nations which are round about,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	5	therefore thus says the Lord GOD, "Surely in the fire of My jealousy I have spoken against the rest of the nations, and against all Edom, who appropriated My land for themselves as a possession with wholehearted joy and with scorn of soul, to drive it out for a prey."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	6	'Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel and say to the mountains and to the hills, to the ravines and to the valleys, "Thus says the Lord GOD, 'Behold, I have spoken in My jealousy and in My wrath because you have endured the insults of the nations.'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	7	"Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, 'I have sworn that surely the nations which are around you will themselves endure their insults.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	8	'But you, O mountains of Israel, you will put forth your branches and bear your fruit for My people Israel; for they will soon come.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	9	'For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn to you, and you will be cultivated and sown.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	10	'I will multiply men on you, all the house of Israel, all of it; and the cities will be inhabited and the waste places will be rebuilt.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	11	'I will multiply on you man and beast; and they will increase and be fruitful; and I will cause you to be inhabited as you were formerly and will treat you better than at the first. Thus you will know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	12	'Yes, I will cause men--My people Israel--to walk on you and possess you, so that you will become their inheritance and never again bereave them of children.'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	13	"Thus says the Lord GOD, 'Because they say to you, "You are a devourer of men and have bereaved your nation of children,"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	14	therefore you will no longer devour men and no longer bereave your nation of children,' declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	15	"I will not let you hear insults from the nations anymore, nor will you bear disgrace from the peoples any longer, nor will you cause your nation to stumble any longer," declares the Lord GOD.'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	16	Then the word of the LORD came to me saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	17	"Son of man, when the house of Israel was living in their own land, they defiled it by their ways and their deeds; their way before Me was like the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	18	"Therefore I poured out My wrath on them for the blood which they had shed on the land, because they had defiled it with their idols.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	19	"Also I scattered them among the nations and they were dispersed throughout the lands. According to their ways and their deeds I judged them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	20	"When they came to the nations where they went, they profaned My holy name, because it was said of them, 'These are the people of the LORD; yet they have come out of His land.'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	21	"But I had concern for My holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations where they went.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	22	"Therefore say to the house of Israel, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "It is not for your sake, O house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for My holy name, which you have profaned among the nations where you went.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	23	"I will vindicate the holiness of My great name which has been profaned among the nations, which you have profaned in their midst. Then the nations will know that I am the LORD," declares the Lord GOD, "when I prove Myself holy among you in their sight.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	24	"For I will take you from the nations, gather you from all the lands and bring you into your own land.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	25	"Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean; I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	26	"Moreover, I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	27	"I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will be careful to observe My ordinances.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	28	"You will live in the land that I gave to your forefathers; so you will be My people, and I will be your God.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	29	"Moreover, I will save you from all your uncleanness; and I will call for the grain and multiply it, and I will not bring a famine on you.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	30	"I will multiply the fruit of the tree and the produce of the field, so that you will not receive again the disgrace of famine among the nations.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	31	"Then you will remember your evil ways and your deeds that were not good, and you will loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and your abominations.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	32	"I am not doing this for your sake," declares the Lord GOD, "let it be known to you. Be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel!"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	33	'Thus says the Lord GOD, "On the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places will be rebuilt.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	34	"The desolate land will be cultivated instead of being a desolation in the sight of everyone who passes by.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	35	"They will say, 'This desolate land has become like the garden of Eden; and the waste, desolate and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited.'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	36	"Then the nations that are left round about you will know that I, the LORD, have rebuilt the ruined places and planted that which was desolate; I, the LORD, have spoken and will do it."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	37	'Thus says the Lord GOD, "This also I will let the house of Israel ask Me to do for them: I will increase their men like a flock.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	36	38	"Like the flock for sacrifices, like the flock at Jerusalem during her appointed feasts, so will the waste cities be filled with flocks of men. Then they will know that I am the LORD."'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	37	1	The hand of the LORD was upon me, and He brought me out by the Spirit of the LORD and set me down in the middle of the valley; and it was full of bones.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	37	2	He caused me to pass among them round about, and behold, there were very many on the surface of the valley; and lo, they were very dry.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	37	3	He said to me, "Son of man, can these bones live?" And I answered, "O Lord GOD, You know."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	37	4	Again He said to me, "Prophesy over these bones and say to them, 'O dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	37	5	"Thus says the Lord GOD to these bones, 'Behold, I will cause breath to enter you that you may come to life.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	37	6	'I will put sinews on you, make flesh grow back on you, cover you with skin and put breath in you that you may come alive; and you will know that I am the LORD.'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	37	7	So I prophesied as I was commanded; and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold, a rattling; and the bones came together, bone to its bone.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	37	8	And I looked, and behold, sinews were on them, and flesh grew and skin covered them; but there was no breath in them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	37	9	Then He said to me, "Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, son of man, and say to the breath, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain, that they come to life."'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	37	10	So I prophesied as He commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they came to life and stood on their feet, an exceedingly great army.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	37	11	Then He said to me, "Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel; behold, they say, 'Our bones are dried up and our hope has perished. We are completely cut off.'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	37	12	"Therefore prophesy and say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves, My people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	37	13	"Then you will know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your graves and caused you to come up out of your graves, My people.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	37	14	"I will put My Spirit within you and you will come to life, and I will place you on your own land. Then you will know that I, the LORD, have spoken and done it," declares the LORD.'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	37	15	The word of the LORD came again to me saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	37	16	"And you, son of man, take for yourself one stick and write on it, 'For Judah and for the sons of Israel, his companions'; then take another stick and write on it, 'For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim and all the house of Israel, his companions.'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	37	17	"Then join them for yourself one to another into one stick, that they may become one in your hand.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	37	18	"When the sons of your people speak to you saying, 'Will you not declare to us what you mean by these?'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	37	19	say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel, his companions; and I will put them with it, with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they will be one in My hand."'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	37	20	"The sticks on which you write will be in your hand before their eyes.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	37	21	"Say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I will take the sons of Israel from among the nations where they have gone, and I will gather them from every side and bring them into their own land;
Ezekiel	Eze	26	37	22	and I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel; and one king will be king for all of them; and they will no longer be two nations and no longer be divided into two kingdoms.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	37	23	"They will no longer defile themselves with their idols, or with their detestable things, or with any of their transgressions; but I will deliver them from all their dwelling places in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them. And they will be My people, and I will be their God.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	37	24	"My servant David will be king over them, and they will all have one shepherd; and they will walk in My ordinances and keep My statutes and observe them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	37	25	"They will live on the land that I gave to Jacob My servant, in which your fathers lived; and they will live on it, they, and their sons and their sons' sons, forever; and David My servant will be their prince forever.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	37	26	"I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be an everlasting covenant with them. And I will place them and multiply them, and will set My sanctuary in their midst forever.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	37	27	"My dwelling place also will be with them; and I will be their God, and they will be My people.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	37	28	"And the nations will know that I am the LORD who sanctifies Israel, when My sanctuary is in their midst forever."'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	38	1	And the word of the LORD came to me saying,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	38	2	"Son of man, set your face toward Gog of the land of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him
Ezekiel	Eze	26	38	3	and say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I am against you, O Gog, prince of Rosh, Meshech and Tubal.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	38	4	"I will turn you about and put hooks into your jaws, and I will bring you out, and all your army, horses and horsemen, all of them splendidly attired, a great company with buckler and shield, all of them wielding swords;
Ezekiel	Eze	26	38	5	Persia, Ethiopia and Put with them, all of them with shield and helmet;
Ezekiel	Eze	26	38	6	Gomer with all its troops; Beth-togarmah from the remote parts of the north with all its troops--many peoples with you.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	38	7	"Be prepared, and prepare yourself, you and all your companies that are assembled about you, and be a guard for them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	38	8	"After many days you will be summoned; in the latter years you will come into the land that is restored from the sword, whose inhabitants have been gathered from many nations to the mountains of Israel which had been a continual waste; but its people were brought out from the nations, and they are living securely, all of them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	38	9	"You will go up, you will come like a storm; you will be like a cloud covering the land, you and all your troops, and many peoples with you."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	38	10	'Thus says the Lord GOD, "It will come about on that day, that thoughts will come into your mind and you will devise an evil plan,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	38	11	and you will say, 'I will go up against the land of unwalled villages. I will go against those who are at rest, that live securely, all of them living without walls and having no bars or gates,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	38	12	to capture spoil and to seize plunder, to turn your hand against the waste places which are now inhabited, and against the people who are gathered from the nations, who have acquired cattle and goods, who live at the center of the world.'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	38	13	"Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish with all its villages will say to you, 'Have you come to capture spoil? Have you assembled your company to seize plunder, to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to capture great spoil?'"'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	38	14	"Therefore prophesy, son of man, and say to Gog, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "On that day when My people Israel are living securely, will you not know it?
Ezekiel	Eze	26	38	15	"You will come from your place out of the remote parts of the north, you and many peoples with you, all of them riding on horses, a great assembly and a mighty army;
Ezekiel	Eze	26	38	16	and you will come up against My people Israel like a cloud to cover the land. It shall come about in the last days that I will bring you against My land, so that the nations may know Me when I am sanctified through you before their eyes, O Gog."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	38	17	'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Are you the one of whom I spoke in former days through My servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in those days for many years that I would bring you against them?
Ezekiel	Eze	26	38	18	"It will come about on that day, when Gog comes against the land of Israel," declares the Lord GOD, "that My fury will mount up in My anger.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	38	19	"In My zeal and in My blazing wrath I declare that on that day there will surely be a great earthquake in the land of Israel.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	38	20	"The fish of the sea, the birds of the heavens, the beasts of the field, all the creeping things that creep on the earth, and all the men who are on the face of the earth will shake at My presence; the mountains also will be thrown down, the steep pathways will collapse and every wall will fall to the ground.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	38	21	"I will call for a sword against him on all My mountains," declares the Lord GOD. "Every man's sword will be against his brother.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	38	22	"With pestilence and with blood I will enter into judgment with him; and I will rain on him and on his troops, and on the many peoples who are with him, a torrential rain, with hailstones, fire and brimstone.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	38	23	"I will magnify Myself, sanctify Myself, and make Myself known in the sight of many nations; and they will know that I am the LORD."'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	39	1	"And you, son of man, prophesy against Gog and say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I am against you, O Gog, prince of Rosh, Meshech and Tubal;
Ezekiel	Eze	26	39	2	and I will turn you around, drive you on, take you up from the remotest parts of the north and bring you against the mountains of Israel.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	39	3	"I will strike your bow from your left hand and dash down your arrows from your right hand.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	39	4	"You will fall on the mountains of Israel, you and all your troops and the peoples who are with you; I will give you as food to every kind of predatory bird and beast of the field.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	39	5	"You will fall on the open field; for it is I who have spoken," declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	39	6	"And I will send fire upon Magog and those who inhabit the coastlands in safety; and they will know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	39	7	"My holy name I will make known in the midst of My people Israel; and I will not let My holy name be profaned anymore. And the nations will know that I am the LORD, the Holy One in Israel.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	39	8	"Behold, it is coming and it shall be done," declares the Lord GOD. "That is the day of which I have spoken.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	39	9	"Then those who inhabit the cities of Israel will go out and make fires with the weapons and burn them, both shields and bucklers, bows and arrows, war clubs and spears, and for seven years they will make fires of them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	39	10	"They will not take wood from the field or gather firewood from the forests, for they will make fires with the weapons; and they will take the spoil of those who despoiled them and seize the plunder of those who plundered them," declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	39	11	"On that day I will give Gog a burial ground there in Israel, the valley of those who pass by east of the sea, and it will block off those who would pass by. So they will bury Gog there with all his horde, and they will call it the valley of Hamon-gog.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	39	12	"For seven months the house of Israel will be burying them in order to cleanse the land.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	39	13	"Even all the people of the land will bury them; and it will be to their renown on the day that I glorify Myself," declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	39	14	"They will set apart men who will constantly pass through the land, burying those who were passing through, even those left on the surface of the ground, in order to cleanse it. At the end of seven months they will make a search.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	39	15	"As those who pass through the land pass through and anyone sees a man's bone, then he will set up a marker by it until the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamon-gog.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	39	16	"And even the name of the city will be Hamonah. So they will cleanse the land."'
Ezekiel	Eze	26	39	17	"As for you, son of man, thus says the Lord GOD, 'Speak to every kind of bird and to every beast of the field, "Assemble and come, gather from every side to My sacrifice which I am going to sacrifice for you, as a great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel, that you may eat flesh and drink blood.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	39	18	"You will eat the flesh of mighty men and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, as though they were rams, lambs, goats and bulls, all of them fatlings of Bashan.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	39	19	"So you will eat fat until you are glutted, and drink blood until you are drunk, from My sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	39	20	"You will be glutted at My table with horses and charioteers, with mighty men and all the men of war," declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	39	21	"And I will set My glory among the nations; and all the nations will see My judgment which I have executed and My hand which I have laid on them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	39	22	"And the house of Israel will know that I am the LORD their God from that day onward.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	39	23	"The nations will know that the house of Israel went into exile for their iniquity because they acted treacherously against Me, and I hid My face from them; so I gave them into the hand of their adversaries, and all of them fell by the sword.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	39	24	"According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions I dealt with them, and I hid My face from them."'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	39	25	Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, "Now I will restore the fortunes of Jacob and have mercy on the whole house of Israel; and I will be jealous for My holy name.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	39	26	"They will forget their disgrace and all their treachery which they perpetrated against Me, when they live securely on their own land with no one to make them afraid.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	39	27	"When I bring them back from the peoples and gather them from the lands of their enemies, then I shall be sanctified through them in the sight of the many nations.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	39	28	"Then they will know that I am the LORD their God because I made them go into exile among the nations, and then gathered them again to their own land; and I will leave none of them there any longer.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	39	29	"I will not hide My face from them any longer, for I will have poured out My Spirit on the house of Israel," declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	1	In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was taken, on that same day the hand of the LORD was upon me and He brought me there.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	2	In the visions of God He brought me into the land of Israel and set me on a very high mountain, and on it to the south there was a structure like a city.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	3	So He brought me there; and behold, there was a man whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze, with a line of flax and a measuring rod in his hand; and he was standing in the gateway.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	4	The man said to me, "Son of man, see with your eyes, hear with your ears, and give attention to all that I am going to show you; for you have been brought here in order to show it to you. Declare to the house of Israel all that you see."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	5	And behold, there was a wall on the outside of the temple all around, and in the man's hand was a measuring rod of six cubits, each of which was a cubit and a handbreadth. So he measured the thickness of the wall, one rod; and the height, one rod.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	6	Then he went to the gate which faced east, went up its steps and measured the threshold of the gate, one rod in width; and the other threshold was one rod in width.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	7	The guardroom was one rod long and one rod wide; and there were five cubits between the guardrooms. And the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate facing inward was one rod.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	8	Then he measured the porch of the gate facing inward, one rod.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	9	He measured the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and its side pillars, two cubits. And the porch of the gate was faced inward.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	10	The guardrooms of the gate toward the east numbered three on each side; the three of them had the same measurement. The side pillars also had the same measurement on each side.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	11	And he measured the width of the gateway, ten cubits, and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	12	There was a barrier wall one cubit wide in front of the guardrooms on each side; and the guardrooms were six cubits square on each side.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	13	He measured the gate from the roof of the one guardroom to the roof of the other, a width of twenty-five cubits from one door to the door opposite.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	14	He made the side pillars sixty cubits high; the gate extended round about to the side pillar of the courtyard.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	15	From the front of the entrance gate to the front of the inner porch of the gate was fifty cubits.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	16	There were shuttered windows looking toward the guardrooms, and toward their side pillars within the gate all around, and likewise for the porches. And there were windows all around inside; and on each side pillar were palm tree ornaments.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	17	Then he brought me into the outer court, and behold, there were chambers and a pavement made for the court all around; thirty chambers faced the pavement.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	18	The pavement (that is, the lower pavement) was by the side of the gates, corresponding to the length of the gates.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	19	Then he measured the width from the front of the lower gate to the front of the exterior of the inner court, a hundred cubits on the east and on the north.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	20	As for the gate of the outer court which faced the north, he measured its length and its width.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	21	It had three guardrooms on each side; and its side pillars and its porches had the same measurement as the first gate. Its length was fifty cubits and the width twenty-five cubits.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	22	Its windows and its porches and its palm tree ornaments had the same measurements as the gate which faced toward the east; and it was reached by seven steps, and its porch was in front of them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	23	The inner court had a gate opposite the gate on the north as well as the gate on the east; and he measured a hundred cubits from gate to gate.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	24	Then he led me toward the south, and behold, there was a gate toward the south; and he measured its side pillars and its porches according to those same measurements.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	25	The gate and its porches had windows all around like those other windows; the length was fifty cubits and the width twenty-five cubits.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	26	There were seven steps going up to it, and its porches were in front of them; and it had palm tree ornaments on its side pillars, one on each side.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	27	The inner court had a gate toward the south; and he measured from gate to gate toward the south, a hundred cubits.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	28	Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate; and he measured the south gate according to those same measurements.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	29	Its guardrooms also, its side pillars and its porches were according to those same measurements. And the gate and its porches had windows all around; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	30	There were porches all around, twenty-five cubits long and five cubits wide.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	31	Its porches were toward the outer court; and palm tree ornaments were on its side pillars, and its stairway had eight steps.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	32	He brought me into the inner court toward the east. And he measured the gate according to those same measurements.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	33	Its guardrooms also, its side pillars and its porches were according to those same measurements. And the gate and its porches had windows all around; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	34	Its porches were toward the outer court; and palm tree ornaments were on its side pillars, on each side, and its stairway had eight steps.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	35	Then he brought me to the north gate; and he measured it according to those same measurements,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	36	with its guardrooms, its side pillars and its porches. And the gate had windows all around; the length was fifty cubits and the width twenty-five cubits.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	37	Its side pillars were toward the outer court; and palm tree ornaments were on its side pillars on each side, and its stairway had eight steps.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	38	A chamber with its doorway was by the side pillars at the gates; there they rinse the burnt offering.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	39	In the porch of the gate were two tables on each side, on which to slaughter the burnt offering, the sin offering and the guilt offering.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	40	On the outer side, as one went up to the gateway toward the north, were two tables; and on the other side of the porch of the gate were two tables.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	41	Four tables were on each side next to the gate; or, eight tables on which they slaughter sacrifices.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	42	For the burnt offering there were four tables of hewn stone, a cubit and a half long, a cubit and a half wide and one cubit high, on which they lay the instruments with which they slaughter the burnt offering and the sacrifice.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	43	The double hooks, one handbreadth in length, were installed in the house all around; and on the tables was the flesh of the offering.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	44	From the outside to the inner gate were chambers for the singers in the inner court, one of which was at the side of the north gate, with its front toward the south, and one at the side of the south gate facing toward the north.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	45	He said to me, "This is the chamber which faces toward the south, intended for the priests who keep charge of the temple;
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	46	but the chamber which faces toward the north is for the priests who keep charge of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, who from the sons of Levi come near to the LORD to minister to Him."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	47	He measured the court, a perfect square, a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits wide; and the altar was in front of the temple.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	48	Then he brought me to the porch of the temple and measured each side pillar of the porch, five cubits on each side; and the width of the gate was three cubits on each side.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	40	49	The length of the porch was twenty cubits and the width eleven cubits; and at the stairway by which it was ascended were columns belonging to the side pillars, one on each side.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	41	1	Then he brought me to the nave and measured the side pillars; six cubits wide on each side was the width of the side pillar.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	41	2	The width of the entrance was ten cubits and the sides of the entrance were five cubits on each side. And he measured the length of the nave, forty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	41	3	Then he went inside and measured each side pillar of the doorway, two cubits, and the doorway, six cubits high; and the width of the doorway, seven cubits.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	41	4	He measured its length, twenty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits, before the nave; and he said to me, "This is the most holy place."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	41	5	Then he measured the wall of the temple, six cubits; and the width of the side chambers, four cubits, all around about the house on every side.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	41	6	The side chambers were in three stories, one above another, and thirty in each story; and the side chambers extended to the wall which stood on their inward side all around, that they might be fastened, and not be fastened into the wall of the temple itself.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	41	7	The side chambers surrounding the temple were wider at each successive story. Because the structure surrounding the temple went upward by stages on all sides of the temple, therefore the width of the temple increased as it went higher; and thus one went up from the lowest story to the highest by way of the second story.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	41	8	I saw also that the house had a raised platform all around; the foundations of the side chambers were a full rod of six long cubits in height.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	41	9	The thickness of the outer wall of the side chambers was five cubits. But the free space between the side chambers belonging to the temple
Ezekiel	Eze	26	41	10	and the outer chambers was twenty cubits in width all around the temple on every side.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	41	11	The doorways of the side chambers toward the free space consisted of one doorway toward the north and another doorway toward the south; and the width of the free space was five cubits all around.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	41	12	The building that was in front of the separate area at the side toward the west was seventy cubits wide; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length was ninety cubits.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	41	13	Then he measured the temple, a hundred cubits long; the separate area with the building and its walls were also a hundred cubits long.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	41	14	Also the width of the front of the temple and that of the separate areas along the east side totaled a hundred cubits.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	41	15	He measured the length of the building along the front of the separate area behind it, with a gallery on each side, a hundred cubits; he also measured the inner nave and the porches of the court.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	41	16	The thresholds, the latticed windows and the galleries round about their three stories, opposite the threshold, were paneled with wood all around, and from the ground to the windows (but the windows were covered),
Ezekiel	Eze	26	41	17	over the entrance, and to the inner house, and on the outside, and on all the wall all around inside and outside, by measurement.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	41	18	It was carved with cherubim and palm trees; and a palm tree was between cherub and cherub, and every cherub had two faces,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	41	19	a man's face toward the palm tree on one side and a young lion's face toward the palm tree on the other side; they were carved on all the house all around.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	41	20	From the ground to above the entrance cherubim and palm trees were carved, as well as on the wall of the nave.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	41	21	The doorposts of the nave were square; as for the front of the sanctuary, the appearance of one doorpost was like that of the other.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	41	22	The altar was of wood, three cubits high and its length two cubits; its corners, its base and its sides were of wood. And he said to me, "This is the table that is before the LORD."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	41	23	The nave and the sanctuary each had a double door.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	41	24	Each of the doors had two leaves, two swinging leaves; two leaves for one door and two leaves for the other.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	41	25	Also there were carved on them, on the doors of the nave, cherubim and palm trees like those carved on the walls; and there was a threshold of wood on the front of the porch outside.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	41	26	There were latticed windows and palm trees on one side and on the other, on the sides of the porch; thus were the side chambers of the house and the thresholds.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	42	1	Then he brought me out into the outer court, the way toward the north; and he brought me to the chamber which was opposite the separate area and opposite the building toward the north.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	42	2	Along the length, which was a hundred cubits, was the north door; the width was fifty cubits.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	42	3	Opposite the twenty cubits which belonged to the inner court, and opposite the pavement which belonged to the outer court, was gallery corresponding to gallery in three stories.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	42	4	Before the chambers was an inner walk ten cubits wide, a way of one hundred cubits; and their openings were on the north.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	42	5	Now the upper chambers were smaller because the galleries took more space away from them than from the lower and middle ones in the building.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	42	6	For they were in three stories and had no pillars like the pillars of the courts; therefore the upper chambers were set back from the ground upward, more than the lower and middle ones.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	42	7	As for the outer wall by the side of the chambers, toward the outer court facing the chambers, its length was fifty cubits.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	42	8	For the length of the chambers which were in the outer court was fifty cubits; and behold, the length of those facing the temple was a hundred cubits.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	42	9	Below these chambers was the entrance on the east side, as one enters them from the outer court.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	42	10	In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, facing the separate area and facing the building, there were chambers.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	42	11	The way in front of them was like the appearance of the chambers which were on the north, according to their length so was their width, and all their exits were both according to their arrangements and openings.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	42	12	Corresponding to the openings of the chambers which were toward the south was an opening at the head of the way, the way in front of the wall toward the east, as one enters them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	42	13	Then he said to me, "The north chambers and the south chambers, which are opposite the separate area, they are the holy chambers where the priests who are near to the LORD shall eat the most holy things. There they shall lay the most holy things, the grain offering, the sin offering and the guilt offering; for the place is holy.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	42	14	"When the priests enter, then they shall not go out into the outer court from the sanctuary without laying there their garments in which they minister, for they are holy. They shall put on other garments; then they shall approach that which is for the people."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	42	15	Now when he had finished measuring the inner house, he brought me out by the way of the gate which faced toward the east and measured it all around.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	42	16	He measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds by the measuring reed.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	42	17	He measured on the north side five hundred reeds by the measuring reed.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	42	18	On the south side he measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	42	19	He turned to the west side and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	42	20	He measured it on the four sides; it had a wall all around, the length five hundred and the width five hundred, to divide between the holy and the profane.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	43	1	Then he led me to the gate, the gate facing toward the east;
Ezekiel	Eze	26	43	2	and behold, the glory of the God of Israel was coming from the way of the east. And His voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth shone with His glory.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	43	3	And it was like the appearance of the vision which I saw, like the vision which I saw when He came to destroy the city. And the visions were like the vision which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	43	4	And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the gate facing toward the east.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	43	5	And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	43	6	Then I heard one speaking to me from the house, while a man was standing beside me.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	43	7	He said to me, "Son of man, this is the place of My throne and the place of the soles of My feet, where I will dwell among the sons of Israel forever. And the house of Israel will not again defile My holy name, neither they nor their kings, by their harlotry and by the corpses of their kings when they die,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	43	8	by setting their threshold by My threshold and their door post beside My door post, with only the wall between Me and them. And they have defiled My holy name by their abominations which they have committed. So I have consumed them in My anger.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	43	9	"Now let them put away their harlotry and the corpses of their kings far from Me; and I will dwell among them forever.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	43	10	"As for you, son of man, describe the temple to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them measure the plan.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	43	11	"If they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the design of the house, its structure, its exits, its entrances, all its designs, all its statutes, and all its laws. And write it in their sight, so that they may observe its whole design and all its statutes and do them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	43	12	"This is the law of the house: its entire area on the top of the mountain all around shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	43	13	"And these are the measurements of the altar by cubits (the cubit being a cubit and a handbreadth): the base shall be a cubit and the width a cubit, and its border on its edge round about one span; and this shall be the height of the base of the altar.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	43	14	"From the base on the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits and the width one cubit; and from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge shall be four cubits and the width one cubit.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	43	15	"The altar hearth shall be four cubits; and from the altar hearth shall extend upwards four horns.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	43	16	"Now the altar hearth shall be twelve cubits long by twelve wide, square in its four sides.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	43	17	"The ledge shall be fourteen cubits long by fourteen wide in its four sides, the border around it shall be half a cubit and its base shall be a cubit round about; and its steps shall face the east."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	43	18	And He said to me, "Son of man, thus says the Lord GOD, 'These are the statutes for the altar on the day it is built, to offer burnt offerings on it and to sprinkle blood on it.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	43	19	'You shall give to the Levitical priests who are from the offspring of Zadok, who draw near to Me to minister to Me,' declares the Lord GOD, 'a young bull for a sin offering.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	43	20	'You shall take some of its blood and put it on its four horns and on the four corners of the ledge and on the border round about; thus you shall cleanse it and make atonement for it.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	43	21	'You shall also take the bull for the sin offering, and it shall be burned in the appointed place of the house, outside the sanctuary.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	43	22	'On the second day you shall offer a male goat without blemish for a sin offering, and they shall cleanse the altar as they cleansed it with the bull.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	43	23	'When you have finished cleansing it, you shall present a young bull without blemish and a ram without blemish from the flock.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	43	24	'You shall present them before the LORD, and the priests shall throw salt on them, and they shall offer them up as a burnt offering to the LORD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	43	25	'For seven days you shall prepare daily a goat for a sin offering; also a young bull and a ram from the flock, without blemish, shall be prepared.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	43	26	'For seven days they shall make atonement for the altar and purify it; so shall they consecrate it.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	43	27	'When they have completed the days, it shall be that on the eighth day and onward, the priests shall offer your burnt offerings on the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you,' declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	44	1	Then He brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary, which faces the east; and it was shut.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	44	2	The LORD said to me, "This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened, and no one shall enter by it, for the LORD God of Israel has entered by it; therefore it shall be shut.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	44	3	"As for the prince, he shall sit in it as prince to eat bread before the LORD; he shall enter by way of the porch of the gate and shall go out by the same way."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	44	4	Then He brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the house; and I looked, and behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD, and I fell on my face.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	44	5	The LORD said to me, "Son of man, mark well, see with your eyes and hear with your ears all that I say to you concerning all the statutes of the house of the LORD and concerning all its laws; and mark well the entrance of the house, with all exits of the sanctuary.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	44	6	"You shall say to the rebellious ones, to the house of Israel, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Enough of all your abominations, O house of Israel,
Ezekiel	Eze	26	44	7	when you brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in My sanctuary to profane it, even My house, when you offered My food, the fat and the blood; for they made My covenant void--this in addition to all your abominations.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	44	8	"And you have not kept charge of My holy things yourselves, but you have set foreigners to keep charge of My sanctuary."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	44	9	'Thus says the Lord GOD, "No foreigner uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, of all the foreigners who are among the sons of Israel, shall enter My sanctuary.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	44	10	"But the Levites who went far from Me when Israel went astray, who went astray from Me after their idols, shall bear the punishment for their iniquity.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	44	11	"Yet they shall be ministers in My sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the house and ministering in the house; they shall slaughter the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister to them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	44	12	"Because they ministered to them before their idols and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel, therefore I have sworn against them," declares the Lord GOD, "that they shall bear the punishment for their iniquity.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	44	13	"And they shall not come near to Me to serve as a priest to Me, nor come near to any of My holy things, to the things that are most holy; but they will bear their shame and their abominations which they have committed.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	44	14	"Yet I will appoint them to keep charge of the house, of all its service and of all that shall be done in it.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	44	15	"But the Levitical priests, the sons of Zadok, who kept charge of My sanctuary when the sons of Israel went astray from Me, shall come near to Me to minister to Me; and they shall stand before Me to offer Me the fat and the blood," declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	44	16	"They shall enter My sanctuary; they shall come near to My table to minister to Me and keep My charge.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	44	17	"It shall be that when they enter at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and wool shall not be on them while they are ministering in the gates of the inner court and in the house.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	44	18	"Linen turbans shall be on their heads and linen undergarments shall be on their loins; they shall not gird themselves with anything which makes them sweat.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	44	19	"When they go out into the outer court, into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments in which they have been ministering and lay them in the holy chambers; then they shall put on other garments so that they will not transmit holiness to the people with their garments.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	44	20	"Also they shall not shave their heads, yet they shall not let their locks grow long; they shall only trim the hair of their heads.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	44	21	"Nor shall any of the priests drink wine when they enter the inner court.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	44	22	"And they shall not marry a widow or a divorced woman but shall take virgins from the offspring of the house of Israel, or a widow who is the widow of a priest.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	44	23	"Moreover, they shall teach My people the difference between the holy and the profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	44	24	"In a dispute they shall take their stand to judge; they shall judge it according to My ordinances. They shall also keep My laws and My statutes in all My appointed feasts and sanctify My sabbaths.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	44	25	"They shall not go to a dead person to defile themselves; however, for father, for mother, for son, for daughter, for brother, or for a sister who has not had a husband, they may defile themselves.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	44	26	"After he is cleansed, seven days shall elapse for him.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	44	27	"On the day that he goes into the sanctuary, into the inner court to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering," declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	44	28	"And it shall be with regard to an inheritance for them, that I am their inheritance; and you shall give them no possession in Israel--I am their possession.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	44	29	"They shall eat the grain offering, the sin offering and the guilt offering; and every devoted thing in Israel shall be theirs.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	44	30	"The first of all the first fruits of every kind and every contribution of every kind, from all your contributions, shall be for the priests; you shall also give to the priest the first of your dough to cause a blessing to rest on your house.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	44	31	"The priests shall not eat any bird or beast that has died a natural death or has been torn to pieces.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	45	1	"And when you divide by lot the land for inheritance, you shall offer an allotment to the LORD, a holy portion of the land; the length shall be the length of 25,cubits, and the width shall be 20,000. It shall be holy within all its boundary round about.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	45	2	"Out of this there shall be for the holy place a square round about five hundred by five hundred cubits, and fifty cubits for its open space round about.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	45	3	"From this area you shall measure a length of 25,cubits and a width of 10,000 cubits; and in it shall be the sanctuary, the most holy place.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	45	4	"It shall be the holy portion of the land; it shall be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, who come near to minister to the LORD, and it shall be a place for their houses and a holy place for the sanctuary.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	45	5	"An area 25,cubits in length and 10,000 in width shall be for the Levites, the ministers of the house, and for their possession cities to dwell in.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	45	6	"You shall give the city possession of an area 5,cubits wide and 25,000 cubits long, alongside the allotment of the holy portion; it shall be for the whole house of Israel.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	45	7	"The prince shall have land on either side of the holy allotment and the property of the city, adjacent to the holy allotment and the property of the city, on the west side toward the west and on the east side toward the east, and in length comparable to one of the portions, from the west border to the east border.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	45	8	"This shall be his land for a possession in Israel; so My princes shall no longer oppress My people, but they shall give the rest of the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	45	9	'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Enough, you princes of Israel; put away violence and destruction, and practice justice and righteousness. Stop your expropriations from My people," declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	45	10	"You shall have just balances, a just ephah and a just bath.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	45	11	"The ephah and the bath shall be the same quantity, so that the bath will contain a tenth of a homer and the ephah a tenth of a homer; their standard shall be according to the homer.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	45	12	"The shekel shall be twenty gerahs; twenty shekels, twenty-five shekels, and fifteen shekels shall be your maneh.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	45	13	"This is the offering that you shall offer: a sixth of an ephah from a homer of wheat; a sixth of an ephah from a homer of barley;
Ezekiel	Eze	26	45	14	and the prescribed portion of oil (namely, the bath of oil), a tenth of a bath from each kor (which is ten baths or a homer, for ten baths are a homer);
Ezekiel	Eze	26	45	15	and one sheep from each flock of two hundred from the watering places of Israel--for a grain offering, for a burnt offering and for peace offerings, to make atonement for them," declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	45	16	"All the people of the land shall give to this offering for the prince in Israel.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	45	17	"It shall be the prince's part to provide the burnt offerings, the grain offerings and the drink offerings, at the feasts, on the new moons and on the sabbaths, at all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel; he shall provide the sin offering, the grain offering, the burnt offering and the peace offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	45	18	'Thus says the Lord GOD, "In the first month, on the first of the month, you shall take a young bull without blemish and cleanse the sanctuary.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	45	19	"The priest shall take some of the blood from the sin offering and put it on the door posts of the house, on the four corners of the ledge of the altar and on the posts of the gate of the inner court.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	45	20	"Thus you shall do on the seventh day of the month for everyone who goes astray or is naive; so you shall make atonement for the house.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	45	21	"In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, you shall have the Passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	45	22	"On that day the prince shall provide for himself and all the people of the land a bull for a sin offering.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	45	23	"During the seven days of the feast he shall provide as a burnt offering to the LORD seven bulls and seven rams without blemish on every day of the seven days, and a male goat daily for a sin offering.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	45	24	"He shall provide as a grain offering an ephah with a bull, an ephah with a ram and a hin of oil with an ephah.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	45	25	"In the seventh month, on the fifteenth day of the month, at the feast, he shall provide like this, seven days for the sin offering, the burnt offering, the grain offering and the oil."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	46	1	'Thus says the Lord GOD, "The gate of the inner court facing east shall be shut the six working days; but it shall be opened on the sabbath day and opened on the day of the new moon.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	46	2	"The prince shall enter by way of the porch of the gate from outside and stand by the post of the gate. Then the priests shall provide his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate and then go out; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	46	3	"The people of the land shall also worship at the doorway of that gate before the LORD on the sabbaths and on the new moons.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	46	4	"The burnt offering which the prince shall offer to the LORD on the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish;
Ezekiel	Eze	26	46	5	and the grain offering shall be an ephah with the ram, and the grain offering with the lambs as much as he is able to give, and a hin of oil with an ephah.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	46	6	"On the day of the new moon he shall offer a young bull without blemish, also six lambs and a ram, which shall be without blemish.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	46	7	"And he shall provide a grain offering, an ephah with the bull and an ephah with the ram, and with the lambs as much as he is able, and a hin of oil with an ephah.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	46	8	"When the prince enters, he shall go in by way of the porch of the gate and go out by the same way.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	46	9	"But when the people of the land come before the LORD at the appointed feasts, he who enters by way of the north gate to worship shall go out by way of the south gate. And he who enters by way of the south gate shall go out by way of the north gate. No one shall return by way of the gate by which he entered but shall go straight out.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	46	10	"When they go in, the prince shall go in among them; and when they go out, he shall go out.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	46	11	"At the festivals and the appointed feasts the grain offering shall be an ephah with a bull and an ephah with a ram, and with the lambs as much as one is able to give, and a hin of oil with an ephah.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	46	12	"When the prince provides a freewill offering, a burnt offering, or peace offerings as a freewill offering to the LORD, the gate facing east shall be opened for him. And he shall provide his burnt offering and his peace offerings as he does on the sabbath day. Then he shall go out, and the gate shall be shut after he goes out.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	46	13	"And you shall provide a lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering to the LORD daily; morning by morning you shall provide it.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	46	14	"Also you shall provide a grain offering with it morning by morning, a sixth of an ephah and a third of a hin of oil to moisten the fine flour, a grain offering to the LORD continually by a perpetual ordinance.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	46	15	"Thus they shall provide the lamb, the grain offering and the oil, morning by morning, for a continual burnt offering."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	46	16	'Thus says the Lord GOD, "If the prince gives a gift out of his inheritance to any of his sons, it shall belong to his sons; it is their possession by inheritance.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	46	17	"But if he gives a gift from his inheritance to one of his servants, it shall be his until the year of liberty; then it shall return to the prince. His inheritance shall be only his sons'; it shall belong to them.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	46	18	"The prince shall not take from the people's inheritance, thrusting them out of their possession; he shall give his sons inheritance from his own possession so that My people will not be scattered, anyone from his possession."'"
Ezekiel	Eze	26	46	19	Then he brought me through the entrance, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers for the priests, which faced north; and behold, there was a place at the extreme rear toward the west.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	46	20	He said to me, "This is the place where the priests shall boil the guilt offering and the sin offering and where they shall bake the grain offering, in order that they may not bring them out into the outer court to transmit holiness to the people."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	46	21	Then he brought me out into the outer court and led me across to the four corners of the court; and behold, in every corner of the court there was a small court.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	46	22	In the four corners of the court there were enclosed courts, forty cubits long and thirty wide; these four in the corners were the same size.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	46	23	There was a row of masonry round about in them, around the four of them, and boiling places were made under the rows round about.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	46	24	Then he said to me, "These are the boiling places where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifices of the people."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	47	1	Then he brought me back to the door of the house; and behold, water was flowing from under the threshold of the house toward the east, for the house faced east. And the water was flowing down from under, from the right side of the house, from south of the altar.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	47	2	He brought me out by way of the north gate and led me around on the outside to the outer gate by way of the gate that faces east. And behold, water was trickling from the south side.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	47	3	When the man went out toward the east with a line in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits, and he led me through the water, water reaching the ankles.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	47	4	Again he measured a thousand and led me through the water, water reaching the knees. Again he measured a thousand and led me through the water, water reaching the loins.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	47	5	Again he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could not ford, for the water had risen, enough water to swim in, a river that could not be forded.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	47	6	He said to me, "Son of man, have you seen this?" Then he brought me back to the bank of the river.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	47	7	Now when I had returned, behold, on the bank of the river there were very many trees on the one side and on the other.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	47	8	Then he said to me, "These waters go out toward the eastern region and go down into the Arabah; then they go toward the sea, being made to flow into the sea, and the waters of the sea become fresh.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	47	9	"It will come about that every living creature which swarms in every place where the river goes, will live. And there will be very many fish, for these waters go there and the others become fresh; so everything will live where the river goes.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	47	10	"And it will come about that fishermen will stand beside it; from Engedi to Eneglaim there will be a place for the spreading of nets. Their fish will be according to their kinds, like the fish of the Great Sea, very many.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	47	11	"But its swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they will be left for salt.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	47	12	"By the river on its bank, on one side and on the other, will grow all kinds of trees for food. Their leaves will not wither and their fruit will not fail. They will bear every month because their water flows from the sanctuary, and their fruit will be for food and their leaves for healing."
Ezekiel	Eze	26	47	13	Thus says the Lord GOD, "This shall be the boundary by which you shall divide the land for an inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel; Joseph shall have two portions.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	47	14	"You shall divide it for an inheritance, each one equally with the other; for I swore to give it to your forefathers, and this land shall fall to you as an inheritance.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	47	15	"This shall be the boundary of the land: on the north side, from the Great Sea by the way of Hethlon, to the entrance of Zedad;
Ezekiel	Eze	26	47	16	Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazer-hatticon, which is by the border of Hauran.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	47	17	"The boundary shall extend from the sea to Hazar-enan at the border of Damascus, and on the north toward the north is the border of Hamath. This is the north side.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	47	18	"The east side, from between Hauran, Damascus, Gilead and the land of Israel, shall be the Jordan; from the north border to the eastern sea you shall measure. This is the east side.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	47	19	"The south side toward the south shall extend from Tamar as far as the waters of Meribath-kadesh, to the brook of Egypt and to the Great Sea. This is the south side toward the south.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	47	20	"The west side shall be the Great Sea, from the south border to a point opposite Lebo-hamath. This is the west side.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	47	21	"So you shall divide this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	47	22	"You shall divide it by lot for an inheritance among yourselves and among the aliens who stay in your midst, who bring forth sons in your midst. And they shall be to you as the native-born among the sons of Israel; they shall be allotted an inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	47	23	"And in the tribe with which the alien stays, there you shall give him his inheritance," declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	48	1	"Now these are the names of the tribes: from the northern extremity, beside the way of Hethlon to Lebo-hamath, as far as Hazar-enan at the border of Damascus, toward the north beside Hamath, running from east to west, Dan, one portion.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	48	2	"Beside the border of Dan, from the east side to the west side, Asher, one portion.

Ezekiel	Eze	26	48	8	"And beside the border of Judah, from the east side to the west side, shall be the allotment which you shall set apart, 25,cubits in width, and in length like one of the portions, from the east side to the west side; and the sanctuary shall be in the middle of it.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	48	9	"The allotment that you shall set apart to the LORD shall be 25,cubits in length and 10,000 in width.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	48	10	"The holy allotment shall be for these, namely for the priests, toward the north 25,cubits in length, toward the west 10,000 in width, toward the east 10,000 in width, and toward the south 25,000 in length; and the sanctuary of the LORD shall be in its midst.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	48	11	"It shall be for the priests who are sanctified of the sons of Zadok, who have kept My charge, who did not go astray when the sons of Israel went astray as the Levites went astray.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	48	12	"It shall be an allotment to them from the allotment of the land, a most holy place, by the border of the Levites.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	48	13	"Alongside the border of the priests the Levites shall have 25,cubits in length and 10,000 in width. The whole length shall be 25,000 cubits and the width 10,000.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	48	14	"Moreover, they shall not sell or exchange any of it, or alienate this choice portion of land; for it is holy to the LORD.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	48	15	"The remainder, 5,cubits in width and 25,000 in length, shall be for common use for the city, for dwellings and for open spaces; and the city shall be in its midst.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	48	16	"These shall be its measurements: the north side 4,cubits, the south side 4,500 cubits, the east side 4,500 cubits, and the west side 4,500 cubits.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	48	17	"The city shall have open spaces: on the north cubits, on the south 250 cubits, on the east 250 cubits, and on the west 250 cubits.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	48	18	"The remainder of the length alongside the holy allotment shall be 10,cubits toward the east and 10,000 toward the west; and it shall be alongside the holy allotment. And its produce shall be food for the workers of the city.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	48	19	"The workers of the city, out of all the tribes of Israel, shall cultivate it.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	48	20	"The whole allotment shall be 25,by 25,000 cubits; you shall set apart the holy allotment, a square, with the property of the city.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	48	21	"The remainder shall be for the prince, on the one side and on the other of the holy allotment and of the property of the city; in front of the 25,cubits of the allotment toward the east border and westward in front of the 25,000 toward the west border, alongside the portions, it shall be for the prince. And the holy allotment and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the middle of it.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	48	22	"Exclusive of the property of the Levites and the property of the city, which are in the middle of that which belongs to the prince, everything between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin shall be for the prince.
Ezekiel	Eze	26	48	23	"As for the rest of the tribes: from the east side to the west side, Benjamin, one portion.

Daniel	Dan	27	1	1	In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it.
Daniel	Dan	27	1	2	The Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, along with some of the vessels of the house of God; and he brought them to the land of Shinar, to the house of his god, and he brought the vessels into the treasury of his god.
Daniel	Dan	27	1	3	Then the king ordered Ashpenaz, the chief of his officials, to bring in some of the sons of Israel, including some of the royal family and of the nobles,
Daniel	Dan	27	1	4	youths in whom was no defect, who were good-looking, showing intelligence in every branch of wisdom, endowed with understanding and discerning knowledge, and who had ability for serving in the king's court; and he ordered him to teach them the literature and language of the Chaldeans.
Daniel	Dan	27	1	5	The king appointed for them a daily ration from the king's choice food and from the wine which he drank, and appointed that they should be educated three years, at the end of which they were to enter the king's personal service.
Daniel	Dan	27	1	6	Now among them from the sons of Judah were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah.
Daniel	Dan	27	1	7	Then the commander of the officials assigned new names to them; and to Daniel he assigned the name Belteshazzar, to Hananiah Shadrach, to Mishael Meshach and to Azariah Abed-nego.
Daniel	Dan	27	1	8	But Daniel made up his mind that he would not defile himself with the king's choice food or with the wine which he drank; so he sought permission from the commander of the officials that he might not defile himself.
Daniel	Dan	27	1	9	Now God granted Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the commander of the officials,
Daniel	Dan	27	1	10	and the commander of the officials said to Daniel, "I am afraid of my lord the king, who has appointed your food and your drink; for why should he see your faces looking more haggard than the youths who are your own age? Then you would make me forfeit my head to the king."
Daniel	Dan	27	1	11	But Daniel said to the overseer whom the commander of the officials had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah,
Daniel	Dan	27	1	12	"Please test your servants for ten days, and let us be given some vegetables to eat and water to drink.
Daniel	Dan	27	1	13	"Then let our appearance be observed in your presence and the appearance of the youths who are eating the king's choice food; and deal with your servants according to what you see."
Daniel	Dan	27	1	14	So he listened to them in this matter and tested them for ten days.
Daniel	Dan	27	1	15	At the end of ten days their appearance seemed better and they were fatter than all the youths who had been eating the king's choice food.
Daniel	Dan	27	1	16	So the overseer continued to withhold their choice food and the wine they were to drink, and kept giving them vegetables.
Daniel	Dan	27	1	17	As for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and intelligence in every branch of literature and wisdom; Daniel even understood all kinds of visions and dreams.
Daniel	Dan	27	1	18	Then at the end of the days which the king had specified for presenting them, the commander of the officials presented them before Nebuchadnezzar.
Daniel	Dan	27	1	19	The king talked with them, and out of them all not one was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah; so they entered the king's personal service.
Daniel	Dan	27	1	20	As for every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king consulted them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and conjurers who were in all his realm.
Daniel	Dan	27	1	21	And Daniel continued until the first year of Cyrus the king.
Daniel	Dan	27	2	1	Now in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; and his spirit was troubled and his sleep left him.
Daniel	Dan	27	2	2	Then the king gave orders to call in the magicians, the conjurers, the sorcerers and the Chaldeans to tell the king his dreams. So they came in and stood before the king.
Daniel	Dan	27	2	3	The king said to them, "I had a dream and my spirit is anxious to understand the dream."
Daniel	Dan	27	2	4	Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic: "O king, live forever! Tell the dream to your servants, and we will declare the interpretation."
Daniel	Dan	27	2	5	The king replied to the Chaldeans, "The command from me is firm: if you do not make known to me the dream and its interpretation, you will be torn limb from limb and your houses will be made a rubbish heap.
Daniel	Dan	27	2	6	"But if you declare the dream and its interpretation, you will receive from me gifts and a reward and great honor; therefore declare to me the dream and its interpretation."
Daniel	Dan	27	2	7	They answered a second time and said, "Let the king tell the dream to his servants, and we will declare the interpretation."
Daniel	Dan	27	2	8	The king replied, "I know for certain that you are bargaining for time, inasmuch as you have seen that the command from me is firm,
Daniel	Dan	27	2	9	that if you do not make the dream known to me, there is only one decree for you. For you have agreed together to speak lying and corrupt words before me until the situation is changed; therefore tell me the dream, that I may know that you can declare to me its interpretation."
Daniel	Dan	27	2	10	The Chaldeans answered the king and said, "There is not a man on earth who could declare the matter for the king, inasmuch as no great king or ruler has ever asked anything like this of any magician, conjurer or Chaldean.
Daniel	Dan	27	2	11	"Moreover, the thing which the king demands is difficult, and there is no one else who could declare it to the king except gods, whose dwelling place is not with mortal flesh."
Daniel	Dan	27	2	12	Because of this the king became indignant and very furious and gave orders to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.
Daniel	Dan	27	2	13	So the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they looked for Daniel and his friends to kill them.
Daniel	Dan	27	2	14	Then Daniel replied with discretion and discernment to Arioch, the captain of the king's bodyguard, who had gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon;
Daniel	Dan	27	2	15	he said to Arioch, the king's commander, "For what reason is the decree from the king so urgent?" Then Arioch informed Daniel about the matter.
Daniel	Dan	27	2	16	So Daniel went in and requested of the king that he would give him time, in order that he might declare the interpretation to the king.
Daniel	Dan	27	2	17	Then Daniel went to his house and informed his friends, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, about the matter,
Daniel	Dan	27	2	18	so that they might request compassion from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his friends would not be destroyed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
Daniel	Dan	27	2	19	Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven;
Daniel	Dan	27	2	20	Daniel said, "Let the name of God be blessed forever and ever, For wisdom and power belong to Him.
Daniel	Dan	27	2	21	"It is He who changes the times and the epochs; He removes kings and establishes kings; He gives wisdom to wise men And knowledge to men of understanding.
Daniel	Dan	27	2	22	"It is He who reveals the profound and hidden things; He knows what is in the darkness, And the light dwells with Him.
Daniel	Dan	27	2	23	"To You, O God of my fathers, I give thanks and praise, For You have given me wisdom and power; Even now You have made known to me what we requested of You, For You have made known to us the king's matter."
Daniel	Dan	27	2	24	Therefore, Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and spoke to him as follows: "Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon! Take me into the king's presence, and I will declare the interpretation to the king."
Daniel	Dan	27	2	25	Then Arioch hurriedly brought Daniel into the king's presence and spoke to him as follows: "I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can make the interpretation known to the king!"
Daniel	Dan	27	2	26	The king said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, "Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen and its interpretation?"
Daniel	Dan	27	2	27	Daniel answered before the king and said, "As for the mystery about which the king has inquired, neither wise men, conjurers, magicians nor diviners are able to declare it to the king.
Daniel	Dan	27	2	28	"However, there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will take place in the latter days. This was your dream and the visions in your mind while on your bed.
Daniel	Dan	27	2	29	"As for you, O king, while on your bed your thoughts turned to what would take place in the future; and He who reveals mysteries has made known to you what will take place.
Daniel	Dan	27	2	30	"But as for me, this mystery has not been revealed to me for any wisdom residing in me more than in any other living man, but for the purpose of making the interpretation known to the king, and that you may understand the thoughts of your mind.
Daniel	Dan	27	2	31	"You, O king, were looking and behold, there was a single great statue; that statue, which was large and of extraordinary splendor, was standing in front of you, and its appearance was awesome.
Daniel	Dan	27	2	32	"The head of that statue was made of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of bronze,
Daniel	Dan	27	2	33	its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay.
Daniel	Dan	27	2	34	"You continued looking until a stone was cut out without hands, and it struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and crushed them.
Daniel	Dan	27	2	35	"Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were crushed all at the same time and became like chaff from the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away so that not a trace of them was found. But the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.
Daniel	Dan	27	2	36	"This was the dream; now we will tell its interpretation before the king.
Daniel	Dan	27	2	37	"You, O king, are the king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, the strength and the glory;
Daniel	Dan	27	2	38	and wherever the sons of men dwell, or the beasts of the field, or the birds of the sky, He has given them into your hand and has caused you to rule over them all. You are the head of gold.
Daniel	Dan	27	2	39	"After you there will arise another kingdom inferior to you, then another third kingdom of bronze, which will rule over all the earth.
Daniel	Dan	27	2	40	"Then there will be a fourth kingdom as strong as iron; inasmuch as iron crushes and shatters all things, so, like iron that breaks in pieces, it will crush and break all these in pieces.
Daniel	Dan	27	2	41	"In that you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter's clay and partly of iron, it will be a divided kingdom; but it will have in it the toughness of iron, inasmuch as you saw the iron mixed with common clay.
Daniel	Dan	27	2	42	"As the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of pottery, so some of the kingdom will be strong and part of it will be brittle.
Daniel	Dan	27	2	43	"And in that you saw the iron mixed with common clay, they will combine with one another in the seed of men; but they will not adhere to one another, even as iron does not combine with pottery.
Daniel	Dan	27	2	44	"In the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which will never be destroyed, and that kingdom will not be left for another people; it will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, but it will itself endure forever.
Daniel	Dan	27	2	45	"Inasmuch as you saw that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it crushed the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold, the great God has made known to the king what will take place in the future; so the dream is true and its interpretation is trustworthy."
Daniel	Dan	27	2	46	Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and did homage to Daniel, and gave orders to present to him an offering and fragrant incense.
Daniel	Dan	27	2	47	The king answered Daniel and said, "Surely your God is a God of gods and a Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries, since you have been able to reveal this mystery."
Daniel	Dan	27	2	48	Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many great gifts, and he made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon.
Daniel	Dan	27	2	49	And Daniel made request of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego over the administration of the province of Babylon, while Daniel was at the king's court.
Daniel	Dan	27	3	1	Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, the height of which was sixty cubits and its width six cubits; he set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon.
Daniel	Dan	27	3	2	Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent word to assemble the satraps, the prefects and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates and all the rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
Daniel	Dan	27	3	3	Then the satraps, the prefects and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates and all the rulers of the provinces were assembled for the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
Daniel	Dan	27	3	4	Then the herald loudly proclaimed: "To you the command is given, O peoples, nations and men of every language,
Daniel	Dan	27	3	5	that at the moment you hear the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, bagpipe and all kinds of music, you are to fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up.
Daniel	Dan	27	3	6	"But whoever does not fall down and worship shall immediately be cast into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire."
Daniel	Dan	27	3	7	Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, bagpipe and all kinds of music, all the peoples, nations and men of every language fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
Daniel	Dan	27	3	8	For this reason at that time certain Chaldeans came forward and brought charges against the Jews.
Daniel	Dan	27	3	9	They responded and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king: "O king, live forever!
Daniel	Dan	27	3	10	"You, O king, have made a decree that every man who hears the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, and bagpipe and all kinds of music, is to fall down and worship the golden image.
Daniel	Dan	27	3	11	"But whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire.
Daniel	Dan	27	3	12	"There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the administration of the province of Babylon, namely Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego. These men, O king, have disregarded you; they do not serve your gods or worship the golden image which you have set up."
Daniel	Dan	27	3	13	Then Nebuchadnezzar in rage and anger gave orders to bring Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego; then these men were brought before the king.
Daniel	Dan	27	3	14	Nebuchadnezzar responded and said to them, "Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden image that I have set up?
Daniel	Dan	27	3	15	"Now if you are ready, at the moment you hear the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery and bagpipe and all kinds of music, to fall down and worship the image that I have made, very well. But if you do not worship, you will immediately be cast into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire; and what god is there who can deliver you out of my hands?"
Daniel	Dan	27	3	16	Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego replied to the king, "O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to give you an answer concerning this matter.
Daniel	Dan	27	3	17	"If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the furnace of blazing fire; and He will deliver us out of your hand, O king.
Daniel	Dan	27	3	18	"But even if He does not, let it be known to you, O king, that we are not going to serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up."
Daniel	Dan	27	3	19	Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with wrath, and his facial expression was altered toward Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego. He answered by giving orders to heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated.
Daniel	Dan	27	3	20	He commanded certain valiant warriors who were in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego in order to cast them into the furnace of blazing fire.
Daniel	Dan	27	3	21	Then these men were tied up in their trousers, their coats, their caps and their other clothes, and were cast into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire.
Daniel	Dan	27	3	22	For this reason, because the king's command was urgent and the furnace had been made extremely hot, the flame of the fire slew those men who carried up Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego.
Daniel	Dan	27	3	23	But these three men, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, fell into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire still tied up.
Daniel	Dan	27	3	24	Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astounded and stood up in haste; he said to his high officials, "Was it not three men we cast bound into the midst of the fire?" They replied to the king, "Certainly, O king."
Daniel	Dan	27	3	25	He said, "Look! I see four men loosed and walking about in the midst of the fire without harm, and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods!"
Daniel	Dan	27	3	26	Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the door of the furnace of blazing fire; he responded and said, "Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, come out, you servants of the Most High God, and come here!" Then Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego came out of the midst of the fire.
Daniel	Dan	27	3	27	The satraps, the prefects, the governors and the king's high officials gathered around and saw in regard to these men that the fire had no effect on the bodies of these men nor was the hair of their head singed, nor were their trousers damaged, nor had the smell of fire even come upon them.
Daniel	Dan	27	3	28	Nebuchadnezzar responded and said, "Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, who has sent His angel and delivered His servants who put their trust in Him, violating the king's command, and yielded up their bodies so as not to serve or worship any god except their own God.
Daniel	Dan	27	3	29	"Therefore I make a decree that any people, nation or tongue that speaks anything offensive against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego shall be torn limb from limb and their houses reduced to a rubbish heap, inasmuch as there is no other god who is able to deliver in this way."
Daniel	Dan	27	3	30	Then the king caused Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego to prosper in the province of Babylon.
Daniel	Dan	27	4	1	Nebuchadnezzar the king to all the peoples, nations, and men of every language that live in all the earth: "May your peace abound!
Daniel	Dan	27	4	2	"It has seemed good to me to declare the signs and wonders which the Most High God has done for me.
Daniel	Dan	27	4	3	"How great are His signs And how mighty are His wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom And His dominion is from generation to generation.
Daniel	Dan	27	4	4	"I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house and flourishing in my palace.
Daniel	Dan	27	4	5	"I saw a dream and it made me fearful; and these fantasies as I lay on my bed and the visions in my mind kept alarming me.
Daniel	Dan	27	4	6	"So I gave orders to bring into my presence all the wise men of Babylon, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream.
Daniel	Dan	27	4	7	"Then the magicians, the conjurers, the Chaldeans and the diviners came in and I related the dream to them, but they could not make its interpretation known to me.
Daniel	Dan	27	4	8	"But finally Daniel came in before me, whose name is Belteshazzar according to the name of my god, and in whom is a spirit of the holy gods; and I related the dream to him, saying,
Daniel	Dan	27	4	9	'O Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, since I know that a spirit of the holy gods is in you and no mystery baffles you, tell me the visions of my dream which I have seen, along with its interpretation.
Daniel	Dan	27	4	10	'Now these were the visions in my mind as I lay on my bed: I was looking, and behold, there was a tree in the midst of the earth and its height was great.
Daniel	Dan	27	4	11	'The tree grew large and became strong And its height reached to the sky, And it was visible to the end of the whole earth.
Daniel	Dan	27	4	12	'Its foliage was beautiful and its fruit abundant, And in it was food for all. The beasts of the field found shade under it, And the birds of the sky dwelt in its branches, And all living creatures fed themselves from it.
Daniel	Dan	27	4	13	'I was looking in the visions in my mind as I lay on my bed, and behold, an angelic watcher, a holy one, descended from heaven.
Daniel	Dan	27	4	14	'He shouted out and spoke as follows: "Chop down the tree and cut off its branches, Strip off its foliage and scatter its fruit; Let the beasts flee from under it And the birds from its branches.
Daniel	Dan	27	4	15	"Yet leave the stump with its roots in the ground, But with a band of iron and bronze around it In the new grass of the field; And let him be drenched with the dew of heaven, And let him share with the beasts in the grass of the earth.
Daniel	Dan	27	4	16	"Let his mind be changed from that of a man And let a beast's mind be given to him, And let seven periods of time pass over him.
Daniel	Dan	27	4	17	"This sentence is by the decree of the angelic watchers And the decision is a command of the holy ones, In order that the living may know That the Most High is ruler over the realm of mankind, And bestows it on whom He wishes And sets over it the lowliest of men."
Daniel	Dan	27	4	18	'This is the dream which I, King Nebuchadnezzar, have seen. Now you, Belteshazzar, tell me its interpretation, inasmuch as none of the wise men of my kingdom is able to make known to me the interpretation; but you are able, for a spirit of the holy gods is in you.'
Daniel	Dan	27	4	19	"Then Daniel, whose name is Belteshazzar, was appalled for a while as his thoughts alarmed him. The king responded and said, 'Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its interpretation alarm you.' Belteshazzar replied, 'My lord, if only the dream applied to those who hate you and its interpretation to your adversaries!
Daniel	Dan	27	4	20	'The tree that you saw, which became large and grew strong, whose height reached to the sky and was visible to all the earth
Daniel	Dan	27	4	21	and whose foliage was beautiful and its fruit abundant, and in which was food for all, under which the beasts of the field dwelt and in whose branches the birds of the sky lodged--
Daniel	Dan	27	4	22	it is you, O king; for you have become great and grown strong, and your majesty has become great and reached to the sky and your dominion to the end of the earth.
Daniel	Dan	27	4	23	'In that the king saw an angelic watcher, a holy one, descending from heaven and saying, "Chop down the tree and destroy it; yet leave the stump with its roots in the ground, but with a band of iron and bronze around it in the new grass of the field, and let him be drenched with the dew of heaven, and let him share with the beasts of the field until seven periods of time pass over him,"
Daniel	Dan	27	4	24	this is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king:
Daniel	Dan	27	4	25	that you be driven away from mankind and your dwelling place be with the beasts of the field, and you be given grass to eat like cattle and be drenched with the dew of heaven; and seven periods of time will pass over you, until you recognize that the Most High is ruler over the realm of mankind and bestows it on whomever He wishes.
Daniel	Dan	27	4	26	'And in that it was commanded to leave the stump with the roots of the tree, your kingdom will be assured to you after you recognize that it is Heaven that rules.
Daniel	Dan	27	4	27	'Therefore, O king, may my advice be pleasing to you: break away now from your sins by doing righteousness and from your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor, in case there may be a prolonging of your prosperity.'
Daniel	Dan	27	4	28	"All this happened to Nebuchadnezzar the king.
Daniel	Dan	27	4	29	"Twelve months later he was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon.
Daniel	Dan	27	4	30	"The king reflected and said, 'Is this not Babylon the great, which I myself have built as a royal residence by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?'
Daniel	Dan	27	4	31	"While the word was in the king's mouth, a voice came from heaven, saying, 'King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is declared: sovereignty has been removed from you,
Daniel	Dan	27	4	32	and you will be driven away from mankind, and your dwelling place will be with the beasts of the field. You will be given grass to eat like cattle, and seven periods of time will pass over you until you recognize that the Most High is ruler over the realm of mankind and bestows it on whomever He wishes.'
Daniel	Dan	27	4	33	"Immediately the word concerning Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled; and he was driven away from mankind and began eating grass like cattle, and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven until his hair had grown like eagles' feathers and his nails like birds' claws.
Daniel	Dan	27	4	34	"But at the end of that period, I, Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes toward heaven and my reason returned to me, and I blessed the Most High and praised and honored Him who lives forever; For His dominion is an everlasting dominion, And His kingdom endures from generation to generation.
Daniel	Dan	27	4	35	"All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, But He does according to His will in the host of heaven And among the inhabitants of earth; And no one can ward off His hand Or say to Him, 'What have You done?'
Daniel	Dan	27	4	36	"At that time my reason returned to me. And my majesty and splendor were restored to me for the glory of my kingdom, and my counselors and my nobles began seeking me out; so I was reestablished in my sovereignty, and surpassing greatness was added to me.
Daniel	Dan	27	4	37	"Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise, exalt and honor the King of heaven, for all His works are true and His ways just, and He is able to humble those who walk in pride."
Daniel	Dan	27	5	1	Belshazzar the king held a great feast for a thousand of his nobles, and he was drinking wine in the presence of the thousand.
Daniel	Dan	27	5	2	When Belshazzar tasted the wine, he gave orders to bring the gold and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem, so that the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines might drink from them.
Daniel	Dan	27	5	3	Then they brought the gold vessels that had been taken out of the temple, the house of God which was in Jerusalem; and the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines drank from them.
Daniel	Dan	27	5	4	They drank the wine and praised the gods of gold and silver, of bronze, iron, wood and stone.
Daniel	Dan	27	5	5	Suddenly the fingers of a man's hand emerged and began writing opposite the lampstand on the plaster of the wall of the king's palace, and the king saw the back of the hand that did the writing.
Daniel	Dan	27	5	6	Then the king's face grew pale and his thoughts alarmed him, and his hip joints went slack and his knees began knocking together.
Daniel	Dan	27	5	7	The king called aloud to bring in the conjurers, the Chaldeans and the diviners. The king spoke and said to the wise men of Babylon, "Any man who can read this inscription and explain its interpretation to me shall be clothed with purple and have a necklace of gold around his neck, and have authority as third ruler in the kingdom."
Daniel	Dan	27	5	8	Then all the king's wise men came in, but they could not read the inscription or make known its interpretation to the king.
Daniel	Dan	27	5	9	Then King Belshazzar was greatly alarmed, his face grew even paler, and his nobles were perplexed.
Daniel	Dan	27	5	10	The queen entered the banquet hall because of the words of the king and his nobles; the queen spoke and said, "O king, live forever! Do not let your thoughts alarm you or your face be pale.
Daniel	Dan	27	5	11	"There is a man in your kingdom in whom is a spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of your father, illumination, insight and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods were found in him. And King Nebuchadnezzar, your father, your father the king, appointed him chief of the magicians, conjurers, Chaldeans and diviners.
Daniel	Dan	27	5	12	"This was because an extraordinary spirit, knowledge and insight, interpretation of dreams, explanation of enigmas and solving of difficult problems were found in this Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Let Daniel now be summoned and he will declare the interpretation."
Daniel	Dan	27	5	13	Then Daniel was brought in before the king. The king spoke and said to Daniel, "Are you that Daniel who is one of the exiles from Judah, whom my father the king brought from Judah?
Daniel	Dan	27	5	14	"Now I have heard about you that a spirit of the gods is in you, and that illumination, insight and extraordinary wisdom have been found in you.
Daniel	Dan	27	5	15	"Just now the wise men and the conjurers were brought in before me that they might read this inscription and make its interpretation known to me, but they could not declare the interpretation of the message.
Daniel	Dan	27	5	16	"But I personally have heard about you, that you are able to give interpretations and solve difficult problems. Now if you are able to read the inscription and make its interpretation known to me, you will be clothed with purple and wear a necklace of gold around your neck, and you will have authority as the third ruler in the kingdom."
Daniel	Dan	27	5	17	Then Daniel answered and said before the king, "Keep your gifts for yourself or give your rewards to someone else; however, I will read the inscription to the king and make the interpretation known to him.
Daniel	Dan	27	5	18	"O king, the Most High God granted sovereignty, grandeur, glory and majesty to Nebuchadnezzar your father.
Daniel	Dan	27	5	19	"Because of the grandeur which He bestowed on him, all the peoples, nations and men of every language feared and trembled before him; whomever he wished he killed and whomever he wished he spared alive; and whomever he wished he elevated and whomever he wished he humbled.
Daniel	Dan	27	5	20	"But when his heart was lifted up and his spirit became so proud that he behaved arrogantly, he was deposed from his royal throne and his glory was taken away from him.
Daniel	Dan	27	5	21	"He was also driven away from mankind, and his heart was made like that of beasts, and his dwelling place was with the wild donkeys. He was given grass to eat like cattle, and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven until he recognized that the Most High God is ruler over the realm of mankind and that He sets over it whomever He wishes.
Daniel	Dan	27	5	22	"Yet you, his son, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, even though you knew all this,
Daniel	Dan	27	5	23	but you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of His house before you, and you and your nobles, your wives and your concubines have been drinking wine from them; and you have praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood and stone, which do not see, hear or understand. But the God in whose hand are your life-breath and all your ways, you have not glorified.
Daniel	Dan	27	5	24	"Then the hand was sent from Him and this inscription was written out.
Daniel	Dan	27	5	25	"Now this is the inscription that was written out: 'MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.'
Daniel	Dan	27	5	26	"This is the interpretation of the message: 'MENE'--God has numbered your kingdom and put an end to it.
Daniel	Dan	27	5	27	" 'TEKEL'--you have been weighed on the scales and found deficient.
Daniel	Dan	27	5	28	" 'PERES'--your kingdom has been divided and given over to the Medes and Persians."
Daniel	Dan	27	5	29	Then Belshazzar gave orders, and they clothed Daniel with purple and put a necklace of gold around his neck, and issued a proclamation concerning him that he now had authority as the third ruler in the kingdom.
Daniel	Dan	27	5	30	That same night Belshazzar the Chaldean king was slain.
Daniel	Dan	27	5	31	So Darius the Mede received the kingdom at about the age of sixty-two.
Daniel	Dan	27	6	1	It seemed good to Darius to appoint satraps over the kingdom, that they would be in charge of the whole kingdom,
Daniel	Dan	27	6	2	and over them three commissioners (of whom Daniel was one), that these satraps might be accountable to them, and that the king might not suffer loss.
Daniel	Dan	27	6	3	Then this Daniel began distinguishing himself among the commissioners and satraps because he possessed an extraordinary spirit, and the king planned to appoint him over the entire kingdom.
Daniel	Dan	27	6	4	Then the commissioners and satraps began trying to find a ground of accusation against Daniel in regard to government affairs; but they could find no ground of accusation or evidence of corruption, inasmuch as he was faithful, and no negligence or corruption was to be found in him.
Daniel	Dan	27	6	5	Then these men said, "We will not find any ground of accusation against this Daniel unless we find it against him with regard to the law of his God."
Daniel	Dan	27	6	6	Then these commissioners and satraps came by agreement to the king and spoke to him as follows: "King Darius, live forever!
Daniel	Dan	27	6	7	"All the commissioners of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the high officials and the governors have consulted together that the king should establish a statute and enforce an injunction that anyone who makes a petition to any god or man besides you, O king, for thirty days, shall be cast into the lions' den.
Daniel	Dan	27	6	8	"Now, O king, establish the injunction and sign the document so that it may not be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which may not be revoked."
Daniel	Dan	27	6	9	Therefore King Darius signed the document, that is, the injunction.
Daniel	Dan	27	6	10	Now when Daniel knew that the document was signed, he entered his house (now in his roof chamber he had windows open toward Jerusalem); and he continued kneeling on his knees three times a day, praying and giving thanks before his God, as he had been doing previously.
Daniel	Dan	27	6	11	Then these men came by agreement and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God.
Daniel	Dan	27	6	12	Then they approached and spoke before the king about the king's injunction, "Did you not sign an injunction that any man who makes a petition to any god or man besides you, O king, for thirty days, is to be cast into the lions' den?" The king replied, "The statement is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which may not be revoked."
Daniel	Dan	27	6	13	Then they answered and spoke before the king, "Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, or to the injunction which you signed, but keeps making his petition three times a day."
Daniel	Dan	27	6	14	Then, as soon as the king heard this statement, he was deeply distressed and set his mind on delivering Daniel; and even until sunset he kept exerting himself to rescue him.
Daniel	Dan	27	6	15	Then these men came by agreement to the king and said to the king, "Recognize, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no injunction or statute which the king establishes may be changed."
Daniel	Dan	27	6	16	Then the king gave orders, and Daniel was brought in and cast into the lions' den. The king spoke and said to Daniel, "Your God whom you constantly serve will Himself deliver you."
Daniel	Dan	27	6	17	A stone was brought and laid over the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the signet rings of his nobles, so that nothing would be changed in regard to Daniel.
Daniel	Dan	27	6	18	Then the king went off to his palace and spent the night fasting, and no entertainment was brought before him; and his sleep fled from him.
Daniel	Dan	27	6	19	Then the king arose at dawn, at the break of day, and went in haste to the lions' den.
Daniel	Dan	27	6	20	When he had come near the den to Daniel, he cried out with a troubled voice. The king spoke and said to Daniel, "Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you constantly serve, been able to deliver you from the lions?"
Daniel	Dan	27	6	21	Then Daniel spoke to the king, "O king, live forever!
Daniel	Dan	27	6	22	"My God sent His angel and shut the lions' mouths and they have not harmed me, inasmuch as I was found innocent before Him; and also toward you, O king, I have committed no crime."
Daniel	Dan	27	6	23	Then the king was very pleased and gave orders for Daniel to be taken up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den and no injury whatever was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.
Daniel	Dan	27	6	24	The king then gave orders, and they brought those men who had maliciously accused Daniel, and they cast them, their children and their wives into the lions' den; and they had not reached the bottom of the den before the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones.
Daniel	Dan	27	6	25	Then Darius the king wrote to all the peoples, nations and men of every language who were living in all the land: "May your peace abound!
Daniel	Dan	27	6	26	"I make a decree that in all the dominion of my kingdom men are to fear and tremble before the God of Daniel; For He is the living God and enduring forever, And His kingdom is one which will not be destroyed, And His dominion will be forever.
Daniel	Dan	27	6	27	"He delivers and rescues and performs signs and wonders In heaven and on earth, Who has also delivered Daniel from the power of the lions."
Daniel	Dan	27	6	28	So this Daniel enjoyed success in the reign of Darius and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
Daniel	Dan	27	7	1	In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel saw a dream and visions in his mind as he lay on his bed; then he wrote the dream down and related the following summary of it.
Daniel	Dan	27	7	2	Daniel said, "I was looking in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea.
Daniel	Dan	27	7	3	"And four great beasts were coming up from the sea, different from one another.
Daniel	Dan	27	7	4	"The first was like a lion and had the wings of an eagle. I kept looking until its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man; a human mind also was given to it.
Daniel	Dan	27	7	5	"And behold, another beast, a second one, resembling a bear. And it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth; and thus they said to it, 'Arise, devour much meat!'
Daniel	Dan	27	7	6	"After this I kept looking, and behold, another one, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings of a bird; the beast also had four heads, and dominion was given to it.
Daniel	Dan	27	7	7	"After this I kept looking in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, dreadful and terrifying and extremely strong; and it had large iron teeth. It devoured and crushed and trampled down the remainder with its feet; and it was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns.
Daniel	Dan	27	7	8	"While I was contemplating the horns, behold, another horn, a little one, came up among them, and three of the first horns were pulled out by the roots before it; and behold, this horn possessed eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth uttering great boasts.
Daniel	Dan	27	7	9	"I kept looking Until thrones were set up, And the Ancient of Days took His seat; His vesture was like white snow And the hair of His head like pure wool. His throne was ablaze with flames, Its wheels were a burning fire.
Daniel	Dan	27	7	10	"A river of fire was flowing And coming out from before Him; Thousands upon thousands were attending Him, And myriads upon myriads were standing before Him; The court sat, And the books were opened.
Daniel	Dan	27	7	11	"Then I kept looking because of the sound of the boastful words which the horn was speaking; I kept looking until the beast was slain, and its body was destroyed and given to the burning fire.
Daniel	Dan	27	7	12	"As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but an extension of life was granted to them for an appointed period of time.
Daniel	Dan	27	7	13	"I kept looking in the night visions, And behold, with the clouds of heaven One like a Son of Man was coming, And He came up to the Ancient of Days And was presented before Him.
Daniel	Dan	27	7	14	"And to Him was given dominion, Glory and a kingdom, That all the peoples, nations and men of every language Might serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion Which will not pass away; And His kingdom is one Which will not be destroyed.
Daniel	Dan	27	7	15	"As for me, Daniel, my spirit was distressed within me, and the visions in my mind kept alarming me.
Daniel	Dan	27	7	16	"I approached one of those who were standing by and began asking him the exact meaning of all this. So he told me and made known to me the interpretation of these things:
Daniel	Dan	27	7	17	'These great beasts, which are four in number, are four kings who will arise from the earth.
Daniel	Dan	27	7	18	'But the saints of the Highest One will receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever, for all ages to come.'
Daniel	Dan	27	7	19	"Then I desired to know the exact meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others, exceedingly dreadful, with its teeth of iron and its claws of bronze, and which devoured, crushed and trampled down the remainder with its feet,
Daniel	Dan	27	7	20	and the meaning of the ten horns that were on its head and the other horn which came up, and before which three of them fell, namely, that horn which had eyes and a mouth uttering great boasts and which was larger in appearance than its associates.
Daniel	Dan	27	7	21	"I kept looking, and that horn was waging war with the saints and overpowering them
Daniel	Dan	27	7	22	until the Ancient of Days came and judgment was passed in favor of the saints of the Highest One, and the time arrived when the saints took possession of the kingdom.
Daniel	Dan	27	7	23	"Thus he said: 'The fourth beast will be a fourth kingdom on the earth, which will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth and tread it down and crush it.
Daniel	Dan	27	7	24	'As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings will arise; and another will arise after them, and he will be different from the previous ones and will subdue three kings.
Daniel	Dan	27	7	25	'He will speak out against the Most High and wear down the saints of the Highest One, and he will intend to make alterations in times and in law; and they will be given into his hand for a time, times, and half a time.
Daniel	Dan	27	7	26	'But the court will sit for judgment, and his dominion will be taken away, annihilated and destroyed forever.
Daniel	Dan	27	7	27	'Then the sovereignty, the dominion and the greatness of all the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be given to the people of the saints of the Highest One; His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all the dominions will serve and obey Him.'
Daniel	Dan	27	7	28	"At this point the revelation ended. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts were greatly alarming me and my face grew pale, but I kept the matter to myself."
Daniel	Dan	27	8	1	In the third year of the reign of Belshazzar the king a vision appeared to me, Daniel, subsequent to the one which appeared to me previously.
Daniel	Dan	27	8	2	I looked in the vision, and while I was looking I was in the citadel of Susa, which is in the province of Elam; and I looked in the vision and I myself was beside the Ulai Canal.
Daniel	Dan	27	8	3	Then I lifted my eyes and looked, and behold, a ram which had two horns was standing in front of the canal. Now the two horns were long, but one was longer than the other, with the longer one coming up last.
Daniel	Dan	27	8	4	I saw the ram butting westward, northward, and southward, and no other beasts could stand before him nor was there anyone to rescue from his power, but he did as he pleased and magnified himself.
Daniel	Dan	27	8	5	While I was observing, behold, a male goat was coming from the west over the surface of the whole earth without touching the ground; and the goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes.
Daniel	Dan	27	8	6	He came up to the ram that had the two horns, which I had seen standing in front of the canal, and rushed at him in his mighty wrath.
Daniel	Dan	27	8	7	I saw him come beside the ram, and he was enraged at him; and he struck the ram and shattered his two horns, and the ram had no strength to withstand him. So he hurled him to the ground and trampled on him, and there was none to rescue the ram from his power.
Daniel	Dan	27	8	8	Then the male goat magnified himself exceedingly. But as soon as he was mighty, the large horn was broken; and in its place there came up four conspicuous horns toward the four winds of heaven.
Daniel	Dan	27	8	9	Out of one of them came forth a rather small horn which grew exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east, and toward the Beautiful Land.
Daniel	Dan	27	8	10	It grew up to the host of heaven and caused some of the host and some of the stars to fall to the earth, and it trampled them down.
Daniel	Dan	27	8	11	It even magnified itself to be equal with the Commander of the host; and it removed the regular sacrifice from Him, and the place of His sanctuary was thrown down.
Daniel	Dan	27	8	12	And on account of transgression the host will be given over to the horn along with the regular sacrifice; and it will fling truth to the ground and perform its will and prosper.
Daniel	Dan	27	8	13	Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to that particular one who was speaking, "How long will the vision about the regular sacrifice apply, while the transgression causes horror, so as to allow both the holy place and the host to be trampled?"
Daniel	Dan	27	8	14	He said to me, "For 2,evenings and mornings; then the holy place will be properly restored."
Daniel	Dan	27	8	15	When I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought to understand it; and behold, standing before me was one who looked like a man.
Daniel	Dan	27	8	16	And I heard the voice of a man between the banks of Ulai, and he called out and said, "Gabriel, give this man an understanding of the vision."
Daniel	Dan	27	8	17	So he came near to where I was standing, and when he came I was frightened and fell on my face; but he said to me, "Son of man, understand that the vision pertains to the time of the end."
Daniel	Dan	27	8	18	Now while he was talking with me, I sank into a deep sleep with my face to the ground; but he touched me and made me stand upright.
Daniel	Dan	27	8	19	He said, "Behold, I am going to let you know what will occur at the final period of the indignation, for it pertains to the appointed time of the end.
Daniel	Dan	27	8	20	"The ram which you saw with the two horns represents the kings of Media and Persia.
Daniel	Dan	27	8	21	"The shaggy goat represents the kingdom of Greece, and the large horn that is between his eyes is the first king.
Daniel	Dan	27	8	22	"The broken horn and the four horns that arose in its place represent four kingdoms which will arise from his nation, although not with his power.
Daniel	Dan	27	8	23	"In the latter period of their rule, When the transgressors have run their course, A king will arise, Insolent and skilled in intrigue.
Daniel	Dan	27	8	24	"His power will be mighty, but not by his own power, And he will destroy to an extraordinary degree And prosper and perform his will; He will destroy mighty men and the holy people.
Daniel	Dan	27	8	25	"And through his shrewdness He will cause deceit to succeed by his influence; And he will magnify himself in his heart, And he will destroy many while they are at ease. He will even oppose the Prince of princes, But he will be broken without human agency.
Daniel	Dan	27	8	26	"The vision of the evenings and mornings Which has been told is true; But keep the vision secret, For it pertains to many days in the future."
Daniel	Dan	27	8	27	Then I, Daniel, was exhausted and sick for days. Then I got up again and carried on the king's business; but I was astounded at the vision, and there was none to explain it.
Daniel	Dan	27	9	1	In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of Median descent, who was made king over the kingdom of the Chaldeans--
Daniel	Dan	27	9	2	in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, observed in the books the number of the years which was revealed as the word of the LORD to Jeremiah the prophet for the completion of the desolations of Jerusalem, namely, seventy years.
Daniel	Dan	27	9	3	So I gave my attention to the Lord God to seek Him by prayer and supplications, with fasting, sackcloth and ashes.
Daniel	Dan	27	9	4	I prayed to the LORD my God and confessed and said, "Alas, O Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps His covenant and lovingkindness for those who love Him and keep His commandments,
Daniel	Dan	27	9	5	we have sinned, committed iniquity, acted wickedly and rebelled, even turning aside from Your commandments and ordinances.
Daniel	Dan	27	9	6	"Moreover, we have not listened to Your servants the prophets, who spoke in Your name to our kings, our princes, our fathers and all the people of the land.
Daniel	Dan	27	9	7	"Righteousness belongs to You, O Lord, but to us open shame, as it is this day--to the men of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem and all Israel, those who are nearby and those who are far away in all the countries to which You have driven them, because of their unfaithful deeds which they have committed against You.
Daniel	Dan	27	9	8	"Open shame belongs to us, O Lord, to our kings, our princes and our fathers, because we have sinned against You.
Daniel	Dan	27	9	9	"To the Lord our God belong compassion and forgiveness, for we have rebelled against Him;
Daniel	Dan	27	9	10	nor have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in His teachings which He set before us through His servants the prophets.
Daniel	Dan	27	9	11	"Indeed all Israel has transgressed Your law and turned aside, not obeying Your voice; so the curse has been poured out on us, along with the oath which is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, for we have sinned against Him.
Daniel	Dan	27	9	12	"Thus He has confirmed His words which He had spoken against us and against our rulers who ruled us, to bring on us great calamity; for under the whole heaven there has not been done anything like what was done to Jerusalem.
Daniel	Dan	27	9	13	"As it is written in the law of Moses, all this calamity has come on us; yet we have not sought the favor of the LORD our God by turning from our iniquity and giving attention to Your truth.
Daniel	Dan	27	9	14	"Therefore the LORD has kept the calamity in store and brought it on us; for the LORD our God is righteous with respect to all His deeds which He has done, but we have not obeyed His voice.
Daniel	Dan	27	9	15	"And now, O Lord our God, who have brought Your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and have made a name for Yourself, as it is this day--we have sinned, we have been wicked.
Daniel	Dan	27	9	16	"O Lord, in accordance with all Your righteous acts, let now Your anger and Your wrath turn away from Your city Jerusalem, Your holy mountain; for because of our sins and the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Your people have become a reproach to all those around us.
Daniel	Dan	27	9	17	"So now, our God, listen to the prayer of Your servant and to his supplications, and for Your sake, O Lord, let Your face shine on Your desolate sanctuary.
Daniel	Dan	27	9	18	"O my God, incline Your ear and hear! Open Your eyes and see our desolations and the city which is called by Your name; for we are not presenting our supplications before You on account of any merits of our own, but on account of Your great compassion.
Daniel	Dan	27	9	19	"O Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, listen and take action! For Your own sake, O my God, do not delay, because Your city and Your people are called by Your name."
Daniel	Dan	27	9	20	Now while I was speaking and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God in behalf of the holy mountain of my God,
Daniel	Dan	27	9	21	while I was still speaking in prayer, then the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision previously, came to me in my extreme weariness about the time of the evening offering.
Daniel	Dan	27	9	22	He gave me instruction and talked with me and said, "O Daniel, I have now come forth to give you insight with understanding.
Daniel	Dan	27	9	23	"At the beginning of your supplications the command was issued, and I have come to tell you, for you are highly esteemed; so give heed to the message and gain understanding of the vision.
Daniel	Dan	27	9	24	"Seventy weeks have been decreed for your people and your holy city, to finish the transgression, to make an end of sin, to make atonement for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy place.
Daniel	Dan	27	9	25	"So you are to know and discern that from the issuing of a decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until Messiah the Prince there will be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks; it will be built again, with plaza and moat, even in times of distress.
Daniel	Dan	27	9	26	"Then after the sixty-two weeks the Messiah will be cut off and have nothing, and the people of the prince who is to come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. And its end will come with a flood; even to the end there will be war; desolations are determined.
Daniel	Dan	27	9	27	"And he will make a firm covenant with the many for one week, but in the middle of the week he will put a stop to sacrifice and grain offering; and on the wing of abominations will come one who makes desolate, even until a complete destruction, one that is decreed, is poured out on the one who makes desolate."
Daniel	Dan	27	10	1	In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a message was revealed to Daniel, who was named Belteshazzar; and the message was true and one of great conflict, but he understood the message and had an understanding of the vision.
Daniel	Dan	27	10	2	In those days, I, Daniel, had been mourning for three entire weeks.
Daniel	Dan	27	10	3	I did not eat any tasty food, nor did meat or wine enter my mouth, nor did I use any ointment at all until the entire three weeks were completed.
Daniel	Dan	27	10	4	On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, while I was by the bank of the great river, that is, the Tigris,
Daniel	Dan	27	10	5	I lifted my eyes and looked, and behold, there was a certain man dressed in linen, whose waist was girded with a belt of pure gold of Uphaz.
Daniel	Dan	27	10	6	His body also was like beryl, his face had the appearance of lightning, his eyes were like flaming torches, his arms and feet like the gleam of polished bronze, and the sound of his words like the sound of a tumult.
Daniel	Dan	27	10	7	Now I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, while the men who were with me did not see the vision; nevertheless, a great dread fell on them, and they ran away to hide themselves.
Daniel	Dan	27	10	8	So I was left alone and saw this great vision; yet no strength was left in me, for my natural color turned to a deathly pallor, and I retained no strength.
Daniel	Dan	27	10	9	But I heard the sound of his words; and as soon as I heard the sound of his words, I fell into a deep sleep on my face, with my face to the ground.
Daniel	Dan	27	10	10	Then behold, a hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees.
Daniel	Dan	27	10	11	He said to me, "O Daniel, man of high esteem, understand the words that I am about to tell you and stand upright, for I have now been sent to you." And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood up trembling.
Daniel	Dan	27	10	12	Then he said to me, "Do not be afraid, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart on understanding this and on humbling yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to your words.
Daniel	Dan	27	10	13	"But the prince of the kingdom of Persia was withstanding me for twenty-one days; then behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I had been left there with the kings of Persia.
Daniel	Dan	27	10	14	"Now I have come to give you an understanding of what will happen to your people in the latter days, for the vision pertains to the days yet future."
Daniel	Dan	27	10	15	When he had spoken to me according to these words, I turned my face toward the ground and became speechless.
Daniel	Dan	27	10	16	And behold, one who resembled a human being was touching my lips; then I opened my mouth and spoke and said to him who was standing before me, "O my lord, as a result of the vision anguish has come upon me, and I have retained no strength.
Daniel	Dan	27	10	17	"For how can such a servant of my lord talk with such as my lord? As for me, there remains just now no strength in me, nor has any breath been left in me."
Daniel	Dan	27	10	18	Then this one with human appearance touched me again and strengthened me.
Daniel	Dan	27	10	19	He said, "O man of high esteem, do not be afraid. Peace be with you; take courage and be courageous!" Now as soon as he spoke to me, I received strength and said, "May my lord speak, for you have strengthened me."
Daniel	Dan	27	10	20	Then he said, "Do you understand why I came to you? But I shall now return to fight against the prince of Persia; so I am going forth, and behold, the prince of Greece is about to come.
Daniel	Dan	27	10	21	"However, I will tell you what is inscribed in the writing of truth. Yet there is no one who stands firmly with me against these forces except Michael your prince.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	1	"In the first year of Darius the Mede, I arose to be an encouragement and a protection for him.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	2	"And now I will tell you the truth. Behold, three more kings are going to arise in Persia. Then a fourth will gain far more riches than all of them; as soon as he becomes strong through his riches, he will arouse the whole empire against the realm of Greece.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	3	"And a mighty king will arise, and he will rule with great authority and do as he pleases.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	4	"But as soon as he has arisen, his kingdom will be broken up and parceled out toward the four points of the compass, though not to his own descendants, nor according to his authority which he wielded, for his sovereignty will be uprooted and given to others besides them.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	5	"Then the king of the South will grow strong, along with one of his princes who will gain ascendancy over him and obtain dominion; his domain will be a great dominion indeed.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	6	"After some years they will form an alliance, and the daughter of the king of the South will come to the king of the North to carry out a peaceful arrangement. But she will not retain her position of power, nor will he remain with his power, but she will be given up, along with those who brought her in and the one who sired her as well as he who supported her in those times.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	7	"But one of the descendants of her line will arise in his place, and he will come against their army and enter the fortress of the king of the North, and he will deal with them and display great strength.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	8	"Also their gods with their metal images and their precious vessels of silver and gold he will take into captivity to Egypt, and he on his part will refrain from attacking the king of the North for some years.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	9	"Then the latter will enter the realm of the king of the South, but will return to his own land.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	10	"His sons will mobilize and assemble a multitude of great forces; and one of them will keep on coming and overflow and pass through, that he may again wage war up to his very fortress.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	11	"The king of the South will be enraged and go forth and fight with the king of the North. Then the latter will raise a great multitude, but that multitude will be given into the hand of the former.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	12	"When the multitude is carried away, his heart will be lifted up, and he will cause tens of thousands to fall; yet he will not prevail.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	13	"For the king of the North will again raise a greater multitude than the former, and after an interval of some years he will press on with a great army and much equipment.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	14	"Now in those times many will rise up against the king of the South; the violent ones among your people will also lift themselves up in order to fulfill the vision, but they will fall down.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	15	"Then the king of the North will come, cast up a siege ramp and capture a well-fortified city; and the forces of the South will not stand their ground, not even their choicest troops, for there will be no strength to make a stand.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	16	"But he who comes against him will do as he pleases, and no one will be able to withstand him; he will also stay for a time in the Beautiful Land, with destruction in his hand.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	17	"He will set his face to come with the power of his whole kingdom, bringing with him a proposal of peace which he will put into effect; he will also give him the daughter of women to ruin it. But she will not take a stand for him or be on his side.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	18	"Then he will turn his face to the coastlands and capture many. But a commander will put a stop to his scorn against him; moreover, he will repay him for his scorn.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	19	"So he will turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land, but he will stumble and fall and be found no more.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	20	"Then in his place one will arise who will send an oppressor through the Jewel of his kingdom; yet within a few days he will be shattered, though not in anger nor in battle.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	21	"In his place a despicable person will arise, on whom the honor of kingship has not been conferred, but he will come in a time of tranquility and seize the kingdom by intrigue.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	22	"The overflowing forces will be flooded away before him and shattered, and also the prince of the covenant.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	23	"After an alliance is made with him he will practice deception, and he will go up and gain power with a small force of people.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	24	"In a time of tranquility he will enter the richest parts of the realm, and he will accomplish what his fathers never did, nor his ancestors; he will distribute plunder, booty and possessions among them, and he will devise his schemes against strongholds, but only for a time.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	25	"He will stir up his strength and courage against the king of the South with a large army; so the king of the South will mobilize an extremely large and mighty army for war; but he will not stand, for schemes will be devised against him.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	26	"Those who eat his choice food will destroy him, and his army will overflow, but many will fall down slain.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	27	"As for both kings, their hearts will be intent on evil, and they will speak lies to each other at the same table; but it will not succeed, for the end is still to come at the appointed time.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	28	"Then he will return to his land with much plunder; but his heart will be set against the holy covenant, and he will take action and then return to his own land.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	29	"At the appointed time he will return and come into the South, but this last time it will not turn out the way it did before.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	30	"For ships of Kittim will come against him; therefore he will be disheartened and will return and become enraged at the holy covenant and take action; so he will come back and show regard for those who forsake the holy covenant.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	31	"Forces from him will arise, desecrate the sanctuary fortress, and do away with the regular sacrifice. And they will set up the abomination of desolation.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	32	"By smooth words he will turn to godlessness those who act wickedly toward the covenant, but the people who know their God will display strength and take action.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	33	"Those who have insight among the people will give understanding to the many; yet they will fall by sword and by flame, by captivity and by plunder for many days.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	34	"Now when they fall they will be granted a little help, and many will join with them in hypocrisy.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	35	"Some of those who have insight will fall, in order to refine, purge and make them pure until the end time; because it is still to come at the appointed time.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	36	"Then the king will do as he pleases, and he will exalt and magnify himself above every god and will speak monstrous things against the God of gods; and he will prosper until the indignation is finished, for that which is decreed will be done.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	37	"He will show no regard for the gods of his fathers or for the desire of women, nor will he show regard for any other god; for he will magnify himself above them all.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	38	"But instead he will honor a god of fortresses, a god whom his fathers did not know; he will honor him with gold, silver, costly stones and treasures.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	39	"He will take action against the strongest of fortresses with the help of a foreign god; he will give great honor to those who acknowledge him and will cause them to rule over the many, and will parcel out land for a price.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	40	"At the end time the king of the South will collide with him, and the king of the North will storm against him with chariots, with horsemen and with many ships; and he will enter countries, overflow them and pass through.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	41	"He will also enter the Beautiful Land, and many countries will fall; but these will be rescued out of his hand: Edom, Moab and the foremost of the sons of Ammon.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	42	"Then he will stretch out his hand against other countries, and the land of Egypt will not escape.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	43	"But he will gain control over the hidden treasures of gold and silver and over all the precious things of Egypt; and Libyans and Ethiopians will follow at his heels.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	44	"But rumors from the East and from the North will disturb him, and he will go forth with great wrath to destroy and annihilate many.
Daniel	Dan	27	11	45	"He will pitch the tents of his royal pavilion between the seas and the beautiful Holy Mountain; yet he will come to his end, and no one will help him.
Daniel	Dan	27	12	1	"Now at that time Michael, the great prince who stands guard over the sons of your people, will arise. And there will be a time of distress such as never occurred since there was a nation until that time; and at that time your people, everyone who is found written in the book, will be rescued.
Daniel	Dan	27	12	2	"Many of those who sleep in the dust of the ground will awake, these to everlasting life, but the others to disgrace and everlasting contempt.
Daniel	Dan	27	12	3	"Those who have insight will shine brightly like the brightness of the expanse of heaven, and those who lead the many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever.
Daniel	Dan	27	12	4	"But as for you, Daniel, conceal these words and seal up the book until the end of time; many will go back and forth, and knowledge will increase."
Daniel	Dan	27	12	5	Then I, Daniel, looked and behold, two others were standing, one on this bank of the river and the other on that bank of the river.
Daniel	Dan	27	12	6	And one said to the man dressed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, "How long will it be until the end of these wonders?"
Daniel	Dan	27	12	7	I heard the man dressed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, as he raised his right hand and his left toward heaven, and swore by Him who lives forever that it would be for a time, times, and half a time; and as soon as they finish shattering the power of the holy people, all these events will be completed.
Daniel	Dan	27	12	8	As for me, I heard but could not understand; so I said, "My lord, what will be the outcome of these events?"
Daniel	Dan	27	12	9	He said, "Go your way, Daniel, for these words are concealed and sealed up until the end time.
Daniel	Dan	27	12	10	"Many will be purged, purified and refined, but the wicked will act wickedly; and none of the wicked will understand, but those who have insight will understand.
Daniel	Dan	27	12	11	"From the time that the regular sacrifice is abolished and the abomination of desolation is set up, there will be 1,days.
Daniel	Dan	27	12	12	"How blessed is he who keeps waiting and attains to the 1,days!
Daniel	Dan	27	12	13	"But as for you, go your way to the end; then you will enter into rest and rise again for your allotted portion at the end of the age."
Hosea	Hos	28	1	1	The word of the LORD which came to Hosea the son of Beeri, during the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and during the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.
Hosea	Hos	28	1	2	When the LORD first spoke through Hosea, the LORD said to Hosea, "Go, take to yourself a wife of harlotry and have children of harlotry; for the land commits flagrant harlotry, forsaking the LORD."
Hosea	Hos	28	1	3	So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son.
Hosea	Hos	28	1	4	And the LORD said to him, "Name him Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will punish the house of Jehu for the bloodshed of Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel.
Hosea	Hos	28	1	5	"On that day I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel."
Hosea	Hos	28	1	6	Then she conceived again and gave birth to a daughter. And the LORD said to him, "Name her Lo-ruhamah, for I will no longer have compassion on the house of Israel, that I would ever forgive them.
Hosea	Hos	28	1	7	"But I will have compassion on the house of Judah and deliver them by the LORD their God, and will not deliver them by bow, sword, battle, horses or horsemen."
Hosea	Hos	28	1	8	When she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived and gave birth to a son.
Hosea	Hos	28	1	9	And the LORD said, "Name him Lo-ammi, for you are not My people and I am not your God."
Hosea	Hos	28	1	10	Yet the number of the sons of Israel Will be like the sand of the sea, Which cannot be measured or numbered; And in the place Where it is said to them, "You are not My people," It will be said to them, "You are the sons of the living God."
Hosea	Hos	28	1	11	And the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel will be gathered together, And they will appoint for themselves one leader, And they will go up from the land, For great will be the day of Jezreel.
Hosea	Hos	28	2	1	Say to your brothers, "Ammi," and to your sisters, "Ruhamah."
Hosea	Hos	28	2	2	"Contend with your mother, contend, For she is not my wife, and I am not her husband; And let her put away her harlotry from her face And her adultery from between her breasts,
Hosea	Hos	28	2	3	Or I will strip her naked And expose her as on the day when she was born. I will also make her like a wilderness, Make her like desert land And slay her with thirst.
Hosea	Hos	28	2	4	"Also, I will have no compassion on her children, Because they are children of harlotry.
Hosea	Hos	28	2	5	"For their mother has played the harlot; She who conceived them has acted shamefully. For she said, 'I will go after my lovers, Who give me my bread and my water, My wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.'
Hosea	Hos	28	2	6	"Therefore, behold, I will hedge up her way with thorns, And I will build a wall against her so that she cannot find her paths.
Hosea	Hos	28	2	7	"She will pursue her lovers, but she will not overtake them; And she will seek them, but will not find them. Then she will say, 'I will go back to my first husband, For it was better for me then than now!'
Hosea	Hos	28	2	8	"For she does not know that it was I who gave her the grain, the new wine and the oil, And lavished on her silver and gold, Which they used for Baal.
Hosea	Hos	28	2	9	"Therefore, I will take back My grain at harvest time And My new wine in its season. I will also take away My wool and My flax Given to cover her nakedness.
Hosea	Hos	28	2	10	"And then I will uncover her lewdness In the sight of her lovers, And no one will rescue her out of My hand.
Hosea	Hos	28	2	11	"I will also put an end to all her gaiety, Her feasts, her new moons, her sabbaths And all her festal assemblies.
Hosea	Hos	28	2	12	"I will destroy her vines and fig trees, Of which she said, 'These are my wages Which my lovers have given me.' And I will make them a forest, And the beasts of the field will devour them.
Hosea	Hos	28	2	13	"I will punish her for the days of the Baals When she used to offer sacrifices to them And adorn herself with her earrings and jewelry, And follow her lovers, so that she forgot Me," declares the LORD.
Hosea	Hos	28	2	14	"Therefore, behold, I will allure her, Bring her into the wilderness And speak kindly to her.
Hosea	Hos	28	2	15	"Then I will give her her vineyards from there, And the valley of Achor as a door of hope. And she will sing there as in the days of her youth, As in the day when she came up from the land of Egypt.
Hosea	Hos	28	2	16	"It will come about in that day," declares the LORD, "That you will call Me Ishi And will no longer call Me Baali.
Hosea	Hos	28	2	17	"For I will remove the names of the Baals from her mouth, So that they will be mentioned by their names no more.
Hosea	Hos	28	2	18	"In that day I will also make a covenant for them With the beasts of the field, The birds of the sky And the creeping things of the ground. And I will abolish the bow, the sword and war from the land, And will make them lie down in safety.
Hosea	Hos	28	2	19	"I will betroth you to Me forever; Yes, I will betroth you to Me in righteousness and in justice, In lovingkindness and in compassion,
Hosea	Hos	28	2	20	And I will betroth you to Me in faithfulness. Then you will know the LORD.
Hosea	Hos	28	2	21	"It will come about in that day that I will respond," declares the LORD. "I will respond to the heavens, and they will respond to the earth,
Hosea	Hos	28	2	22	And the earth will respond to the grain, to the new wine and to the oil, And they will respond to Jezreel.
Hosea	Hos	28	2	23	"I will sow her for Myself in the land. I will also have compassion on her who had not obtained compassion, And I will say to those who were not My people, 'You are My people!' And they will say, 'You are my God!'"
Hosea	Hos	28	3	1	Then the LORD said to me, "Go again, love a woman who is loved by her husband, yet an adulteress, even as the LORD loves the sons of Israel, though they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes."
Hosea	Hos	28	3	2	So I bought her for myself for fifteen shekels of silver and a homer and a half of barley.
Hosea	Hos	28	3	3	Then I said to her, "You shall stay with me for many days. You shall not play the harlot, nor shall you have a man; so I will also be toward you."
Hosea	Hos	28	3	4	For the sons of Israel will remain for many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or sacred pillar and without ephod or household idols.
Hosea	Hos	28	3	5	Afterward the sons of Israel will return and seek the LORD their God and David their king; and they will come trembling to the LORD and to His goodness in the last days.
Hosea	Hos	28	4	1	Listen to the word of the LORD, O sons of Israel, For the LORD has a case against the inhabitants of the land, Because there is no faithfulness or kindness Or knowledge of God in the land.
Hosea	Hos	28	4	2	There is swearing, deception, murder, stealing and adultery. They employ violence, so that bloodshed follows bloodshed.
Hosea	Hos	28	4	3	Therefore the land mourns, And everyone who lives in it languishes Along with the beasts of the field and the birds of the sky, And also the fish of the sea disappear.
Hosea	Hos	28	4	4	Yet let no one find fault, and let none offer reproof; For your people are like those who contend with the priest.
Hosea	Hos	28	4	5	So you will stumble by day, And the prophet also will stumble with you by night; And I will destroy your mother.
Hosea	Hos	28	4	6	My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Because you have rejected knowledge, I also will reject you from being My priest. Since you have forgotten the law of your God, I also will forget your children.
Hosea	Hos	28	4	7	The more they multiplied, the more they sinned against Me; I will change their glory into shame.
Hosea	Hos	28	4	8	They feed on the sin of My people And direct their desire toward their iniquity.
Hosea	Hos	28	4	9	And it will be, like people, like priest; So I will punish them for their ways And repay them for their deeds.
Hosea	Hos	28	4	10	They will eat, but not have enough; They will play the harlot, but not increase, Because they have stopped giving heed to the LORD.
Hosea	Hos	28	4	11	Harlotry, wine and new wine take away the understanding.
Hosea	Hos	28	4	12	My people consult their wooden idol, and their diviner's wand informs them; For a spirit of harlotry has led them astray, And they have played the harlot, departing from their God.
Hosea	Hos	28	4	13	They offer sacrifices on the tops of the mountains And burn incense on the hills, Under oak, poplar and terebinth, Because their shade is pleasant. Therefore your daughters play the harlot And your brides commit adultery.
Hosea	Hos	28	4	14	I will not punish your daughters when they play the harlot Or your brides when they commit adultery, For the men themselves go apart with harlots And offer sacrifices with temple prostitutes; So the people without understanding are ruined.
Hosea	Hos	28	4	15	Though you, Israel, play the harlot, Do not let Judah become guilty; Also do not go to Gilgal, Or go up to Beth-aven And take the oath: "As the LORD lives!"
Hosea	Hos	28	4	16	Since Israel is stubborn Like a stubborn heifer, Can the LORD now pasture them Like a lamb in a large field?
Hosea	Hos	28	4	17	Ephraim is joined to idols; Let him alone.
Hosea	Hos	28	4	18	Their liquor gone, They play the harlot continually; Their rulers dearly love shame.
Hosea	Hos	28	4	19	The wind wraps them in its wings, And they will be ashamed because of their sacrifices.
Hosea	Hos	28	5	1	Hear this, O priests! Give heed, O house of Israel! Listen, O house of the king! For the judgment applies to you, For you have been a snare at Mizpah And a net spread out on Tabor.
Hosea	Hos	28	5	2	The revolters have gone deep in depravity, But I will chastise all of them.
Hosea	Hos	28	5	3	I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from Me; For now, O Ephraim, you have played the harlot, Israel has defiled itself.
Hosea	Hos	28	5	4	Their deeds will not allow them To return to their God. For a spirit of harlotry is within them, And they do not know the LORD.
Hosea	Hos	28	5	5	Moreover, the pride of Israel testifies against him, And Israel and Ephraim stumble in their iniquity; Judah also has stumbled with them.
Hosea	Hos	28	5	6	They will go with their flocks and herds To seek the LORD, but they will not find Him; He has withdrawn from them.
Hosea	Hos	28	5	7	They have dealt treacherously against the LORD, For they have borne illegitimate children. Now the new moon will devour them with their land.
Hosea	Hos	28	5	8	Blow the horn in Gibeah, The trumpet in Ramah. Sound an alarm at Beth-aven: "Behind you, Benjamin!"
Hosea	Hos	28	5	9	Ephraim will become a desolation in the day of rebuke; Among the tribes of Israel I declare what is sure.
Hosea	Hos	28	5	10	The princes of Judah have become like those who move a boundary; On them I will pour out My wrath like water.
Hosea	Hos	28	5	11	Ephraim is oppressed, crushed in judgment, Because he was determined to follow man's command.
Hosea	Hos	28	5	12	Therefore I am like a moth to Ephraim And like rottenness to the house of Judah.
Hosea	Hos	28	5	13	When Ephraim saw his sickness, And Judah his wound, Then Ephraim went to Assyria And sent to King Jareb. But he is unable to heal you, Or to cure you of your wound.
Hosea	Hos	28	5	14	For I will be like a lion to Ephraim And like a young lion to the house of Judah. I, even I, will tear to pieces and go away, I will carry away, and there will be none to deliver.
Hosea	Hos	28	5	15	I will go away and return to My place Until they acknowledge their guilt and seek My face; In their affliction they will earnestly seek Me.
Hosea	Hos	28	6	1	"Come, let us return to the LORD. For He has torn us, but He will heal us; He has wounded us, but He will bandage us.
Hosea	Hos	28	6	2	"He will revive us after two days; He will raise us up on the third day, That we may live before Him.
Hosea	Hos	28	6	3	"So let us know, let us press on to know the LORD. His going forth is as certain as the dawn; And He will come to us like the rain, Like the spring rain watering the earth."
Hosea	Hos	28	6	4	What shall I do with you, O Ephraim? What shall I do with you, O Judah? For your loyalty is like a morning cloud And like the dew which goes away early.
Hosea	Hos	28	6	5	Therefore I have hewn them in pieces by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of My mouth; And the judgments on you are like the light that goes forth.
Hosea	Hos	28	6	6	For I delight in loyalty rather than sacrifice, And in the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.
Hosea	Hos	28	6	7	But like Adam they have transgressed the covenant; There they have dealt treacherously against Me.
Hosea	Hos	28	6	8	Gilead is a city of wrongdoers, Tracked with bloody footprints.
Hosea	Hos	28	6	9	And as raiders wait for a man, So a band of priests murder on the way to Shechem; Surely they have committed crime.
Hosea	Hos	28	6	10	In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing; Ephraim's harlotry is there, Israel has defiled itself.
Hosea	Hos	28	6	11	Also, O Judah, there is a harvest appointed for you, When I restore the fortunes of My people.
Hosea	Hos	28	7	1	When I would heal Israel, The iniquity of Ephraim is uncovered, And the evil deeds of Samaria, For they deal falsely; The thief enters in, Bandits raid outside,
Hosea	Hos	28	7	2	And they do not consider in their hearts That I remember all their wickedness. Now their deeds are all around them; They are before My face.
Hosea	Hos	28	7	3	With their wickedness they make the king glad, And the princes with their lies.
Hosea	Hos	28	7	4	They are all adulterers, Like an oven heated by the baker Who ceases to stir up the fire From the kneading of the dough until it is leavened.
Hosea	Hos	28	7	5	On the day of our king, the princes became sick with the heat of wine; He stretched out his hand with scoffers,
Hosea	Hos	28	7	6	For their hearts are like an oven As they approach their plotting; Their anger smolders all night, In the morning it burns like a flaming fire.
Hosea	Hos	28	7	7	All of them are hot like an oven, And they consume their rulers; All their kings have fallen. None of them calls on Me.
Hosea	Hos	28	7	8	Ephraim mixes himself with the nations; Ephraim has become a cake not turned.
Hosea	Hos	28	7	9	Strangers devour his strength, Yet he does not know it; Gray hairs also are sprinkled on him, Yet he does not know it.
Hosea	Hos	28	7	10	Though the pride of Israel testifies against him, Yet they have not returned to the LORD their God, Nor have they sought Him, for all this.
Hosea	Hos	28	7	11	So Ephraim has become like a silly dove, without sense; They call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.
Hosea	Hos	28	7	12	When they go, I will spread My net over them; I will bring them down like the birds of the sky. I will chastise them in accordance with the proclamation to their assembly.
Hosea	Hos	28	7	13	Woe to them, for they have strayed from Me! Destruction is theirs, for they have rebelled against Me! I would redeem them, but they speak lies against Me.
Hosea	Hos	28	7	14	And they do not cry to Me from their heart When they wail on their beds; For the sake of grain and new wine they assemble themselves, They turn away from Me.
Hosea	Hos	28	7	15	Although I trained and strengthened their arms, Yet they devise evil against Me.
Hosea	Hos	28	7	16	They turn, but not upward, They are like a deceitful bow; Their princes will fall by the sword Because of the insolence of their tongue. This will be their derision in the land of Egypt.
Hosea	Hos	28	8	1	Put the trumpet to your lips! Like an eagle the enemy comes against the house of the LORD, Because they have transgressed My covenant And rebelled against My law.
Hosea	Hos	28	8	2	They cry out to Me, "My God, we of Israel know You!"
Hosea	Hos	28	8	3	Israel has rejected the good; The enemy will pursue him.
Hosea	Hos	28	8	4	They have set up kings, but not by Me; They have appointed princes, but I did not know it. With their silver and gold they have made idols for themselves, That they might be cut off.
Hosea	Hos	28	8	5	He has rejected your calf, O Samaria, saying, "My anger burns against them!" How long will they be incapable of innocence?
Hosea	Hos	28	8	6	For from Israel is even this! A craftsman made it, so it is not God; Surely the calf of Samaria will be broken to pieces.
Hosea	Hos	28	8	7	For they sow the wind And they reap the whirlwind. The standing grain has no heads; It yields no grain. Should it yield, strangers would swallow it up.
Hosea	Hos	28	8	8	Israel is swallowed up; They are now among the nations Like a vessel in which no one delights.
Hosea	Hos	28	8	9	For they have gone up to Assyria, Like a wild donkey all alone; Ephraim has hired lovers.
Hosea	Hos	28	8	10	Even though they hire allies among the nations, Now I will gather them up; And they will begin to diminish Because of the burden of the king of princes.
Hosea	Hos	28	8	11	Since Ephraim has multiplied altars for sin, They have become altars of sinning for him.
Hosea	Hos	28	8	12	Though I wrote for him ten thousand precepts of My law, They are regarded as a strange thing.
Hosea	Hos	28	8	13	As for My sacrificial gifts, They sacrifice the flesh and eat it, But the LORD has taken no delight in them. Now He will remember their iniquity, And punish them for their sins; They will return to Egypt.
Hosea	Hos	28	8	14	For Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces; And Judah has multiplied fortified cities, But I will send a fire on its cities that it may consume its palatial dwellings.
Hosea	Hos	28	9	1	Do not rejoice, O Israel, with exultation like the nations! For you have played the harlot, forsaking your God. You have loved harlots' earnings on every threshing floor.
Hosea	Hos	28	9	2	Threshing floor and wine press will not feed them, And the new wine will fail them.
Hosea	Hos	28	9	3	They will not remain in the LORD'S land, But Ephraim will return to Egypt, And in Assyria they will eat unclean food.
Hosea	Hos	28	9	4	They will not pour out drink offerings of wine to the LORD, Their sacrifices will not please Him. Their bread will be like mourners' bread; All who eat of it will be defiled, For their bread will be for themselves alone; It will not enter the house of the LORD.
Hosea	Hos	28	9	5	What will you do on the day of the appointed festival And on the day of the feast of the LORD?
Hosea	Hos	28	9	6	For behold, they will go because of destruction; Egypt will gather them up, Memphis will bury them. Weeds will take over their treasures of silver; Thorns will be in their tents.
Hosea	Hos	28	9	7	The days of punishment have come, The days of retribution have come; Let Israel know this! The prophet is a fool, The inspired man is demented, Because of the grossness of your iniquity, And because your hostility is so great.
Hosea	Hos	28	9	8	Ephraim was a watchman with my God, a prophet; Yet the snare of a bird catcher is in all his ways, And there is only hostility in the house of his God.
Hosea	Hos	28	9	9	They have gone deep in depravity As in the days of Gibeah; He will remember their iniquity, He will punish their sins.
Hosea	Hos	28	9	10	I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your forefathers as the earliest fruit on the fig tree in its first season. But they came to Baal-peor and devoted themselves to shame, And they became as detestable as that which they loved.
Hosea	Hos	28	9	11	As for Ephraim, their glory will fly away like a bird-- No birth, no pregnancy and no conception!
Hosea	Hos	28	9	12	Though they bring up their children, Yet I will bereave them until not a man is left. Yes, woe to them indeed when I depart from them!
Hosea	Hos	28	9	13	Ephraim, as I have seen, Is planted in a pleasant meadow like Tyre; But Ephraim will bring out his children for slaughter.
Hosea	Hos	28	9	14	Give them, O LORD--what will You give? Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.
Hosea	Hos	28	9	15	All their evil is at Gilgal; Indeed, I came to hate them there! Because of the wickedness of their deeds I will drive them out of My house! I will love them no more; All their princes are rebels.
Hosea	Hos	28	9	16	Ephraim is stricken, their root is dried up, They will bear no fruit. Even though they bear children, I will slay the precious ones of their womb.
Hosea	Hos	28	9	17	My God will cast them away Because they have not listened to Him; And they will be wanderers among the nations.
Hosea	Hos	28	10	1	Israel is a luxuriant vine; He produces fruit for himself. The more his fruit, The more altars he made; The richer his land, The better he made the sacred pillars.
Hosea	Hos	28	10	2	Their heart is faithless; Now they must bear their guilt. The LORD will break down their altars And destroy their sacred pillars.
Hosea	Hos	28	10	3	Surely now they will say, "We have no king, For we do not revere the LORD. As for the king, what can he do for us?"
Hosea	Hos	28	10	4	They speak mere words, With worthless oaths they make covenants; And judgment sprouts like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field.
Hosea	Hos	28	10	5	The inhabitants of Samaria will fear For the calf of Beth-aven. Indeed, its people will mourn for it, And its idolatrous priests will cry out over it, Over its glory, since it has departed from it.
Hosea	Hos	28	10	6	The thing itself will be carried to Assyria As tribute to King Jareb; Ephraim will be seized with shame And Israel will be ashamed of its own counsel.
Hosea	Hos	28	10	7	Samaria will be cut off with her king Like a stick on the surface of the water.
Hosea	Hos	28	10	8	Also the high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, will be destroyed; Thorn and thistle will grow on their altars; Then they will say to the mountains, "Cover us!" And to the hills, "Fall on us!"
Hosea	Hos	28	10	9	From the days of Gibeah you have sinned, O Israel; There they stand! Will not the battle against the sons of iniquity overtake them in Gibeah?
Hosea	Hos	28	10	10	When it is My desire, I will chastise them; And the peoples will be gathered against them When they are bound for their double guilt.
Hosea	Hos	28	10	11	Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh, But I will come over her fair neck with a yoke; I will harness Ephraim, Judah will plow, Jacob will harrow for himself.
Hosea	Hos	28	10	12	Sow with a view to righteousness, Reap in accordance with kindness; Break up your fallow ground, For it is time to seek the LORD Until He comes to rain righteousness on you.
Hosea	Hos	28	10	13	You have plowed wickedness, you have reaped injustice, You have eaten the fruit of lies. Because you have trusted in your way, in your numerous warriors,
Hosea	Hos	28	10	14	Therefore a tumult will arise among your people, And all your fortresses will be destroyed, As Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel on the day of battle, When mothers were dashed in pieces with their children.
Hosea	Hos	28	10	15	Thus it will be done to you at Bethel because of your great wickedness. At dawn the king of Israel will be completely cut off.
Hosea	Hos	28	11	1	When Israel was a youth I loved him, And out of Egypt I called My son.
Hosea	Hos	28	11	2	The more they called them, The more they went from them; They kept sacrificing to the Baals And burning incense to idols.
Hosea	Hos	28	11	3	Yet it is I who taught Ephraim to walk, I took them in My arms; But they did not know that I healed them.
Hosea	Hos	28	11	4	I led them with cords of a man, with bonds of love, And I became to them as one who lifts the yoke from their jaws; And I bent down and fed them.
Hosea	Hos	28	11	5	They will not return to the land of Egypt; But Assyria--he will be their king Because they refused to return to Me.
Hosea	Hos	28	11	6	The sword will whirl against their cities, And will demolish their gate bars And consume them because of their counsels.
Hosea	Hos	28	11	7	So My people are bent on turning from Me. Though they call them to the One on high, None at all exalts Him.
Hosea	Hos	28	11	8	How can I give you up, O Ephraim? How can I surrender you, O Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I treat you like Zeboiim? My heart is turned over within Me, All My compassions are kindled.
Hosea	Hos	28	11	9	I will not execute My fierce anger; I will not destroy Ephraim again. For I am God and not man, the Holy One in your midst, And I will not come in wrath.
Hosea	Hos	28	11	10	They will walk after the LORD, He will roar like a lion; Indeed He will roar And His sons will come trembling from the west.
Hosea	Hos	28	11	11	They will come trembling like birds from Egypt And like doves from the land of Assyria; And I will settle them in their houses, declares the LORD.
Hosea	Hos	28	11	12	Ephraim surrounds Me with lies And the house of Israel with deceit; Judah is also unruly against God, Even against the Holy One who is faithful.
Hosea	Hos	28	12	1	Ephraim feeds on wind, And pursues the east wind continually; He multiplies lies and violence. Moreover, he makes a covenant with Assyria, And oil is carried to Egypt.
Hosea	Hos	28	12	2	The LORD also has a dispute with Judah, And will punish Jacob according to his ways; He will repay him according to his deeds.
Hosea	Hos	28	12	3	In the womb he took his brother by the heel, And in his maturity he contended with God.
Hosea	Hos	28	12	4	Yes, he wrestled with the angel and prevailed; He wept and sought His favor. He found Him at Bethel And there He spoke with us,
Hosea	Hos	28	12	5	Even the LORD, the God of hosts, The LORD is His name.
Hosea	Hos	28	12	6	Therefore, return to your God, Observe kindness and justice, And wait for your God continually.
Hosea	Hos	28	12	7	A merchant, in whose hands are false balances, He loves to oppress.
Hosea	Hos	28	12	8	And Ephraim said, "Surely I have become rich, I have found wealth for myself; In all my labors they will find in me No iniquity, which would be sin."
Hosea	Hos	28	12	9	But I have been the LORD your God since the land of Egypt; I will make you live in tents again, As in the days of the appointed festival.
Hosea	Hos	28	12	10	I have also spoken to the prophets, And I gave numerous visions, And through the prophets I gave parables.
Hosea	Hos	28	12	11	Is there iniquity in Gilead? Surely they are worthless. In Gilgal they sacrifice bulls, Yes, their altars are like the stone heaps Beside the furrows of the field.
Hosea	Hos	28	12	12	Now Jacob fled to the land of Aram, And Israel worked for a wife, And for a wife he kept sheep.
Hosea	Hos	28	12	13	But by a prophet the LORD brought Israel from Egypt, And by a prophet he was kept.
Hosea	Hos	28	12	14	Ephraim has provoked to bitter anger; So his Lord will leave his bloodguilt on him And bring back his reproach to him.
Hosea	Hos	28	13	1	When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling. He exalted himself in Israel, But through Baal he did wrong and died.
Hosea	Hos	28	13	2	And now they sin more and more, And make for themselves molten images, Idols skillfully made from their silver, All of them the work of craftsmen. They say of them, "Let the men who sacrifice kiss the calves!"
Hosea	Hos	28	13	3	Therefore they will be like the morning cloud And like dew which soon disappears, Like chaff which is blown away from the threshing floor And like smoke from a chimney.
Hosea	Hos	28	13	4	Yet I have been the LORD your God Since the land of Egypt; And you were not to know any god except Me, For there is no savior besides Me.
Hosea	Hos	28	13	5	I cared for you in the wilderness, In the land of drought.
Hosea	Hos	28	13	6	As they had their pasture, they became satisfied, And being satisfied, their heart became proud; Therefore they forgot Me.
Hosea	Hos	28	13	7	So I will be like a lion to them; Like a leopard I will lie in wait by the wayside.
Hosea	Hos	28	13	8	I will encounter them like a bear robbed of her cubs, And I will tear open their chests; There I will also devour them like a lioness, As a wild beast would tear them.
Hosea	Hos	28	13	9	It is your destruction, O Israel, That you are against Me, against your help.
Hosea	Hos	28	13	10	Where now is your king That he may save you in all your cities, And your judges of whom you requested, "Give me a king and princes"?
Hosea	Hos	28	13	11	I gave you a king in My anger And took him away in My wrath.
Hosea	Hos	28	13	12	The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; His sin is stored up.
Hosea	Hos	28	13	13	The pains of childbirth come upon him; He is not a wise son, For it is not the time that he should delay at the opening of the womb.
Hosea	Hos	28	13	14	Shall I ransom them from the power of Sheol? Shall I redeem them from death? O Death, where are your thorns? O Sheol, where is your sting? Compassion will be hidden from My sight.
Hosea	Hos	28	13	15	Though he flourishes among the reeds, An east wind will come, The wind of the LORD coming up from the wilderness; And his fountain will become dry And his spring will be dried up; It will plunder his treasury of every precious article.
Hosea	Hos	28	13	16	Samaria will be held guilty, For she has rebelled against her God. They will fall by the sword, Their little ones will be dashed in pieces, And their pregnant women will be ripped open.
Hosea	Hos	28	14	1	Return, O Israel, to the LORD your God, For you have stumbled because of your iniquity.
Hosea	Hos	28	14	2	Take words with you and return to the LORD. Say to Him, "Take away all iniquity And receive us graciously, That we may present the fruit of our lips.
Hosea	Hos	28	14	3	"Assyria will not save us, We will not ride on horses; Nor will we say again, 'Our god,' To the work of our hands; For in You the orphan finds mercy."
Hosea	Hos	28	14	4	I will heal their apostasy, I will love them freely, For My anger has turned away from them.
Hosea	Hos	28	14	5	I will be like the dew to Israel; He will blossom like the lily, And he will take root like the cedars of Lebanon.
Hosea	Hos	28	14	6	His shoots will sprout, And his beauty will be like the olive tree And his fragrance like the cedars of Lebanon.
Hosea	Hos	28	14	7	Those who live in his shadow Will again raise grain, And they will blossom like the vine. His renown will be like the wine of Lebanon.
Hosea	Hos	28	14	8	O Ephraim, what more have I to do with idols? It is I who answer and look after you. I am like a luxuriant cypress; From Me comes your fruit.
Hosea	Hos	28	14	9	Whoever is wise, let him understand these things; Whoever is discerning, let him know them. For the ways of the LORD are right, And the righteous will walk in them, But transgressors will stumble in them.
Joel	Joel	29	1	1	The word of the LORD that came to Joel, the son of Pethuel:
Joel	Joel	29	1	2	Hear this, O elders, And listen, all inhabitants of the land. Has anything like this happened in your days Or in your fathers' days?
Joel	Joel	29	1	3	Tell your sons about it, And let your sons tell their sons, And their sons the next generation.
Joel	Joel	29	1	4	What the gnawing locust has left, the swarming locust has eaten; And what the swarming locust has left, the creeping locust has eaten; And what the creeping locust has left, the stripping locust has eaten.
Joel	Joel	29	1	5	Awake, drunkards, and weep; And wail, all you wine drinkers, On account of the sweet wine That is cut off from your mouth.
Joel	Joel	29	1	6	For a nation has invaded my land, Mighty and without number; Its teeth are the teeth of a lion, And it has the fangs of a lioness.
Joel	Joel	29	1	7	It has made my vine a waste And my fig tree splinters. It has stripped them bare and cast them away; Their branches have become white.
Joel	Joel	29	1	8	Wail like a virgin girded with sackcloth For the bridegroom of her youth.
Joel	Joel	29	1	9	The grain offering and the drink offering are cut off From the house of the LORD. The priests mourn, The ministers of the LORD.
Joel	Joel	29	1	10	The field is ruined, The land mourns; For the grain is ruined, The new wine dries up, Fresh oil fails.
Joel	Joel	29	1	11	Be ashamed, O farmers, Wail, O vinedressers, For the wheat and the barley; Because the harvest of the field is destroyed.
Joel	Joel	29	1	12	The vine dries up And the fig tree fails; The pomegranate, the palm also, and the apple tree, All the trees of the field dry up. Indeed, rejoicing dries up From the sons of men.
Joel	Joel	29	1	13	Gird yourselves with sackcloth And lament, O priests; Wail, O ministers of the altar! Come, spend the night in sackcloth O ministers of my God, For the grain offering and the drink offering Are withheld from the house of your God.
Joel	Joel	29	1	14	Consecrate a fast, Proclaim a solemn assembly; Gather the elders And all the inhabitants of the land To the house of the LORD your God, And cry out to the LORD.
Joel	Joel	29	1	15	Alas for the day! For the day of the LORD is near, And it will come as destruction from the Almighty.
Joel	Joel	29	1	16	Has not food been cut off before our eyes, Gladness and joy from the house of our God?
Joel	Joel	29	1	17	The seeds shrivel under their clods; The storehouses are desolate, The barns are torn down, For the grain is dried up.
Joel	Joel	29	1	18	How the beasts groan! The herds of cattle wander aimlessly Because there is no pasture for them; Even the flocks of sheep suffer.
Joel	Joel	29	1	19	To You, O LORD, I cry; For fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness And the flame has burned up all the trees of the field.
Joel	Joel	29	1	20	Even the beasts of the field pant for You; For the water brooks are dried up And fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.
Joel	Joel	29	2	1	Blow a trumpet in Zion, And sound an alarm on My holy mountain! Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble, For the day of the LORD is coming; Surely it is near,
Joel	Joel	29	2	2	A day of darkness and gloom, A day of clouds and thick darkness. As the dawn is spread over the mountains, So there is a great and mighty people; There has never been anything like it, Nor will there be again after it To the years of many generations.
Joel	Joel	29	2	3	A fire consumes before them And behind them a flame burns. The land is like the garden of Eden before them But a desolate wilderness behind them, And nothing at all escapes them.
Joel	Joel	29	2	4	Their appearance is like the appearance of horses; And like war horses, so they run.
Joel	Joel	29	2	5	With a noise as of chariots They leap on the tops of the mountains, Like the crackling of a flame of fire consuming the stubble, Like a mighty people arranged for battle.
Joel	Joel	29	2	6	Before them the people are in anguish; All faces turn pale.
Joel	Joel	29	2	7	They run like mighty men, They climb the wall like soldiers; And they each march in line, Nor do they deviate from their paths.
Joel	Joel	29	2	8	They do not crowd each other, They march everyone in his path; When they burst through the defenses, They do not break ranks.
Joel	Joel	29	2	9	They rush on the city, They run on the wall; They climb into the houses, They enter through the windows like a thief.
Joel	Joel	29	2	10	Before them the earth quakes, The heavens tremble, The sun and the moon grow dark And the stars lose their brightness.
Joel	Joel	29	2	11	The LORD utters His voice before His army; Surely His camp is very great, For strong is he who carries out His word. The day of the LORD is indeed great and very awesome, And who can endure it?
Joel	Joel	29	2	12	"Yet even now," declares the LORD, "Return to Me with all your heart, And with fasting, weeping and mourning;
Joel	Joel	29	2	13	And rend your heart and not your garments." Now return to the LORD your God, For He is gracious and compassionate, Slow to anger, abounding in lovingkindness And relenting of evil.
Joel	Joel	29	2	14	Who knows whether He will not turn and relent And leave a blessing behind Him, Even a grain offering and a drink offering For the LORD your God?
Joel	Joel	29	2	15	Blow a trumpet in Zion, Consecrate a fast, proclaim a solemn assembly,
Joel	Joel	29	2	16	Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, Assemble the elders, Gather the children and the nursing infants. Let the bridegroom come out of his room And the bride out of her bridal chamber.
Joel	Joel	29	2	17	Let the priests, the LORD'S ministers, Weep between the porch and the altar, And let them say, "Spare Your people, O LORD, And do not make Your inheritance a reproach, A byword among the nations. Why should they among the peoples say, 'Where is their God?'"
Joel	Joel	29	2	18	Then the LORD will be zealous for His land And will have pity on His people.
Joel	Joel	29	2	19	The LORD will answer and say to His people, "Behold, I am going to send you grain, new wine and oil, And you will be satisfied in full with them; And I will never again make you a reproach among the nations.
Joel	Joel	29	2	20	"But I will remove the northern army far from you, And I will drive it into a parched and desolate land, And its vanguard into the eastern sea, And its rear guard into the western sea. And its stench will arise and its foul smell will come up, For it has done great things."
Joel	Joel	29	2	21	Do not fear, O land, rejoice and be glad, For the LORD has done great things.
Joel	Joel	29	2	22	Do not fear, beasts of the field, For the pastures of the wilderness have turned green, For the tree has borne its fruit, The fig tree and the vine have yielded in full.
Joel	Joel	29	2	23	So rejoice, O sons of Zion, And be glad in the LORD your God; For He has given you the early rain for your vindication. And He has poured down for you the rain, The early and latter rain as before.
Joel	Joel	29	2	24	The threshing floors will be full of grain, And the vats will overflow with the new wine and oil.
Joel	Joel	29	2	25	"Then I will make up to you for the years That the swarming locust has eaten, The creeping locust, the stripping locust and the gnawing locust, My great army which I sent among you.
Joel	Joel	29	2	26	"You will have plenty to eat and be satisfied And praise the name of the LORD your God, Who has dealt wondrously with you; Then My people will never be put to shame.
Joel	Joel	29	2	27	"Thus you will know that I am in the midst of Israel, And that I am the LORD your God, And there is no other; And My people will never be put to shame.
Joel	Joel	29	2	28	"It will come about after this That I will pour out My Spirit on all mankind; And your sons and daughters will prophesy, Your old men will dream dreams, Your young men will see visions.
Joel	Joel	29	2	29	"Even on the male and female servants I will pour out My Spirit in those days.
Joel	Joel	29	2	30	"I will display wonders in the sky and on the earth, Blood, fire and columns of smoke.
Joel	Joel	29	2	31	"The sun will be turned into darkness And the moon into blood Before the great and awesome day of the LORD comes.
Joel	Joel	29	2	32	"And it will come about that whoever calls on the name of the LORD Will be delivered; For on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem There will be those who escape, As the LORD has said, Even among the survivors whom the LORD calls.
Joel	Joel	29	3	1	"For behold, in those days and at that time, When I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,
Joel	Joel	29	3	2	I will gather all the nations And bring them down to the valley of Jehoshaphat. Then I will enter into judgment with them there On behalf of My people and My inheritance, Israel, Whom they have scattered among the nations; And they have divided up My land.
Joel	Joel	29	3	3	"They have also cast lots for My people, Traded a boy for a harlot And sold a girl for wine that they may drink.
Joel	Joel	29	3	4	"Moreover, what are you to Me, O Tyre, Sidon and all the regions of Philistia? Are you rendering Me a recompense? But if you do recompense Me, swiftly and speedily I will return your recompense on your head.
Joel	Joel	29	3	5	"Since you have taken My silver and My gold, brought My precious treasures to your temples,
Joel	Joel	29	3	6	and sold the sons of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks in order to remove them far from their territory,
Joel	Joel	29	3	7	behold, I am going to arouse them from the place where you have sold them, and return your recompense on your head.
Joel	Joel	29	3	8	"Also I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the sons of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, to a distant nation," for the LORD has spoken.
Joel	Joel	29	3	9	Proclaim this among the nations: Prepare a war; rouse the mighty men! Let all the soldiers draw near, let them come up!
Joel	Joel	29	3	10	Beat your plowshares into swords And your pruning hooks into spears; Let the weak say, "I am a mighty man."
Joel	Joel	29	3	11	Hasten and come, all you surrounding nations, And gather yourselves there. Bring down, O LORD, Your mighty ones.
Joel	Joel	29	3	12	Let the nations be aroused And come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat, For there I will sit to judge All the surrounding nations.
Joel	Joel	29	3	13	Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Come, tread, for the wine press is full; The vats overflow, for their wickedness is great.
Joel	Joel	29	3	14	Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.
Joel	Joel	29	3	15	The sun and moon grow dark And the stars lose their brightness.
Joel	Joel	29	3	16	The LORD roars from Zion And utters His voice from Jerusalem, And the heavens and the earth tremble. But the LORD is a refuge for His people And a stronghold to the sons of Israel.
Joel	Joel	29	3	17	Then you will know that I am the LORD your God, Dwelling in Zion, My holy mountain. So Jerusalem will be holy, And strangers will pass through it no more.
Joel	Joel	29	3	18	And in that day The mountains will drip with sweet wine, And the hills will flow with milk, And all the brooks of Judah will flow with water; And a spring will go out from the house of the LORD To water the valley of Shittim.
Joel	Joel	29	3	19	Egypt will become a waste, And Edom will become a desolate wilderness, Because of the violence done to the sons of Judah, In whose land they have shed innocent blood.
Joel	Joel	29	3	20	But Judah will be inhabited forever And Jerusalem for all generations.
Joel	Joel	29	3	21	And I will avenge their blood which I have not avenged, For the LORD dwells in Zion.
Amos	Amos	30	1	1	The words of Amos, who was among the sheepherders from Tekoa, which he envisioned in visions concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam son of Joash, king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.
Amos	Amos	30	1	2	He said, "The LORD roars from Zion And from Jerusalem He utters His voice; And the shepherds' pasture grounds mourn, And the summit of Carmel dries up."
Amos	Amos	30	1	3	Thus says the LORD, "For three transgressions of Damascus and for four I will not revoke its punishment, Because they threshed Gilead with implements of sharp iron.
Amos	Amos	30	1	4	"So I will send fire upon the house of Hazael And it will consume the citadels of Ben-hadad.
Amos	Amos	30	1	5	"I will also break the gate bar of Damascus, And cut off the inhabitant from the valley of Aven, And him who holds the scepter, from Beth-eden; So the people of Aram will go exiled to Kir," Says the LORD.
Amos	Amos	30	1	6	Thus says the LORD, "For three transgressions of Gaza and for four I will not revoke its punishment, Because they deported an entire population To deliver it up to Edom.
Amos	Amos	30	1	7	"So I will send fire upon the wall of Gaza And it will consume her citadels.
Amos	Amos	30	1	8	"I will also cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, And him who holds the scepter, from Ashkelon; I will even unleash My power upon Ekron, And the remnant of the Philistines will perish," Says the Lord GOD.
Amos	Amos	30	1	9	Thus says the LORD, "For three transgressions of Tyre and for four I will not revoke its punishment, Because they delivered up an entire population to Edom And did not remember the covenant of brotherhood.
Amos	Amos	30	1	10	"So I will send fire upon the wall of Tyre And it will consume her citadels."
Amos	Amos	30	1	11	Thus says the LORD, "For three transgressions of Edom and for four I will not revoke its punishment, Because he pursued his brother with the sword, While he stifled his compassion; His anger also tore continually, And he maintained his fury forever.
Amos	Amos	30	1	12	"So I will send fire upon Teman And it will consume the citadels of Bozrah."
Amos	Amos	30	1	13	Thus says the LORD, "For three transgressions of the sons of Ammon and for four I will not revoke its punishment, Because they ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead In order to enlarge their borders.
Amos	Amos	30	1	14	"So I will kindle a fire on the wall of Rabbah And it will consume her citadels Amid war cries on the day of battle, And a storm on the day of tempest.
Amos	Amos	30	1	15	"Their king will go into exile, He and his princes together," says the LORD.
Amos	Amos	30	2	1	Thus says the LORD, "For three transgressions of Moab and for four I will not revoke its punishment, Because he burned the bones of the king of Edom to lime.
Amos	Amos	30	2	2	"So I will send fire upon Moab And it will consume the citadels of Kerioth; And Moab will die amid tumult, With war cries and the sound of a trumpet.
Amos	Amos	30	2	3	"I will also cut off the judge from her midst And slay all her princes with him," says the LORD.
Amos	Amos	30	2	4	Thus says the LORD, "For three transgressions of Judah and for four I will not revoke its punishment, Because they rejected the law of the LORD And have not kept His statutes; Their lies also have led them astray, Those after which their fathers walked.
Amos	Amos	30	2	5	"So I will send fire upon Judah And it will consume the citadels of Jerusalem."
Amos	Amos	30	2	6	Thus says the LORD, "For three transgressions of Israel and for four I will not revoke its punishment, Because they sell the righteous for money And the needy for a pair of sandals.
Amos	Amos	30	2	7	"These who pant after the very dust of the earth on the head of the helpless Also turn aside the way of the humble; And a man and his father resort to the same girl In order to profane My holy name.
Amos	Amos	30	2	8	"On garments taken as pledges they stretch out beside every altar, And in the house of their God they drink the wine of those who have been fined.
Amos	Amos	30	2	9	"Yet it was I who destroyed the Amorite before them, Though his height was like the height of cedars And he was strong as the oaks; I even destroyed his fruit above and his root below.
Amos	Amos	30	2	10	"It was I who brought you up from the land of Egypt, And I led you in the wilderness forty years That you might take possession of the land of the Amorite.
Amos	Amos	30	2	11	"Then I raised up some of your sons to be prophets And some of your young men to be Nazirites. Is this not so, O sons of Israel?" declares the LORD.
Amos	Amos	30	2	12	"But you made the Nazirites drink wine, And you commanded the prophets saying, 'You shall not prophesy!'
Amos	Amos	30	2	13	"Behold, I am weighted down beneath you As a wagon is weighted down when filled with sheaves.
Amos	Amos	30	2	14	"Flight will perish from the swift, And the stalwart will not strengthen his power, Nor the mighty man save his life.
Amos	Amos	30	2	15	"He who grasps the bow will not stand his ground, The swift of foot will not escape, Nor will he who rides the horse save his life.
Amos	Amos	30	2	16	"Even the bravest among the warriors will flee naked in that day," declares the LORD.
Amos	Amos	30	3	1	Hear this word which the LORD has spoken against you, sons of Israel, against the entire family which He brought up from the land of Egypt:
Amos	Amos	30	3	2	"You only have I chosen among all the families of the earth; Therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities."
Amos	Amos	30	3	3	Do two men walk together unless they have made an appointment?
Amos	Amos	30	3	4	Does a lion roar in the forest when he has no prey? Does a young lion growl from his den unless he has captured something?
Amos	Amos	30	3	5	Does a bird fall into a trap on the ground when there is no bait in it? Does a trap spring up from the earth when it captures nothing at all?
Amos	Amos	30	3	6	If a trumpet is blown in a city will not the people tremble? If a calamity occurs in a city has not the LORD done it?
Amos	Amos	30	3	7	Surely the Lord GOD does nothing Unless He reveals His secret counsel To His servants the prophets.
Amos	Amos	30	3	8	A lion has roared! Who will not fear? The Lord GOD has spoken! Who can but prophesy?
Amos	Amos	30	3	9	Proclaim on the citadels in Ashdod and on the citadels in the land of Egypt and say, "Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria and see the great tumults within her and the oppressions in her midst.
Amos	Amos	30	3	10	"But they do not know how to do what is right," declares the LORD, "these who hoard up violence and devastation in their citadels."
Amos	Amos	30	3	11	Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, "An enemy, even one surrounding the land, Will pull down your strength from you And your citadels will be looted."
Amos	Amos	30	3	12	Thus says the LORD, "Just as the shepherd snatches from the lion's mouth a couple of legs or a piece of an ear, So will the sons of Israel dwelling in Samaria be snatched away-- With the corner of a bed and the cover of a couch!
Amos	Amos	30	3	13	"Hear and testify against the house of Jacob," Declares the Lord GOD, the God of hosts.
Amos	Amos	30	3	14	"For on the day that I punish Israel's transgressions, I will also punish the altars of Bethel; The horns of the altar will be cut off And they will fall to the ground.
Amos	Amos	30	3	15	"I will also smite the winter house together with the summer house; The houses of ivory will also perish And the great houses will come to an end," Declares the LORD.
Amos	Amos	30	4	1	Hear this word, you cows of Bashan who are on the mountain of Samaria, Who oppress the poor, who crush the needy, Who say to your husbands, "Bring now, that we may drink!"
Amos	Amos	30	4	2	The Lord GOD has sworn by His holiness, "Behold, the days are coming upon you When they will take you away with meat hooks, And the last of you with fish hooks.
Amos	Amos	30	4	3	"You will go out through breaches in the walls, Each one straight before her, And you will be cast to Harmon," declares the LORD.
Amos	Amos	30	4	4	"Enter Bethel and transgress; In Gilgal multiply transgression! Bring your sacrifices every morning, Your tithes every three days.
Amos	Amos	30	4	5	"Offer a thank offering also from that which is leavened, And proclaim freewill offerings, make them known. For so you love to do, you sons of Israel," Declares the Lord GOD.
Amos	Amos	30	4	6	"But I gave you also cleanness of teeth in all your cities And lack of bread in all your places, Yet you have not returned to Me," declares the LORD.
Amos	Amos	30	4	7	"Furthermore, I withheld the rain from you While there were still three months until harvest. Then I would send rain on one city And on another city I would not send rain; One part would be rained on, While the part not rained on would dry up.
Amos	Amos	30	4	8	"So two or three cities would stagger to another city to drink water, But would not be satisfied; Yet you have not returned to Me," declares the LORD.
Amos	Amos	30	4	9	"I smote you with scorching wind and mildew; And the caterpillar was devouring Your many gardens and vineyards, fig trees and olive trees; Yet you have not returned to Me," declares the LORD.
Amos	Amos	30	4	10	"I sent a plague among you after the manner of Egypt; I slew your young men by the sword along with your captured horses, And I made the stench of your camp rise up in your nostrils; Yet you have not returned to Me," declares the LORD.
Amos	Amos	30	4	11	"I overthrew you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, And you were like a firebrand snatched from a blaze; Yet you have not returned to Me," declares the LORD.
Amos	Amos	30	4	12	"Therefore thus I will do to you, O Israel; Because I will do this to you, Prepare to meet your God, O Israel."
Amos	Amos	30	4	13	For behold, He who forms mountains and creates the wind And declares to man what are His thoughts, He who makes dawn into darkness And treads on the high places of the earth, The LORD God of hosts is His name.
Amos	Amos	30	5	1	Hear this word which I take up for you as a dirge, O house of Israel:
Amos	Amos	30	5	2	She has fallen, she will not rise again-- The virgin Israel. She lies neglected on her land; There is none to raise her up.
Amos	Amos	30	5	3	For thus says the Lord GOD, "The city which goes forth a thousand strong Will have a hundred left, And the one which goes forth a hundred strong Will have ten left to the house of Israel."
Amos	Amos	30	5	4	For thus says the LORD to the house of Israel, "Seek Me that you may live.
Amos	Amos	30	5	5	"But do not resort to Bethel And do not come to Gilgal, Nor cross over to Beersheba; For Gilgal will certainly go into captivity And Bethel will come to trouble.
Amos	Amos	30	5	6	"Seek the LORD that you may live, Or He will break forth like a fire, O house of Joseph, And it will consume with none to quench it for Bethel,
Amos	Amos	30	5	7	For those who turn justice into wormwood And cast righteousness down to the earth."
Amos	Amos	30	5	8	He who made the Pleiades and Orion And changes deep darkness into morning, Who also darkens day into night, Who calls for the waters of the sea And pours them out on the surface of the earth, The LORD is His name.
Amos	Amos	30	5	9	It is He who flashes forth with destruction upon the strong, So that destruction comes upon the fortress.
Amos	Amos	30	5	10	They hate him who reproves in the gate, And they abhor him who speaks with integrity.
Amos	Amos	30	5	11	Therefore because you impose heavy rent on the poor And exact a tribute of grain from them, Though you have built houses of well-hewn stone, Yet you will not live in them; You have planted pleasant vineyards, yet you will not drink their wine.
Amos	Amos	30	5	12	For I know your transgressions are many and your sins are great, You who distress the righteous and accept bribes And turn aside the poor in the gate.
Amos	Amos	30	5	13	Therefore at such a time the prudent person keeps silent, for it is an evil time.
Amos	Amos	30	5	14	Seek good and not evil, that you may live; And thus may the LORD God of hosts be with you, Just as you have said!
Amos	Amos	30	5	15	Hate evil, love good, And establish justice in the gate! Perhaps the LORD God of hosts May be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.
Amos	Amos	30	5	16	Therefore thus says the LORD God of hosts, the Lord, "There is wailing in all the plazas, And in all the streets they say, 'Alas! Alas!' They also call the farmer to mourning And professional mourners to lamentation.
Amos	Amos	30	5	17	"And in all the vineyards there is wailing, Because I will pass through the midst of you," says the LORD.
Amos	Amos	30	5	18	Alas, you who are longing for the day of the LORD, For what purpose will the day of the LORD be to you? It will be darkness and not light;
Amos	Amos	30	5	19	As when a man flees from a lion And a bear meets him, Or goes home, leans his hand against the wall And a snake bites him.
Amos	Amos	30	5	20	Will not the day of the LORD be darkness instead of light, Even gloom with no brightness in it?
Amos	Amos	30	5	21	"I hate, I reject your festivals, Nor do I delight in your solemn assemblies.
Amos	Amos	30	5	22	"Even though you offer up to Me burnt offerings and your grain offerings, I will not accept them; And I will not even look at the peace offerings of your fatlings.
Amos	Amos	30	5	23	"Take away from Me the noise of your songs; I will not even listen to the sound of your harps.
Amos	Amos	30	5	24	"But let justice roll down like waters And righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.
Amos	Amos	30	5	25	"Did you present Me with sacrifices and grain offerings in the wilderness for forty years, O house of Israel?
Amos	Amos	30	5	26	"You also carried along Sikkuth your king and Kiyyun, your images, the star of your gods which you made for yourselves.
Amos	Amos	30	5	27	"Therefore, I will make you go into exile beyond Damascus," says the LORD, whose name is the God of hosts.
Amos	Amos	30	6	1	Woe to those who are at ease in Zion And to those who feel secure in the mountain of Samaria, The distinguished men of the foremost of nations, To whom the house of Israel comes.
Amos	Amos	30	6	2	Go over to Calneh and look, And go from there to Hamath the great, Then go down to Gath of the Philistines. Are they better than these kingdoms, Or is their territory greater than yours?
Amos	Amos	30	6	3	Do you put off the day of calamity, And would you bring near the seat of violence?
Amos	Amos	30	6	4	Those who recline on beds of ivory And sprawl on their couches, And eat lambs from the flock And calves from the midst of the stall,
Amos	Amos	30	6	5	Who improvise to the sound of the harp, And like David have composed songs for themselves,
Amos	Amos	30	6	6	Who drink wine from sacrificial bowls While they anoint themselves with the finest of oils, Yet they have not grieved over the ruin of Joseph.
Amos	Amos	30	6	7	Therefore, they will now go into exile at the head of the exiles, And the sprawlers' banqueting will pass away.
Amos	Amos	30	6	8	The Lord GOD has sworn by Himself, the LORD God of hosts has declared: "I loathe the arrogance of Jacob, And detest his citadels; Therefore I will deliver up the city and all it contains."
Amos	Amos	30	6	9	And it will be, if ten men are left in one house, they will die.
Amos	Amos	30	6	10	Then one's uncle, or his undertaker, will lift him up to carry out his bones from the house, and he will say to the one who is in the innermost part of the house, "Is anyone else with you?" And that one will say, "No one." Then he will answer, "Keep quiet. For the name of the LORD is not to be mentioned."
Amos	Amos	30	6	11	For behold, the LORD is going to command that the great house be smashed to pieces and the small house to fragments.
Amos	Amos	30	6	12	Do horses run on rocks? Or does one plow them with oxen? Yet you have turned justice into poison And the fruit of righteousness into wormwood,
Amos	Amos	30	6	13	You who rejoice in Lodebar, And say, "Have we not by our own strength taken Karnaim for ourselves?"
Amos	Amos	30	6	14	"For behold, I am going to raise up a nation against you, O house of Israel," declares the LORD God of hosts, "And they will afflict you from the entrance of Hamath To the brook of the Arabah."
Amos	Amos	30	7	1	Thus the Lord GOD showed me, and behold, He was forming a locust-swarm when the spring crop began to sprout. And behold, the spring crop was after the king's mowing.
Amos	Amos	30	7	2	And it came about, when it had finished eating the vegetation of the land, that I said, "Lord GOD, please pardon! How can Jacob stand, For he is small?"
Amos	Amos	30	7	3	The LORD changed His mind about this. "It shall not be," said the LORD.
Amos	Amos	30	7	4	Thus the Lord GOD showed me, and behold, the Lord GOD was calling to contend with them by fire, and it consumed the great deep and began to consume the farm land.
Amos	Amos	30	7	5	Then I said, "Lord GOD, please stop! How can Jacob stand, for he is small?"
Amos	Amos	30	7	6	The LORD changed His mind about this. "This too shall not be," said the Lord GOD.
Amos	Amos	30	7	7	Thus He showed me, and behold, the Lord was standing by a vertical wall with a plumb line in His hand.
Amos	Amos	30	7	8	The LORD said to me, "What do you see, Amos?" And I said, "A plumb line." Then the Lord said, "Behold I am about to put a plumb line In the midst of My people Israel. I will spare them no longer.
Amos	Amos	30	7	9	"The high places of Isaac will be desolated And the sanctuaries of Israel laid waste. Then I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword."
Amos	Amos	30	7	10	Then Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, sent word to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, "Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel; the land is unable to endure all his words.
Amos	Amos	30	7	11	"For thus Amos says, 'Jeroboam will die by the sword and Israel will certainly go from its land into exile.'"
Amos	Amos	30	7	12	Then Amaziah said to Amos, "Go, you seer, flee away to the land of Judah and there eat bread and there do your prophesying!
Amos	Amos	30	7	13	"But no longer prophesy at Bethel, for it is a sanctuary of the king and a royal residence."
Amos	Amos	30	7	14	Then Amos replied to Amaziah, "I am not a prophet, nor am I the son of a prophet; for I am a herdsman and a grower of sycamore figs.
Amos	Amos	30	7	15	"But the LORD took me from following the flock and the LORD said to me, 'Go prophesy to My people Israel.'
Amos	Amos	30	7	16	"Now hear the word of the LORD: you are saying, 'You shall not prophesy against Israel nor shall you speak against the house of Isaac.'
Amos	Amos	30	7	17	"Therefore, thus says the LORD, 'Your wife will become a harlot in the city, your sons and your daughters will fall by the sword, your land will be parceled up by a measuring line and you yourself will die upon unclean soil. Moreover, Israel will certainly go from its land into exile.'"
Amos	Amos	30	8	1	Thus the Lord GOD showed me, and behold, there was a basket of summer fruit.
Amos	Amos	30	8	2	He said, "What do you see, Amos?" And I said, "A basket of summer fruit." Then the LORD said to me, "The end has come for My people Israel. I will spare them no longer.
Amos	Amos	30	8	3	"The songs of the palace will turn to wailing in that day," declares the Lord GOD. "Many will be the corpses; in every place they will cast them forth in silence."
Amos	Amos	30	8	4	Hear this, you who trample the needy, to do away with the humble of the land,
Amos	Amos	30	8	5	saying, "When will the new moon be over, So that we may sell grain, And the sabbath, that we may open the wheat market, To make the bushel smaller and the shekel bigger, And to cheat with dishonest scales,
Amos	Amos	30	8	6	So as to buy the helpless for money And the needy for a pair of sandals, And that we may sell the refuse of the wheat?"
Amos	Amos	30	8	7	The LORD has sworn by the pride of Jacob, "Indeed, I will never forget any of their deeds.
Amos	Amos	30	8	8	"Because of this will not the land quake And everyone who dwells in it mourn? Indeed, all of it will rise up like the Nile, And it will be tossed about And subside like the Nile of Egypt.
Amos	Amos	30	8	9	"It will come about in that day," declares the Lord GOD, "That I will make the sun go down at noon And make the earth dark in broad daylight.
Amos	Amos	30	8	10	"Then I will turn your festivals into mourning And all your songs into lamentation; And I will bring sackcloth on everyone's loins And baldness on every head. And I will make it like a time of mourning for an only son, And the end of it will be like a bitter day.
Amos	Amos	30	8	11	"Behold, days are coming," declares the Lord GOD, "When I will send a famine on the land, Not a famine for bread or a thirst for water, But rather for hearing the words of the LORD.
Amos	Amos	30	8	12	"People will stagger from sea to sea And from the north even to the east; They will go to and fro to seek the word of the LORD, But they will not find it.
Amos	Amos	30	8	13	"In that day the beautiful virgins And the young men will faint from thirst.
Amos	Amos	30	8	14	"As for those who swear by the guilt of Samaria, Who say, 'As your god lives, O Dan,' And, 'As the way of Beersheba lives,' They will fall and not rise again."
Amos	Amos	30	9	1	I saw the Lord standing beside the altar, and He said, "Smite the capitals so that the thresholds will shake, And break them on the heads of them all! Then I will slay the rest of them with the sword; They will not have a fugitive who will flee, Or a refugee who will escape.
Amos	Amos	30	9	2	"Though they dig into Sheol, From there will My hand take them; And though they ascend to heaven, From there will I bring them down.
Amos	Amos	30	9	3	"Though they hide on the summit of Carmel, I will search them out and take them from there; And though they conceal themselves from My sight on the floor of the sea, From there I will command the serpent and it will bite them.
Amos	Amos	30	9	4	"And though they go into captivity before their enemies, From there I will command the sword that it slay them, And I will set My eyes against them for evil and not for good."
Amos	Amos	30	9	5	The Lord GOD of hosts, The One who touches the land so that it melts, And all those who dwell in it mourn, And all of it rises up like the Nile And subsides like the Nile of Egypt;
Amos	Amos	30	9	6	The One who builds His upper chambers in the heavens And has founded His vaulted dome over the earth, He who calls for the waters of the sea And pours them out on the face of the earth, The LORD is His name.
Amos	Amos	30	9	7	"Are you not as the sons of Ethiopia to Me, O sons of Israel?" declares the LORD. "Have I not brought up Israel from the land of Egypt, And the Philistines from Caphtor and the Arameans from Kir?
Amos	Amos	30	9	8	"Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD are on the sinful kingdom, And I will destroy it from the face of the earth; Nevertheless, I will not totally destroy the house of Jacob," Declares the LORD.
Amos	Amos	30	9	9	"For behold, I am commanding, And I will shake the house of Israel among all nations As grain is shaken in a sieve, But not a kernel will fall to the ground.
Amos	Amos	30	9	10	"All the sinners of My people will die by the sword, Those who say, 'The calamity will not overtake or confront us.'
Amos	Amos	30	9	11	"In that day I will raise up the fallen booth of David, And wall up its breaches; I will also raise up its ruins And rebuild it as in the days of old;
Amos	Amos	30	9	12	That they may possess the remnant of Edom And all the nations who are called by My name," Declares the LORD who does this.
Amos	Amos	30	9	13	"Behold, days are coming," declares the LORD, "When the plowman will overtake the reaper And the treader of grapes him who sows seed; When the mountains will drip sweet wine And all the hills will be dissolved.
Amos	Amos	30	9	14	"Also I will restore the captivity of My people Israel, And they will rebuild the ruined cities and live in them; They will also plant vineyards and drink their wine, And make gardens and eat their fruit.
Amos	Amos	30	9	15	"I will also plant them on their land, And they will not again be rooted out from their land Which I have given them," Says the LORD your God.
Obadiah	Obad	31	1	1	The vision of Obadiah. Thus says the Lord GOD concerning Edom-- We have heard a report from the LORD, And an envoy has been sent among the nations saying, "Arise and let us go against her for battle"--
Obadiah	Obad	31	1	2	"Behold, I will make you small among the nations; You are greatly despised.
Obadiah	Obad	31	1	3	"The arrogance of your heart has deceived you, You who live in the clefts of the rock, In the loftiness of your dwelling place, Who say in your heart, 'Who will bring me down to earth?'
Obadiah	Obad	31	1	4	"Though you build high like the eagle, Though you set your nest among the stars, From there I will bring you down," declares the LORD.
Obadiah	Obad	31	1	5	"If thieves came to you, If robbers by night-- O how you will be ruined!-- Would they not steal only until they had enough? If grape gatherers came to you, Would they not leave some gleanings?
Obadiah	Obad	31	1	6	"O how Esau will be ransacked, And his hidden treasures searched out!
Obadiah	Obad	31	1	7	"All the men allied with you Will send you forth to the border, And the men at peace with you Will deceive you and overpower you. They who eat your bread Will set an ambush for you. (There is no understanding in him.)
Obadiah	Obad	31	1	8	"Will I not on that day," declares the LORD, "Destroy wise men from Edom And understanding from the mountain of Esau?
Obadiah	Obad	31	1	9	"Then your mighty men will be dismayed, O Teman, So that everyone may be cut off from the mountain of Esau by slaughter.
Obadiah	Obad	31	1	10	"Because of violence to your brother Jacob, You will be covered with shame, And you will be cut off forever.
Obadiah	Obad	31	1	11	"On the day that you stood aloof, On the day that strangers carried off his wealth, And foreigners entered his gate And cast lots for Jerusalem-- You too were as one of them.
Obadiah	Obad	31	1	12	"Do not gloat over your brother's day, The day of his misfortune. And do not rejoice over the sons of Judah In the day of their destruction; Yes, do not boast In the day of their distress.
Obadiah	Obad	31	1	13	"Do not enter the gate of My people In the day of their disaster. Yes, you, do not gloat over their calamity In the day of their disaster. And do not loot their wealth In the day of their disaster.
Obadiah	Obad	31	1	14	"Do not stand at the fork of the road To cut down their fugitives; And do not imprison their survivors In the day of their distress.
Obadiah	Obad	31	1	15	"For the day of the LORD draws near on all the nations. As you have done, it will be done to you. Your dealings will return on your own head.
Obadiah	Obad	31	1	16	"Because just as you drank on My holy mountain, All the nations will drink continually. They will drink and swallow And become as if they had never existed.
Obadiah	Obad	31	1	17	"But on Mount Zion there will be those who escape, And it will be holy. And the house of Jacob will possess their possessions.
Obadiah	Obad	31	1	18	"Then the house of Jacob will be a fire And the house of Joseph a flame; But the house of Esau will be as stubble. And they will set them on fire and consume them, So that there will be no survivor of the house of Esau," For the LORD has spoken.
Obadiah	Obad	31	1	19	Then those of the Negev will possess the mountain of Esau, And those of the Shephelah the Philistine plain; Also, possess the territory of Ephraim and the territory of Samaria, And Benjamin will possess Gilead.
Obadiah	Obad	31	1	20	And the exiles of this host of the sons of Israel, Who are among the Canaanites as far as Zarephath, And the exiles of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad Will possess the cities of the Negev.
Obadiah	Obad	31	1	21	The deliverers will ascend Mount Zion To judge the mountain of Esau, And the kingdom will be the LORD'S.
Jonah	Jonah	32	1	1	The word of the LORD came to Jonah the son of Amittai saying,
Jonah	Jonah	32	1	2	"Arise, go to Nineveh the great city and cry against it, for their wickedness has come up before Me."
Jonah	Jonah	32	1	3	But Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD. So he went down to Joppa, found a ship which was going to Tarshish, paid the fare and went down into it to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD.
Jonah	Jonah	32	1	4	The LORD hurled a great wind on the sea and there was a great storm on the sea so that the ship was about to break up.
Jonah	Jonah	32	1	5	Then the sailors became afraid and every man cried to his god, and they threw the cargo which was in the ship into the sea to lighten it for them. But Jonah had gone below into the hold of the ship, lain down and fallen sound asleep.
Jonah	Jonah	32	1	6	So the captain approached him and said, "How is it that you are sleeping? Get up, call on your god. Perhaps your god will be concerned about us so that we will not perish."
Jonah	Jonah	32	1	7	Each man said to his mate, "Come, let us cast lots so we may learn on whose account this calamity has struck us." So they cast lots and the lot fell on Jonah.
Jonah	Jonah	32	1	8	Then they said to him, "Tell us, now! On whose account has this calamity struck us? What is your occupation? And where do you come from? What is your country? From what people are you?"
Jonah	Jonah	32	1	9	He said to them, "I am a Hebrew, and I fear the LORD God of heaven who made the sea and the dry land."
Jonah	Jonah	32	1	10	Then the men became extremely frightened and they said to him, "How could you do this?" For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them.
Jonah	Jonah	32	1	11	So they said to him, "What should we do to you that the sea may become calm for us?"--for the sea was becoming increasingly stormy.
Jonah	Jonah	32	1	12	He said to them, "Pick me up and throw me into the sea. Then the sea will become calm for you, for I know that on account of me this great storm has come upon you."
Jonah	Jonah	32	1	13	However, the men rowed desperately to return to land but they could not, for the sea was becoming even stormier against them.
Jonah	Jonah	32	1	14	Then they called on the LORD and said, "We earnestly pray, O LORD, do not let us perish on account of this man's life and do not put innocent blood on us; for You, O LORD, have done as You have pleased."
Jonah	Jonah	32	1	15	So they picked up Jonah, threw him into the sea, and the sea stopped its raging.
Jonah	Jonah	32	1	16	Then the men feared the LORD greatly, and they offered a sacrifice to the LORD and made vows.
Jonah	Jonah	32	1	17	And the LORD appointed a great fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was in the stomach of the fish three days and three nights.
Jonah	Jonah	32	2	1	Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from the stomach of the fish,
Jonah	Jonah	32	2	2	and he said, "I called out of my distress to the LORD, And He answered me. I cried for help from the depth of Sheol; You heard my voice.
Jonah	Jonah	32	2	3	"For You had cast me into the deep, Into the heart of the seas, And the current engulfed me. All Your breakers and billows passed over me.
Jonah	Jonah	32	2	4	"So I said, 'I have been expelled from Your sight. Nevertheless I will look again toward Your holy temple.'
Jonah	Jonah	32	2	5	"Water encompassed me to the point of death. The great deep engulfed me, Weeds were wrapped around my head.
Jonah	Jonah	32	2	6	"I descended to the roots of the mountains. The earth with its bars was around me forever, But You have brought up my life from the pit, O LORD my God.
Jonah	Jonah	32	2	7	"While I was fainting away, I remembered the LORD, And my prayer came to You, Into Your holy temple.
Jonah	Jonah	32	2	8	"Those who regard vain idols Forsake their faithfulness,
Jonah	Jonah	32	2	9	But I will sacrifice to You With the voice of thanksgiving. That which I have vowed I will pay. Salvation is from the LORD."
Jonah	Jonah	32	2	10	Then the LORD commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah up onto the dry land.
Jonah	Jonah	32	3	1	Now the word of the LORD came to Jonah the second time, saying,
Jonah	Jonah	32	3	2	"Arise, go to Nineveh the great city and proclaim to it the proclamation which I am going to tell you."
Jonah	Jonah	32	3	3	So Jonah arose and went to Nineveh according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceedingly great city, a three days' walk.
Jonah	Jonah	32	3	4	Then Jonah began to go through the city one day's walk; and he cried out and said, "Yet forty days and Nineveh will be overthrown."
Jonah	Jonah	32	3	5	Then the people of Nineveh believed in God; and they called a fast and put on sackcloth from the greatest to the least of them.
Jonah	Jonah	32	3	6	When the word reached the king of Nineveh, he arose from his throne, laid aside his robe from him, covered himself with sackcloth and sat on the ashes.
Jonah	Jonah	32	3	7	He issued a proclamation and it said, "In Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles: Do not let man, beast, herd, or flock taste a thing. Do not let them eat or drink water.
Jonah	Jonah	32	3	8	"But both man and beast must be covered with sackcloth; and let men call on God earnestly that each may turn from his wicked way and from the violence which is in his hands.
Jonah	Jonah	32	3	9	"Who knows, God may turn and relent and withdraw His burning anger so that we will not perish."
Jonah	Jonah	32	3	10	When God saw their deeds, that they turned from their wicked way, then God relented concerning the calamity which He had declared He would bring upon them. And He did not do it.
Jonah	Jonah	32	4	1	But it greatly displeased Jonah and he became angry.
Jonah	Jonah	32	4	2	He prayed to the LORD and said, "Please LORD, was not this what I said while I was still in my own country? Therefore in order to forestall this I fled to Tarshish, for I knew that You are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness, and one who relents concerning calamity.
Jonah	Jonah	32	4	3	"Therefore now, O LORD, please take my life from me, for death is better to me than life."
Jonah	Jonah	32	4	4	The LORD said, "Do you have good reason to be angry?"
Jonah	Jonah	32	4	5	Then Jonah went out from the city and sat east of it. There he made a shelter for himself and sat under it in the shade until he could see what would happen in the city.
Jonah	Jonah	32	4	6	So the LORD God appointed a plant and it grew up over Jonah to be a shade over his head to deliver him from his discomfort. And Jonah was extremely happy about the plant.
Jonah	Jonah	32	4	7	But God appointed a worm when dawn came the next day and it attacked the plant and it withered.
Jonah	Jonah	32	4	8	When the sun came up God appointed a scorching east wind, and the sun beat down on Jonah's head so that he became faint and begged with all his soul to die, saying, "Death is better to me than life."
Jonah	Jonah	32	4	9	Then God said to Jonah, "Do you have good reason to be angry about the plant?" And he said, "I have good reason to be angry, even to death."
Jonah	Jonah	32	4	10	Then the LORD said, "You had compassion on the plant for which you did not work and which you did not cause to grow, which came up overnight and perished overnight.
Jonah	Jonah	32	4	11	"Should I not have compassion on Nineveh, the great city in which there are more than 120,persons who do not know the difference between their right and left hand, as well as many animals?"
Micah	Mic	33	1	1	The word of the LORD which came to Micah of Moresheth in the days of Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.
Micah	Mic	33	1	2	Hear, O peoples, all of you; Listen, O earth and all it contains, And let the Lord GOD be a witness against you, The Lord from His holy temple.
Micah	Mic	33	1	3	For behold, the LORD is coming forth from His place. He will come down and tread on the high places of the earth.
Micah	Mic	33	1	4	The mountains will melt under Him And the valleys will be split, Like wax before the fire, Like water poured down a steep place.
Micah	Mic	33	1	5	All this is for the rebellion of Jacob And for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the rebellion of Jacob? Is it not Samaria? What is the high place of Judah? Is it not Jerusalem?
Micah	Mic	33	1	6	For I will make Samaria a heap of ruins in the open country, Planting places for a vineyard. I will pour her stones down into the valley And will lay bare her foundations.
Micah	Mic	33	1	7	All of her idols will be smashed, All of her earnings will be burned with fire And all of her images I will make desolate, For she collected them from a harlot's earnings, And to the earnings of a harlot they will return.
Micah	Mic	33	1	8	Because of this I must lament and wail, I must go barefoot and naked; I must make a lament like the jackals And a mourning like the ostriches.
Micah	Mic	33	1	9	For her wound is incurable, For it has come to Judah; It has reached the gate of my people, Even to Jerusalem.
Micah	Mic	33	1	10	Tell it not in Gath, Weep not at all. At Beth-le-aphrah roll yourself in the dust.
Micah	Mic	33	1	11	Go on your way, inhabitant of Shaphir, in shameful nakedness. The inhabitant of Zaanan does not escape. The lamentation of Beth-ezel: "He will take from you its support."
Micah	Mic	33	1	12	For the inhabitant of Maroth Becomes weak waiting for good, Because a calamity has come down from the LORD To the gate of Jerusalem.
Micah	Mic	33	1	13	Harness the chariot to the team of horses, O inhabitant of Lachish-- She was the beginning of sin To the daughter of Zion-- Because in you were found The rebellious acts of Israel.
Micah	Mic	33	1	14	Therefore you will give parting gifts On behalf of Moresheth-gath; The houses of Achzib will become a deception To the kings of Israel.
Micah	Mic	33	1	15	Moreover, I will bring on you The one who takes possession, O inhabitant of Mareshah. The glory of Israel will enter Adullam.
Micah	Mic	33	1	16	Make yourself bald and cut off your hair, Because of the children of your delight; Extend your baldness like the eagle, For they will go from you into exile.
Micah	Mic	33	2	1	Woe to those who scheme iniquity, Who work out evil on their beds! When morning comes, they do it, For it is in the power of their hands.
Micah	Mic	33	2	2	They covet fields and then seize them, And houses, and take them away. They rob a man and his house, A man and his inheritance.
Micah	Mic	33	2	3	Therefore thus says the LORD, "Behold, I am planning against this family a calamity From which you cannot remove your necks; And you will not walk haughtily, For it will be an evil time.
Micah	Mic	33	2	4	"On that day they will take up against you a taunt And utter a bitter lamentation and say, 'We are completely destroyed! He exchanges the portion of my people; How He removes it from me! To the apostate He apportions our fields.'
Micah	Mic	33	2	5	"Therefore you will have no one stretching a measuring line For you by lot in the assembly of the LORD.
Micah	Mic	33	2	6	'Do not speak out,' so they speak out. But if they do not speak out concerning these things, Reproaches will not be turned back.
Micah	Mic	33	2	7	"Is it being said, O house of Jacob: 'Is the Spirit of the LORD impatient? Are these His doings?' Do not My words do good To the one walking uprightly?
Micah	Mic	33	2	8	"Recently My people have arisen as an enemy-- You strip the robe off the garment From unsuspecting passers-by, From those returned from war.
Micah	Mic	33	2	9	"The women of My people you evict, Each one from her pleasant house. From her children you take My splendor forever.
Micah	Mic	33	2	10	"Arise and go, For this is no place of rest Because of the uncleanness that brings on destruction, A painful destruction.
Micah	Mic	33	2	11	"If a man walking after wind and falsehood Had told lies and said, 'I will speak out to you concerning wine and liquor,' He would be spokesman to this people.
Micah	Mic	33	2	12	"I will surely assemble all of you, Jacob, I will surely gather the remnant of Israel. I will put them together like sheep in the fold; Like a flock in the midst of its pasture They will be noisy with men.
Micah	Mic	33	2	13	"The breaker goes up before them; They break out, pass through the gate and go out by it. So their king goes on before them, And the LORD at their head."
Micah	Mic	33	3	1	And I said, "Hear now, heads of Jacob And rulers of the house of Israel. Is it not for you to know justice?
Micah	Mic	33	3	2	"You who hate good and love evil, Who tear off their skin from them And their flesh from their bones,
Micah	Mic	33	3	3	Who eat the flesh of my people, Strip off their skin from them, Break their bones And chop them up as for the pot And as meat in a kettle."
Micah	Mic	33	3	4	Then they will cry out to the LORD, But He will not answer them. Instead, He will hide His face from them at that time Because they have practiced evil deeds.
Micah	Mic	33	3	5	Thus says the LORD concerning the prophets who lead my people astray; When they have something to bite with their teeth, They cry, "Peace," But against him who puts nothing in their mouths They declare holy war.
Micah	Mic	33	3	6	Therefore it will be night for you--without vision, And darkness for you--without divination. The sun will go down on the prophets, And the day will become dark over them.
Micah	Mic	33	3	7	The seers will be ashamed And the diviners will be embarrassed. Indeed, they will all cover their mouths Because there is no answer from God.
Micah	Mic	33	3	8	On the other hand I am filled with power-- With the Spirit of the LORD-- And with justice and courage To make known to Jacob his rebellious act, Even to Israel his sin.
Micah	Mic	33	3	9	Now hear this, heads of the house of Jacob And rulers of the house of Israel, Who abhor justice And twist everything that is straight,
Micah	Mic	33	3	10	Who build Zion with bloodshed And Jerusalem with violent injustice.
Micah	Mic	33	3	11	Her leaders pronounce judgment for a bribe, Her priests instruct for a price And her prophets divine for money. Yet they lean on the LORD saying, "Is not the LORD in our midst? Calamity will not come upon us."
Micah	Mic	33	3	12	Therefore, on account of you Zion will be plowed as a field, Jerusalem will become a heap of ruins, And the mountain of the temple will become high places of a forest.
Micah	Mic	33	4	1	And it will come about in the last days That the mountain of the house of the LORD Will be established as the chief of the mountains. It will be raised above the hills, And the peoples will stream to it.
Micah	Mic	33	4	2	Many nations will come and say, "Come and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD And to the house of the God of Jacob, That He may teach us about His ways And that we may walk in His paths." For from Zion will go forth the law, Even the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
Micah	Mic	33	4	3	And He will judge between many peoples And render decisions for mighty, distant nations. Then they will hammer their swords into plowshares And their spears into pruning hooks; Nation will not lift up sword against nation, And never again will they train for war.
Micah	Mic	33	4	4	Each of them will sit under his vine And under his fig tree, With no one to make them afraid, For the mouth of the LORD of hosts has spoken.
Micah	Mic	33	4	5	Though all the peoples walk Each in the name of his god, As for us, we will walk In the name of the LORD our God forever and ever.
Micah	Mic	33	4	6	"In that day," declares the LORD, "I will assemble the lame And gather the outcasts, Even those whom I have afflicted.
Micah	Mic	33	4	7	"I will make the lame a remnant And the outcasts a strong nation, And the LORD will reign over them in Mount Zion From now on and forever.
Micah	Mic	33	4	8	"As for you, tower of the flock, Hill of the daughter of Zion, To you it will come-- Even the former dominion will come, The kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.
Micah	Mic	33	4	9	"Now, why do you cry out loudly? Is there no king among you, Or has your counselor perished, That agony has gripped you like a woman in childbirth?
Micah	Mic	33	4	10	"Writhe and labor to give birth, Daughter of Zion, Like a woman in childbirth; For now you will go out of the city, Dwell in the field, And go to Babylon. There you will be rescued; There the LORD will redeem you From the hand of your enemies.
Micah	Mic	33	4	11	"And now many nations have been assembled against you Who say, 'Let her be polluted, And let our eyes gloat over Zion.'
Micah	Mic	33	4	12	"But they do not know the thoughts of the LORD, And they do not understand His purpose; For He has gathered them like sheaves to the threshing floor.
Micah	Mic	33	4	13	"Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion, For your horn I will make iron And your hoofs I will make bronze, That you may pulverize many peoples, That you may devote to the LORD their unjust gain And their wealth to the Lord of all the earth.
Micah	Mic	33	5	1	"Now muster yourselves in troops, daughter of troops; They have laid siege against us; With a rod they will smite the judge of Israel on the cheek.
Micah	Mic	33	5	2	"But as for you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, Too little to be among the clans of Judah, From you One will go forth for Me to be ruler in Israel. His goings forth are from long ago, From the days of eternity."
Micah	Mic	33	5	3	Therefore He will give them up until the time When she who is in labor has borne a child. Then the remainder of His brethren Will return to the sons of Israel.
Micah	Mic	33	5	4	And He will arise and shepherd His flock In the strength of the LORD, In the majesty of the name of the LORD His God. And they will remain, Because at that time He will be great To the ends of the earth.
Micah	Mic	33	5	5	This One will be our peace. When the Assyrian invades our land, When he tramples on our citadels, Then we will raise against him Seven shepherds and eight leaders of men.
Micah	Mic	33	5	6	They will shepherd the land of Assyria with the sword, The land of Nimrod at its entrances; And He will deliver us from the Assyrian When he attacks our land And when he tramples our territory.
Micah	Mic	33	5	7	Then the remnant of Jacob Will be among many peoples Like dew from the LORD, Like showers on vegetation Which do not wait for man Or delay for the sons of men.
Micah	Mic	33	5	8	The remnant of Jacob Will be among the nations, Among many peoples Like a lion among the beasts of the forest, Like a young lion among flocks of sheep, Which, if he passes through, Tramples down and tears, And there is none to rescue.
Micah	Mic	33	5	9	Your hand will be lifted up against your adversaries, And all your enemies will be cut off.
Micah	Mic	33	5	10	"It will be in that day," declares the LORD, "That I will cut off your horses from among you And destroy your chariots.
Micah	Mic	33	5	11	"I will also cut off the cities of your land And tear down all your fortifications.
Micah	Mic	33	5	12	"I will cut off sorceries from your hand, And you will have fortune-tellers no more.
Micah	Mic	33	5	13	"I will cut off your carved images And your sacred pillars from among you, So that you will no longer bow down To the work of your hands.
Micah	Mic	33	5	14	"I will root out your Asherim from among you And destroy your cities.
Micah	Mic	33	5	15	"And I will execute vengeance in anger and wrath On the nations which have not obeyed."
Micah	Mic	33	6	1	Hear now what the LORD is saying, "Arise, plead your case before the mountains, And let the hills hear your voice.
Micah	Mic	33	6	2	"Listen, you mountains, to the indictment of the LORD, And you enduring foundations of the earth, Because the LORD has a case against His people; Even with Israel He will dispute.
Micah	Mic	33	6	3	"My people, what have I done to you, And how have I wearied you? Answer Me.
Micah	Mic	33	6	4	"Indeed, I brought you up from the land of Egypt And ransomed you from the house of slavery, And I sent before you Moses, Aaron and Miriam.
Micah	Mic	33	6	5	"My people, remember now What Balak king of Moab counseled And what Balaam son of Beor answered him, And from Shittim to Gilgal, So that you might know the righteous acts of the LORD."
Micah	Mic	33	6	6	With what shall I come to the LORD And bow myself before the God on high? Shall I come to Him with burnt offerings, With yearling calves?
Micah	Mic	33	6	7	Does the LORD take delight in thousands of rams, In ten thousand rivers of oil? Shall I present my firstborn for my rebellious acts, The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
Micah	Mic	33	6	8	He has told you, O man, what is good; And what does the LORD require of you But to do justice, to love kindness, And to walk humbly with your God?
Micah	Mic	33	6	9	The voice of the LORD will call to the city-- And it is sound wisdom to fear Your name: "Hear, O tribe. Who has appointed its time?
Micah	Mic	33	6	10	"Is there yet a man in the wicked house, Along with treasures of wickedness And a short measure that is cursed?
Micah	Mic	33	6	11	"Can I justify wicked scales And a bag of deceptive weights?
Micah	Mic	33	6	12	"For the rich men of the city are full of violence, Her residents speak lies, And their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.
Micah	Mic	33	6	13	"So also I will make you sick, striking you down, Desolating you because of your sins.
Micah	Mic	33	6	14	"You will eat, but you will not be satisfied, And your vileness will be in your midst. You will try to remove for safekeeping, But you will not preserve anything, And what you do preserve I will give to the sword.
Micah	Mic	33	6	15	"You will sow but you will not reap. You will tread the olive but will not anoint yourself with oil; And the grapes, but you will not drink wine.
Micah	Mic	33	6	16	"The statutes of Omri And all the works of the house of Ahab are observed; And in their devices you walk. Therefore I will give you up for destruction And your inhabitants for derision, And you will bear the reproach of My people."
Micah	Mic	33	7	1	Woe is me! For I am Like the fruit pickers, like the grape gatherers. There is not a cluster of grapes to eat, Or a first-ripe fig which I crave.
Micah	Mic	33	7	2	The godly person has perished from the land, And there is no upright person among men. All of them lie in wait for bloodshed; Each of them hunts the other with a net.
Micah	Mic	33	7	3	Concerning evil, both hands do it well. The prince asks, also the judge, for a bribe, And a great man speaks the desire of his soul; So they weave it together.
Micah	Mic	33	7	4	The best of them is like a briar, The most upright like a thorn hedge. The day when you post your watchmen, Your punishment will come. Then their confusion will occur.
Micah	Mic	33	7	5	Do not trust in a neighbor; Do not have confidence in a friend. From her who lies in your bosom Guard your lips.
Micah	Mic	33	7	6	For son treats father contemptuously, Daughter rises up against her mother, Daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; A man's enemies are the men of his own household.
Micah	Mic	33	7	7	But as for me, I will watch expectantly for the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation. My God will hear me.
Micah	Mic	33	7	8	Do not rejoice over me, O my enemy. Though I fall I will rise; Though I dwell in darkness, the LORD is a light for me.
Micah	Mic	33	7	9	I will bear the indignation of the LORD Because I have sinned against Him, Until He pleads my case and executes justice for me. He will bring me out to the light, And I will see His righteousness.
Micah	Mic	33	7	10	Then my enemy will see, And shame will cover her who said to me, "Where is the LORD your God?" My eyes will look on her; At that time she will be trampled down Like mire of the streets.
Micah	Mic	33	7	11	It will be a day for building your walls. On that day will your boundary be extended.
Micah	Mic	33	7	12	It will be a day when they will come to you From Assyria and the cities of Egypt, From Egypt even to the Euphrates, Even from sea to sea and mountain to mountain.
Micah	Mic	33	7	13	And the earth will become desolate because of her inhabitants, On account of the fruit of their deeds.
Micah	Mic	33	7	14	Shepherd Your people with Your scepter, The flock of Your possession Which dwells by itself in the woodland, In the midst of a fruitful field. Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead As in the days of old.
Micah	Mic	33	7	15	"As in the days when you came out from the land of Egypt, I will show you miracles."
Micah	Mic	33	7	16	Nations will see and be ashamed Of all their might. They will put their hand on their mouth, Their ears will be deaf.
Micah	Mic	33	7	17	They will lick the dust like a serpent, Like reptiles of the earth. They will come trembling out of their fortresses; To the LORD our God they will come in dread And they will be afraid before You.
Micah	Mic	33	7	18	Who is a God like You, who pardons iniquity And passes over the rebellious act of the remnant of His possession? He does not retain His anger forever, Because He delights in unchanging love.
Micah	Mic	33	7	19	He will again have compassion on us; He will tread our iniquities under foot. Yes, You will cast all their sins Into the depths of the sea.
Micah	Mic	33	7	20	You will give truth to Jacob And unchanging love to Abraham, Which You swore to our forefathers From the days of old.
Nahum	Nahum	34	1	1	The oracle of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.
Nahum	Nahum	34	1	2	A jealous and avenging God is the LORD; The LORD is avenging and wrathful. The LORD takes vengeance on His adversaries, And He reserves wrath for His enemies.
Nahum	Nahum	34	1	3	The LORD is slow to anger and great in power, And the LORD will by no means leave the guilty unpunished. In whirlwind and storm is His way, And clouds are the dust beneath His feet.
Nahum	Nahum	34	1	4	He rebukes the sea and makes it dry; He dries up all the rivers. Bashan and Carmel wither; The blossoms of Lebanon wither.
Nahum	Nahum	34	1	5	Mountains quake because of Him And the hills dissolve; Indeed the earth is upheaved by His presence, The world and all the inhabitants in it.
Nahum	Nahum	34	1	6	Who can stand before His indignation? Who can endure the burning of His anger? His wrath is poured out like fire And the rocks are broken up by Him.
Nahum	Nahum	34	1	7	The LORD is good, A stronghold in the day of trouble, And He knows those who take refuge in Him.
Nahum	Nahum	34	1	8	But with an overflowing flood He will make a complete end of its site, And will pursue His enemies into darkness.
Nahum	Nahum	34	1	9	Whatever you devise against the LORD, He will make a complete end of it. Distress will not rise up twice.
Nahum	Nahum	34	1	10	Like tangled thorns, And like those who are drunken with their drink, They are consumed As stubble completely withered.
Nahum	Nahum	34	1	11	From you has gone forth One who plotted evil against the LORD, A wicked counselor.
Nahum	Nahum	34	1	12	Thus says the LORD, "Though they are at full strength and likewise many, Even so, they will be cut off and pass away. Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no longer.
Nahum	Nahum	34	1	13	"So now, I will break his yoke bar from upon you, And I will tear off your shackles."
Nahum	Nahum	34	1	14	The LORD has issued a command concerning you: "Your name will no longer be perpetuated. I will cut off idol and image From the house of your gods. I will prepare your grave, For you are contemptible."
Nahum	Nahum	34	1	15	Behold, on the mountains the feet of him who brings good news, Who announces peace! Celebrate your feasts, O Judah; Pay your vows. For never again will the wicked one pass through you; He is cut off completely.
Nahum	Nahum	34	2	1	The one who scatters has come up against you. Man the fortress, watch the road; Strengthen your back, summon all your strength.
Nahum	Nahum	34	2	2	For the LORD will restore the splendor of Jacob Like the splendor of Israel, Even though devastators have devastated them And destroyed their vine branches.
Nahum	Nahum	34	2	3	The shields of his mighty men are colored red, The warriors are dressed in scarlet, The chariots are enveloped in flashing steel When he is prepared to march, And the cypress spears are brandished.
Nahum	Nahum	34	2	4	The chariots race madly in the streets, They rush wildly in the squares, Their appearance is like torches, They dash to and fro like lightning flashes.
Nahum	Nahum	34	2	5	He remembers his nobles; They stumble in their march, They hurry to her wall, And the mantelet is set up.
Nahum	Nahum	34	2	6	The gates of the rivers are opened And the palace is dissolved.
Nahum	Nahum	34	2	7	It is fixed: She is stripped, she is carried away, And her handmaids are moaning like the sound of doves, Beating on their breasts.
Nahum	Nahum	34	2	8	Though Nineveh was like a pool of water throughout her days, Now they are fleeing; "Stop, stop," But no one turns back.
Nahum	Nahum	34	2	9	Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold! For there is no limit to the treasure-- Wealth from every kind of desirable object.
Nahum	Nahum	34	2	10	She is emptied! Yes, she is desolate and waste! Hearts are melting and knees knocking! Also anguish is in the whole body And all their faces are grown pale!
Nahum	Nahum	34	2	11	Where is the den of the lions And the feeding place of the young lions, Where the lion, lioness and lion's cub prowled, With nothing to disturb them?
Nahum	Nahum	34	2	12	The lion tore enough for his cubs, Killed enough for his lionesses, And filled his lairs with prey And his dens with torn flesh.
Nahum	Nahum	34	2	13	"Behold, I am against you," declares the LORD of hosts. "I will burn up her chariots in smoke, a sword will devour your young lions; I will cut off your prey from the land, and no longer will the voice of your messengers be heard."
Nahum	Nahum	34	3	1	Woe to the bloody city, completely full of lies and pillage; Her prey never departs.
Nahum	Nahum	34	3	2	The noise of the whip, The noise of the rattling of the wheel, Galloping horses And bounding chariots!
Nahum	Nahum	34	3	3	Horsemen charging, Swords flashing, spears gleaming, Many slain, a mass of corpses, And countless dead bodies-- They stumble over the dead bodies!
Nahum	Nahum	34	3	4	All because of the many harlotries of the harlot, The charming one, the mistress of sorceries, Who sells nations by her harlotries And families by her sorceries.
Nahum	Nahum	34	3	5	"Behold, I am against you," declares the LORD of hosts; "And I will lift up your skirts over your face, And show to the nations your nakedness And to the kingdoms your disgrace.
Nahum	Nahum	34	3	6	"I will throw filth on you And make you vile, And set you up as a spectacle.
Nahum	Nahum	34	3	7	"And it will come about that all who see you Will shrink from you and say, 'Nineveh is devastated! Who will grieve for her?' Where will I seek comforters for you?"
Nahum	Nahum	34	3	8	Are you better than No-amon, Which was situated by the waters of the Nile, With water surrounding her, Whose rampart was the sea, Whose wall consisted of the sea?
Nahum	Nahum	34	3	9	Ethiopia was her might, And Egypt too, without limits. Put and Lubim were among her helpers.
Nahum	Nahum	34	3	10	Yet she became an exile, She went into captivity; Also her small children were dashed to pieces At the head of every street; They cast lots for her honorable men, And all her great men were bound with fetters.
Nahum	Nahum	34	3	11	You too will become drunk, You will be hidden. You too will search for a refuge from the enemy.
Nahum	Nahum	34	3	12	All your fortifications are fig trees with ripe fruit-- When shaken, they fall into the eater's mouth.
Nahum	Nahum	34	3	13	Behold, your people are women in your midst! The gates of your land are opened wide to your enemies; Fire consumes your gate bars.
Nahum	Nahum	34	3	14	Draw for yourself water for the siege! Strengthen your fortifications! Go into the clay and tread the mortar! Take hold of the brick mold!
Nahum	Nahum	34	3	15	There fire will consume you, The sword will cut you down; It will consume you as the locust does. Multiply yourself like the creeping locust, Multiply yourself like the swarming locust.
Nahum	Nahum	34	3	16	You have increased your traders more than the stars of heaven-- The creeping locust strips and flies away.
Nahum	Nahum	34	3	17	Your guardsmen are like the swarming locust. Your marshals are like hordes of grasshoppers Settling in the stone walls on a cold day. The sun rises and they flee, And the place where they are is not known.
Nahum	Nahum	34	3	18	Your shepherds are sleeping, O king of Assyria; Your nobles are lying down. Your people are scattered on the mountains And there is no one to regather them.
Nahum	Nahum	34	3	19	There is no relief for your breakdown, Your wound is incurable. All who hear about you Will clap their hands over you, For on whom has not your evil passed continually?
Habakkuk	Hab	35	1	1	The oracle which Habakkuk the prophet saw.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	1	2	How long, O LORD, will I call for help, And You will not hear? I cry out to You, "Violence!" Yet You do not save.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	1	3	Why do You make me see iniquity, And cause me to look on wickedness? Yes, destruction and violence are before me; Strife exists and contention arises.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	1	4	Therefore the law is ignored And justice is never upheld. For the wicked surround the righteous; Therefore justice comes out perverted.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	1	5	"Look among the nations! Observe! Be astonished! Wonder! Because I am doing something in your days-- You would not believe if you were told.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	1	6	"For behold, I am raising up the Chaldeans, That fierce and impetuous people Who march throughout the earth To seize dwelling places which are not theirs.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	1	7	"They are dreaded and feared; Their justice and authority originate with themselves.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	1	8	"Their horses are swifter than leopards And keener than wolves in the evening. Their horsemen come galloping, Their horsemen come from afar; They fly like an eagle swooping down to devour.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	1	9	"All of them come for violence. Their horde of faces moves forward. They collect captives like sand.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	1	10	"They mock at kings And rulers are a laughing matter to them. They laugh at every fortress And heap up rubble to capture it.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	1	11	"Then they will sweep through like the wind and pass on. But they will be held guilty, They whose strength is their god."
Habakkuk	Hab	35	1	12	Are You not from everlasting, O LORD, my God, my Holy One? We will not die. You, O LORD, have appointed them to judge; And You, O Rock, have established them to correct.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	1	13	Your eyes are too pure to approve evil, And You can not look on wickedness with favor. Why do You look with favor On those who deal treacherously? Why are You silent when the wicked swallow up Those more righteous than they?
Habakkuk	Hab	35	1	14	Why have You made men like the fish of the sea, Like creeping things without a ruler over them?
Habakkuk	Hab	35	1	15	The Chaldeans bring all of them up with a hook, Drag them away with their net, And gather them together in their fishing net. Therefore they rejoice and are glad.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	1	16	Therefore they offer a sacrifice to their net And burn incense to their fishing net; Because through these things their catch is large, And their food is plentiful.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	1	17	Will they therefore empty their net And continually slay nations without sparing?
Habakkuk	Hab	35	2	1	I will stand on my guard post And station myself on the rampart; And I will keep watch to see what He will speak to me, And how I may reply when I am reproved.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	2	2	Then the LORD answered me and said, "Record the vision And inscribe it on tablets, That the one who reads it may run.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	2	3	"For the vision is yet for the appointed time; It hastens toward the goal and it will not fail. Though it tarries, wait for it; For it will certainly come, it will not delay.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	2	4	"Behold, as for the proud one, His soul is not right within him; But the righteous will live by his faith.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	2	5	"Furthermore, wine betrays the haughty man, So that he does not stay at home. He enlarges his appetite like Sheol, And he is like death, never satisfied. He also gathers to himself all nations And collects to himself all peoples.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	2	6	"Will not all of these take up a taunt-song against him, Even mockery and insinuations against him And say, 'Woe to him who increases what is not his-- For how long-- And makes himself rich with loans?'
Habakkuk	Hab	35	2	7	"Will not your creditors rise up suddenly, And those who collect from you awaken? Indeed, you will become plunder for them.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	2	8	"Because you have looted many nations, All the remainder of the peoples will loot you-- Because of human bloodshed and violence done to the land, To the town and all its inhabitants.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	2	9	"Woe to him who gets evil gain for his house To put his nest on high, To be delivered from the hand of calamity!
Habakkuk	Hab	35	2	10	"You have devised a shameful thing for your house By cutting off many peoples; So you are sinning against yourself.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	2	11	"Surely the stone will cry out from the wall, And the rafter will answer it from the framework.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	2	12	"Woe to him who builds a city with bloodshed And founds a town with violence!
Habakkuk	Hab	35	2	13	"Is it not indeed from the LORD of hosts That peoples toil for fire, And nations grow weary for nothing?
Habakkuk	Hab	35	2	14	"For the earth will be filled With the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, As the waters cover the sea.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	2	15	"Woe to you who make your neighbors drink, Who mix in your venom even to make them drunk So as to look on their nakedness!
Habakkuk	Hab	35	2	16	"You will be filled with disgrace rather than honor. Now you yourself drink and expose your own nakedness. The cup in the LORD'S right hand will come around to you, And utter disgrace will come upon your glory.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	2	17	"For the violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you, And the devastation of its beasts by which you terrified them, Because of human bloodshed and violence done to the land, To the town and all its inhabitants.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	2	18	"What profit is the idol when its maker has carved it, Or an image, a teacher of falsehood? For its maker trusts in his own handiwork When he fashions speechless idols.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	2	19	"Woe to him who says to a piece of wood, 'Awake!' To a mute stone, 'Arise!' And that is your teacher? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, And there is no breath at all inside it.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	2	20	"But the LORD is in His holy temple. Let all the earth be silent before Him."
Habakkuk	Hab	35	3	1	A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, according to Shigionoth.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	3	2	LORD, I have heard the report about You and I fear. O LORD, revive Your work in the midst of the years, In the midst of the years make it known; In wrath remember mercy.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	3	3	God comes from Teman, And the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah. His splendor covers the heavens, And the earth is full of His praise.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	3	4	His radiance is like the sunlight; He has rays flashing from His hand, And there is the hiding of His power.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	3	5	Before Him goes pestilence, And plague comes after Him.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	3	6	He stood and surveyed the earth; He looked and startled the nations. Yes, the perpetual mountains were shattered, The ancient hills collapsed. His ways are everlasting.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	3	7	I saw the tents of Cushan under distress, The tent curtains of the land of Midian were trembling.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	3	8	Did the LORD rage against the rivers, Or was Your anger against the rivers, Or was Your wrath against the sea, That You rode on Your horses, On Your chariots of salvation?
Habakkuk	Hab	35	3	9	Your bow was made bare, The rods of chastisement were sworn. Selah. You cleaved the earth with rivers.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	3	10	The mountains saw You and quaked; The downpour of waters swept by. The deep uttered forth its voice, It lifted high its hands.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	3	11	Sun and moon stood in their places; They went away at the light of Your arrows, At the radiance of Your gleaming spear.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	3	12	In indignation You marched through the earth; In anger You trampled the nations.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	3	13	You went forth for the salvation of Your people, For the salvation of Your anointed. You struck the head of the house of the evil To lay him open from thigh to neck. Selah.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	3	14	You pierced with his own spears The head of his throngs. They stormed in to scatter us; Their exultation was like those Who devour the oppressed in secret.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	3	15	You trampled on the sea with Your horses, On the surge of many waters.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	3	16	I heard and my inward parts trembled, At the sound my lips quivered. Decay enters my bones, And in my place I tremble. Because I must wait quietly for the day of distress, For the people to arise who will invade us.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	3	17	Though the fig tree should not blossom And there be no fruit on the vines, Though the yield of the olive should fail And the fields produce no food, Though the flock should be cut off from the fold And there be no cattle in the stalls,
Habakkuk	Hab	35	3	18	Yet I will exult in the LORD, I will rejoice in the God of my salvation.
Habakkuk	Hab	35	3	19	The Lord GOD is my strength, And He has made my feet like hinds' feet, And makes me walk on my high places. For the choir director, on my stringed instruments.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	1	1	The word of the LORD which came to Zephaniah son of Cushi, son of Gedaliah, son of Amariah, son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah:
Zephaniah	Zep	36	1	2	"I will completely remove all things From the face of the earth," declares the LORD.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	1	3	"I will remove man and beast; I will remove the birds of the sky And the fish of the sea, And the ruins along with the wicked; And I will cut off man from the face of the earth," declares the LORD.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	1	4	"So I will stretch out My hand against Judah And against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, And the names of the idolatrous priests along with the priests.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	1	5	"And those who bow down on the housetops to the host of heaven, And those who bow down and swear to the LORD and yet swear by Milcom,
Zephaniah	Zep	36	1	6	And those who have turned back from following the LORD, And those who have not sought the LORD or inquired of Him."
Zephaniah	Zep	36	1	7	Be silent before the Lord GOD! For the day of the LORD is near, For the LORD has prepared a sacrifice, He has consecrated His guests.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	1	8	"Then it will come about on the day of the LORD'S sacrifice That I will punish the princes, the king's sons And all who clothe themselves with foreign garments.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	1	9	"And I will punish on that day all who leap on the temple threshold, Who fill the house of their lord with violence and deceit.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	1	10	"On that day," declares the LORD, "There will be the sound of a cry from the Fish Gate, A wail from the Second Quarter, And a loud crash from the hills.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	1	11	"Wail, O inhabitants of the Mortar, For all the people of Canaan will be silenced; All who weigh out silver will be cut off.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	1	12	"It will come about at that time That I will search Jerusalem with lamps, And I will punish the men Who are stagnant in spirit, Who say in their hearts, 'The LORD will not do good or evil!'
Zephaniah	Zep	36	1	13	"Moreover, their wealth will become plunder And their houses desolate; Yes, they will build houses but not inhabit them, And plant vineyards but not drink their wine."
Zephaniah	Zep	36	1	14	Near is the great day of the LORD, Near and coming very quickly; Listen, the day of the LORD! In it the warrior cries out bitterly.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	1	15	A day of wrath is that day, A day of trouble and distress, A day of destruction and desolation, A day of darkness and gloom, A day of clouds and thick darkness,
Zephaniah	Zep	36	1	16	A day of trumpet and battle cry Against the fortified cities And the high corner towers.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	1	17	I will bring distress on men So that they will walk like the blind, Because they have sinned against the LORD; And their blood will be poured out like dust And their flesh like dung.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	1	18	Neither their silver nor their gold Will be able to deliver them On the day of the LORD'S wrath; And all the earth will be devoured In the fire of His jealousy, For He will make a complete end, Indeed a terrifying one, Of all the inhabitants of the earth.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	2	1	Gather yourselves together, yes, gather, O nation without shame,
Zephaniah	Zep	36	2	2	Before the decree takes effect-- The day passes like the chaff-- Before the burning anger of the LORD comes upon you, Before the day of the LORD'S anger comes upon you.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	2	3	Seek the LORD, All you humble of the earth Who have carried out His ordinances; Seek righteousness, seek humility. Perhaps you will be hidden In the day of the LORD'S anger.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	2	4	For Gaza will be abandoned And Ashkelon a desolation; Ashdod will be driven out at noon And Ekron will be uprooted.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	2	5	Woe to the inhabitants of the seacoast, The nation of the Cherethites! The word of the LORD is against you, O Canaan, land of the Philistines; And I will destroy you So that there will be no inhabitant.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	2	6	So the seacoast will be pastures, With caves for shepherds and folds for flocks.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	2	7	And the coast will be For the remnant of the house of Judah, They will pasture on it. In the houses of Ashkelon they will lie down at evening; For the LORD their God will care for them And restore their fortune.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	2	8	"I have heard the taunting of Moab And the revilings of the sons of Ammon, With which they have taunted My people And become arrogant against their territory.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	2	9	"Therefore, as I live," declares the LORD of hosts, The God of Israel, "Surely Moab will be like Sodom And the sons of Ammon like Gomorrah-- A place possessed by nettles and salt pits, And a perpetual desolation. The remnant of My people will plunder them And the remainder of My nation will inherit them."
Zephaniah	Zep	36	2	10	This they will have in return for their pride, because they have taunted and become arrogant against the people of the LORD of hosts.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	2	11	The LORD will be terrifying to them, for He will starve all the gods of the earth; and all the coastlands of the nations will bow down to Him, everyone from his own place.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	2	12	"You also, O Ethiopians, will be slain by My sword."
Zephaniah	Zep	36	2	13	And He will stretch out His hand against the north And destroy Assyria, And He will make Nineveh a desolation, Parched like the wilderness.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	2	14	Flocks will lie down in her midst, All beasts which range in herds; Both the pelican and the hedgehog Will lodge in the tops of her pillars; Birds will sing in the window, Desolation will be on the threshold; For He has laid bare the cedar work.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	2	15	This is the exultant city Which dwells securely, Who says in her heart, "I am, and there is no one besides me." How she has become a desolation, A resting place for beasts! Everyone who passes by her will hiss And wave his hand in contempt.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	3	1	Woe to her who is rebellious and defiled, The tyrannical city!
Zephaniah	Zep	36	3	2	She heeded no voice, She accepted no instruction. She did not trust in the LORD, She did not draw near to her God.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	3	3	Her princes within her are roaring lions, Her judges are wolves at evening; They leave nothing for the morning.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	3	4	Her prophets are reckless, treacherous men; Her priests have profaned the sanctuary. They have done violence to the law.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	3	5	The LORD is righteous within her; He will do no injustice. Every morning He brings His justice to light; He does not fail. But the unjust knows no shame.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	3	6	"I have cut off nations; Their corner towers are in ruins. I have made their streets desolate, With no one passing by; Their cities are laid waste, Without a man, without an inhabitant.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	3	7	"I said, 'Surely you will revere Me, Accept instruction.' So her dwelling will not be cut off According to all that I have appointed concerning her. But they were eager to corrupt all their deeds.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	3	8	"Therefore wait for Me," declares the LORD, "For the day when I rise up as a witness. Indeed, My decision is to gather nations, To assemble kingdoms, To pour out on them My indignation, All My burning anger; For all the earth will be devoured By the fire of My zeal.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	3	9	"For then I will give to the peoples purified lips, That all of them may call on the name of the LORD, To serve Him shoulder to shoulder.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	3	10	"From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia My worshipers, My dispersed ones, Will bring My offerings.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	3	11	"In that day you will feel no shame Because of all your deeds By which you have rebelled against Me; For then I will remove from your midst Your proud, exulting ones, And you will never again be haughty On My holy mountain.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	3	12	"But I will leave among you A humble and lowly people, And they will take refuge in the name of the LORD.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	3	13	"The remnant of Israel will do no wrong And tell no lies, Nor will a deceitful tongue Be found in their mouths; For they will feed and lie down With no one to make them tremble."
Zephaniah	Zep	36	3	14	Shout for joy, O daughter of Zion! Shout in triumph, O Israel! Rejoice and exult with all your heart, O daughter of Jerusalem!
Zephaniah	Zep	36	3	15	The LORD has taken away His judgments against you, He has cleared away your enemies. The King of Israel, the LORD, is in your midst; You will fear disaster no more.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	3	16	In that day it will be said to Jerusalem: "Do not be afraid, O Zion; Do not let your hands fall limp.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	3	17	"The LORD your God is in your midst, A victorious warrior. He will exult over you with joy, He will be quiet in His love, He will rejoice over you with shouts of joy.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	3	18	"I will gather those who grieve about the appointed feasts-- They came from you, O Zion; The reproach of exile is a burden on them.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	3	19	"Behold, I am going to deal at that time With all your oppressors, I will save the lame And gather the outcast, And I will turn their shame into praise and renown In all the earth.
Zephaniah	Zep	36	3	20	"At that time I will bring you in, Even at the time when I gather you together; Indeed, I will give you renown and praise Among all the peoples of the earth, When I restore your fortunes before your eyes," Says the LORD.
Haggai	Hag	37	1	1	In the second year of Darius the king, on the first day of the sixth month, the word of the LORD came by the prophet Haggai to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, saying,
Haggai	Hag	37	1	2	"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'This people says, "The time has not come, even the time for the house of the LORD to be rebuilt."'"
Haggai	Hag	37	1	3	Then the word of the LORD came by Haggai the prophet, saying,
Haggai	Hag	37	1	4	"Is it time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses while this house lies desolate?"
Haggai	Hag	37	1	5	Now therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts, "Consider your ways!
Haggai	Hag	37	1	6	"You have sown much, but harvest little; you eat, but there is not enough to be satisfied; you drink, but there is not enough to become drunk; you put on clothing, but no one is warm enough; and he who earns, earns wages to put into a purse with holes."
Haggai	Hag	37	1	7	Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Consider your ways!
Haggai	Hag	37	1	8	"Go up to the mountains, bring wood and rebuild the temple, that I may be pleased with it and be glorified," says the LORD.
Haggai	Hag	37	1	9	"You look for much, but behold, it comes to little; when you bring it home, I blow it away. Why?" declares the LORD of hosts, "Because of My house which lies desolate, while each of you runs to his own house.
Haggai	Hag	37	1	10	"Therefore, because of you the sky has withheld its dew and the earth has withheld its produce.
Haggai	Hag	37	1	11	"I called for a drought on the land, on the mountains, on the grain, on the new wine, on the oil, on what the ground produces, on men, on cattle, and on all the labor of your hands."
Haggai	Hag	37	1	12	Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him. And the people showed reverence for the LORD.
Haggai	Hag	37	1	13	Then Haggai, the messenger of the LORD, spoke by the commission of the LORD to the people saying, " 'I am with you,' declares the LORD."
Haggai	Hag	37	1	14	So the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and worked on the house of the LORD of hosts, their God,
Haggai	Hag	37	1	15	on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month in the second year of Darius the king.
Haggai	Hag	37	2	1	On the twenty-first of the seventh month, the word of the LORD came by Haggai the prophet saying,
Haggai	Hag	37	2	2	"Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people saying,
Haggai	Hag	37	2	3	'Who is left among you who saw this temple in its former glory? And how do you see it now? Does it not seem to you like nothing in comparison?
Haggai	Hag	37	2	4	'But now take courage, Zerubbabel,' declares the LORD, 'take courage also, Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and all you people of the land take courage,' declares the LORD, 'and work; for I am with you,' declares the LORD of hosts.
Haggai	Hag	37	2	5	'As for the promise which I made you when you came out of Egypt, My Spirit is abiding in your midst; do not fear!'
Haggai	Hag	37	2	6	"For thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Once more in a little while, I am going to shake the heavens and the earth, the sea also and the dry land.
Haggai	Hag	37	2	7	'I will shake all the nations; and they will come with the wealth of all nations, and I will fill this house with glory,' says the LORD of hosts.
Haggai	Hag	37	2	8	'The silver is Mine and the gold is Mine,' declares the LORD of hosts.
Haggai	Hag	37	2	9	'The latter glory of this house will be greater than the former,' says the LORD of hosts, 'and in this place I will give peace,' declares the LORD of hosts."
Haggai	Hag	37	2	10	On the twenty-fourth of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Haggai the prophet, saying,
Haggai	Hag	37	2	11	"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Ask now the priests for a ruling:
Haggai	Hag	37	2	12	'If a man carries holy meat in the fold of his garment, and touches bread with this fold, or cooked food, wine, oil, or any other food, will it become holy?'" And the priests answered, "No."
Haggai	Hag	37	2	13	Then Haggai said, "If one who is unclean from a corpse touches any of these, will the latter become unclean?" And the priests answered, "It will become unclean."
Haggai	Hag	37	2	14	Then Haggai said, " 'So is this people. And so is this nation before Me,' declares the LORD, 'and so is every work of their hands; and what they offer there is unclean.
Haggai	Hag	37	2	15	'But now, do consider from this day onward: before one stone was placed on another in the temple of the LORD,
Haggai	Hag	37	2	16	from that time when one came to a grain heap of twenty measures, there would be only ten; and when one came to the wine vat to draw fifty measures, there would be only twenty.
Haggai	Hag	37	2	17	'I smote you and every work of your hands with blasting wind, mildew and hail; yet you did not come back to Me,' declares the LORD.
Haggai	Hag	37	2	18	'Do consider from this day onward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month; from the day when the temple of the LORD was founded, consider:
Haggai	Hag	37	2	19	'Is the seed still in the barn? Even including the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate and the olive tree, it has not borne fruit. Yet from this day on I will bless you.'"
Haggai	Hag	37	2	20	Then the word of the LORD came a second time to Haggai on the twenty-fourth day of the month, saying,
Haggai	Hag	37	2	21	"Speak to Zerubbabel governor of Judah, saying, 'I am going to shake the heavens and the earth.
Haggai	Hag	37	2	22	'I will overthrow the thrones of kingdoms and destroy the power of the kingdoms of the nations; and I will overthrow the chariots and their riders, and the horses and their riders will go down, everyone by the sword of another.'
Haggai	Hag	37	2	23	'On that day,' declares the LORD of hosts, 'I will take you, Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, My servant,' declares the LORD, 'and I will make you like a signet ring, for I have chosen you,'" declares the LORD of hosts.
Zechariah	Zec	38	1	1	In the eighth month of the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo saying,
Zechariah	Zec	38	1	2	"The LORD was very angry with your fathers.
Zechariah	Zec	38	1	3	"Therefore say to them, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Return to Me," declares the LORD of hosts, "that I may return to you," says the LORD of hosts.
Zechariah	Zec	38	1	4	"Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets proclaimed, saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Return now from your evil ways and from your evil deeds."' But they did not listen or give heed to Me," declares the LORD.
Zechariah	Zec	38	1	5	"Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever?
Zechariah	Zec	38	1	6	"But did not My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets, overtake your fathers? Then they repented and said, 'As the LORD of hosts purposed to do to us in accordance with our ways and our deeds, so He has dealt with us.'"'"
Zechariah	Zec	38	1	7	On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, as follows:
Zechariah	Zec	38	1	8	I saw at night, and behold, a man was riding on a red horse, and he was standing among the myrtle trees which were in the ravine, with red, sorrel and white horses behind him.
Zechariah	Zec	38	1	9	Then I said, "My lord, what are these?" And the angel who was speaking with me said to me, "I will show you what these are."
Zechariah	Zec	38	1	10	And the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered and said, "These are those whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth."
Zechariah	Zec	38	1	11	So they answered the angel of the LORD who was standing among the myrtle trees and said, "We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth is peaceful and quiet."
Zechariah	Zec	38	1	12	Then the angel of the LORD said, "O LORD of hosts, how long will You have no compassion for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with which You have been indignant these seventy years?"
Zechariah	Zec	38	1	13	The LORD answered the angel who was speaking with me with gracious words, comforting words.
Zechariah	Zec	38	1	14	So the angel who was speaking with me said to me, "Proclaim, saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "I am exceedingly jealous for Jerusalem and Zion.
Zechariah	Zec	38	1	15	"But I am very angry with the nations who are at ease; for while I was only a little angry, they furthered the disaster."
Zechariah	Zec	38	1	16	'Therefore thus says the LORD, "I will return to Jerusalem with compassion; My house will be built in it," declares the LORD of hosts, "and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem."'
Zechariah	Zec	38	1	17	"Again, proclaim, saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "My cities will again overflow with prosperity, and the LORD will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem."'"
Zechariah	Zec	38	1	18	Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there were four horns.
Zechariah	Zec	38	1	19	So I said to the angel who was speaking with me, "What are these?" And he answered me, "These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem."
Zechariah	Zec	38	1	20	Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen.
Zechariah	Zec	38	1	21	I said, "What are these coming to do?" And he said, "These are the horns which have scattered Judah so that no man lifts up his head; but these craftsmen have come to terrify them, to throw down the horns of the nations who have lifted up their horns against the land of Judah in order to scatter it."
Zechariah	Zec	38	2	1	Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there was a man with a measuring line in his hand.
Zechariah	Zec	38	2	2	So I said, "Where are you going?" And he said to me, "To measure Jerusalem, to see how wide it is and how long it is."
Zechariah	Zec	38	2	3	And behold, the angel who was speaking with me was going out, and another angel was coming out to meet him,
Zechariah	Zec	38	2	4	and said to him, "Run, speak to that young man, saying, 'Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls because of the multitude of men and cattle within it.
Zechariah	Zec	38	2	5	'For I,' declares the LORD, 'will be a wall of fire around her, and I will be the glory in her midst.'"
Zechariah	Zec	38	2	6	"Ho there! Flee from the land of the north," declares the LORD, "for I have dispersed you as the four winds of the heavens," declares the LORD.
Zechariah	Zec	38	2	7	"Ho, Zion! Escape, you who are living with the daughter of Babylon."
Zechariah	Zec	38	2	8	For thus says the LORD of hosts, "After glory He has sent me against the nations which plunder you, for he who touches you, touches the apple of His eye.
Zechariah	Zec	38	2	9	"For behold, I will wave My hand over them so that they will be plunder for their slaves. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me.
Zechariah	Zec	38	2	10	"Sing for joy and be glad, O daughter of Zion; for behold I am coming and I will dwell in your midst," declares the LORD.
Zechariah	Zec	38	2	11	"Many nations will join themselves to the LORD in that day and will become My people. Then I will dwell in your midst, and you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you.
Zechariah	Zec	38	2	12	"The LORD will possess Judah as His portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem.
Zechariah	Zec	38	2	13	"Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for He is aroused from His holy habitation."
Zechariah	Zec	38	3	1	Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him.
Zechariah	Zec	38	3	2	The LORD said to Satan, "The LORD rebuke you, Satan! Indeed, the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?"
Zechariah	Zec	38	3	3	Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and standing before the angel.
Zechariah	Zec	38	3	4	He spoke and said to those who were standing before him, saying, "Remove the filthy garments from him." Again he said to him, "See, I have taken your iniquity away from you and will clothe you with festal robes."
Zechariah	Zec	38	3	5	Then I said, "Let them put a clean turban on his head." So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments, while the angel of the LORD was standing by.
Zechariah	Zec	38	3	6	And the angel of the LORD admonished Joshua, saying,
Zechariah	Zec	38	3	7	"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'If you will walk in My ways and if you will perform My service, then you will also govern My house and also have charge of My courts, and I will grant you free access among these who are standing here.
Zechariah	Zec	38	3	8	'Now listen, Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who are sitting in front of you--indeed they are men who are a symbol, for behold, I am going to bring in My servant the Branch.
Zechariah	Zec	38	3	9	'For behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes. Behold, I will engrave an inscription on it,' declares the LORD of hosts, 'and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.
Zechariah	Zec	38	3	10	'In that day,' declares the LORD of hosts, 'every one of you will invite his neighbor to sit under his vine and under his fig tree.'"
Zechariah	Zec	38	4	1	Then the angel who was speaking with me returned and roused me, as a man who is awakened from his sleep.
Zechariah	Zec	38	4	2	He said to me, "What do you see?" And I said, "I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold with its bowl on the top of it, and its seven lamps on it with seven spouts belonging to each of the lamps which are on the top of it;
Zechariah	Zec	38	4	3	also two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left side."
Zechariah	Zec	38	4	4	Then I said to the angel who was speaking with me saying, "What are these, my lord?"
Zechariah	Zec	38	4	5	So the angel who was speaking with me answered and said to me, "Do you not know what these are?" And I said, "No, my lord."
Zechariah	Zec	38	4	6	Then he said to me, "This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel saying, 'Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,' says the LORD of hosts.
Zechariah	Zec	38	4	7	'What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain; and he will bring forth the top stone with shouts of "Grace, grace to it!"'"
Zechariah	Zec	38	4	8	Also the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
Zechariah	Zec	38	4	9	"The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will finish it. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.
Zechariah	Zec	38	4	10	"For who has despised the day of small things? But these seven will be glad when they see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel--these are the eyes of the LORD which range to and fro throughout the earth."
Zechariah	Zec	38	4	11	Then I said to him, "What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?"
Zechariah	Zec	38	4	12	And I answered the second time and said to him, "What are the two olive branches which are beside the two golden pipes, which empty the golden oil from themselves?"
Zechariah	Zec	38	4	13	So he answered me, saying, "Do you not know what these are?" And I said, "No, my lord."
Zechariah	Zec	38	4	14	Then he said, "These are the two anointed ones who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth."
Zechariah	Zec	38	5	1	Then I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, there was a flying scroll.
Zechariah	Zec	38	5	2	And he said to me, "What do you see?" And I answered, "I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits and its width ten cubits."
Zechariah	Zec	38	5	3	Then he said to me, "This is the curse that is going forth over the face of the whole land; surely everyone who steals will be purged away according to the writing on one side, and everyone who swears will be purged away according to the writing on the other side.
Zechariah	Zec	38	5	4	"I will make it go forth," declares the LORD of hosts, "and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who swears falsely by My name; and it will spend the night within that house and consume it with its timber and stones."
Zechariah	Zec	38	5	5	Then the angel who was speaking with me went out and said to me, "Lift up now your eyes and see what this is going forth."
Zechariah	Zec	38	5	6	I said, "What is it?" And he said, "This is the ephah going forth." Again he said, "This is their appearance in all the land
Zechariah	Zec	38	5	7	(and behold, a lead cover was lifted up); and this is a woman sitting inside the ephah."
Zechariah	Zec	38	5	8	Then he said, "This is Wickedness!" And he threw her down into the middle of the ephah and cast the lead weight on its opening.
Zechariah	Zec	38	5	9	Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and there two women were coming out with the wind in their wings; and they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens.
Zechariah	Zec	38	5	10	I said to the angel who was speaking with me, "Where are they taking the ephah?"
Zechariah	Zec	38	5	11	Then he said to me, "To build a temple for her in the land of Shinar; and when it is prepared, she will be set there on her own pedestal."
Zechariah	Zec	38	6	1	Now I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, four chariots were coming forth from between the two mountains; and the mountains were bronze mountains.
Zechariah	Zec	38	6	2	With the first chariot were red horses, with the second chariot black horses,
Zechariah	Zec	38	6	3	with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth chariot strong dappled horses.
Zechariah	Zec	38	6	4	Then I spoke and said to the angel who was speaking with me, "What are these, my lord?"
Zechariah	Zec	38	6	5	The angel replied to me, "These are the four spirits of heaven, going forth after standing before the Lord of all the earth,
Zechariah	Zec	38	6	6	with one of which the black horses are going forth to the north country; and the white ones go forth after them, while the dappled ones go forth to the south country.
Zechariah	Zec	38	6	7	"When the strong ones went out, they were eager to go to patrol the earth." And He said, "Go, patrol the earth." So they patrolled the earth.
Zechariah	Zec	38	6	8	Then He cried out to me and spoke to me saying, "See, those who are going to the land of the north have appeased My wrath in the land of the north."
Zechariah	Zec	38	6	9	The word of the LORD also came to me, saying,
Zechariah	Zec	38	6	10	"Take an offering from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah; and you go the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have arrived from Babylon.
Zechariah	Zec	38	6	11	"Take silver and gold, make an ornate crown and set it on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest.
Zechariah	Zec	38	6	12	"Then say to him, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Behold, a man whose name is Branch, for He will branch out from where He is; and He will build the temple of the LORD.
Zechariah	Zec	38	6	13	"Yes, it is He who will build the temple of the LORD, and He who will bear the honor and sit and rule on His throne. Thus, He will be a priest on His throne, and the counsel of peace will be between the two offices."'
Zechariah	Zec	38	6	14	"Now the crown will become a reminder in the temple of the LORD to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen the son of Zephaniah.
Zechariah	Zec	38	6	15	"Those who are far off will come and build the temple of the LORD." Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. And it will take place if you completely obey the LORD your God.
Zechariah	Zec	38	7	1	In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chislev.
Zechariah	Zec	38	7	2	Now the town of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech and their men to seek the favor of the LORD,
Zechariah	Zec	38	7	3	speaking to the priests who belong to the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, "Shall I weep in the fifth month and abstain, as I have done these many years?"
Zechariah	Zec	38	7	4	Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,
Zechariah	Zec	38	7	5	"Say to all the people of the land and to the priests, 'When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months these seventy years, was it actually for Me that you fasted?
Zechariah	Zec	38	7	6	'When you eat and drink, do you not eat for yourselves and do you not drink for yourselves?
Zechariah	Zec	38	7	7	'Are not these the words which the LORD proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous along with its cities around it, and the Negev and the foothills were inhabited?'"
Zechariah	Zec	38	7	8	Then the word of the LORD came to Zechariah saying,
Zechariah	Zec	38	7	9	"Thus has the LORD of hosts said, 'Dispense true justice and practice kindness and compassion each to his brother;
Zechariah	Zec	38	7	10	and do not oppress the widow or the orphan, the stranger or the poor; and do not devise evil in your hearts against one another.'
Zechariah	Zec	38	7	11	"But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears from hearing.
Zechariah	Zec	38	7	12	"They made their hearts like flint so that they could not hear the law and the words which the LORD of hosts had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets; therefore great wrath came from the LORD of hosts.
Zechariah	Zec	38	7	13	"And just as He called and they would not listen, so they called and I would not listen," says the LORD of hosts;
Zechariah	Zec	38	7	14	"but I scattered them with a storm wind among all the nations whom they have not known. Thus the land is desolated behind them so that no one went back and forth, for they made the pleasant land desolate."
Zechariah	Zec	38	8	1	Then the word of the LORD of hosts came, saying,
Zechariah	Zec	38	8	2	"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'I am exceedingly jealous for Zion, yes, with great wrath I am jealous for her.'
Zechariah	Zec	38	8	3	"Thus says the LORD, 'I will return to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth, and the mountain of the LORD of hosts will be called the Holy Mountain.'
Zechariah	Zec	38	8	4	"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Old men and old women will again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each man with his staff in his hand because of age.
Zechariah	Zec	38	8	5	'And the streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing in its streets.'
Zechariah	Zec	38	8	6	"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'If it is too difficult in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, will it also be too difficult in My sight?' declares the LORD of hosts.
Zechariah	Zec	38	8	7	"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Behold, I am going to save My people from the land of the east and from the land of the west;
Zechariah	Zec	38	8	8	and I will bring them back and they will live in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God in truth and righteousness.'
Zechariah	Zec	38	8	9	"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Let your hands be strong, you who are listening in these days to these words from the mouth of the prophets, those who spoke in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, to the end that the temple might be built.
Zechariah	Zec	38	8	10	'For before those days there was no wage for man or any wage for animal; and for him who went out or came in there was no peace because of his enemies, and I set all men one against another.
Zechariah	Zec	38	8	11	'But now I will not treat the remnant of this people as in the former days,' declares the LORD of hosts.
Zechariah	Zec	38	8	12	'For there will be peace for the seed: the vine will yield its fruit, the land will yield its produce and the heavens will give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things.
Zechariah	Zec	38	8	13	'It will come about that just as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you that you may become a blessing. Do not fear; let your hands be strong.'
Zechariah	Zec	38	8	14	"For thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Just as I purposed to do harm to you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath,' says the LORD of hosts, 'and I have not relented,
Zechariah	Zec	38	8	15	so I have again purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not fear!
Zechariah	Zec	38	8	16	'These are the things which you should do: speak the truth to one another; judge with truth and judgment for peace in your gates.
Zechariah	Zec	38	8	17	'Also let none of you devise evil in your heart against another, and do not love perjury; for all these are what I hate,' declares the LORD."
Zechariah	Zec	38	8	18	Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,
Zechariah	Zec	38	8	19	"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'The fast of the fourth, the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth months will become joy, gladness, and cheerful feasts for the house of Judah; so love truth and peace.'
Zechariah	Zec	38	8	20	"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'It will yet be that peoples will come, even the inhabitants of many cities.
Zechariah	Zec	38	8	21	'The inhabitants of one will go to another, saying, "Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts; I will also go."
Zechariah	Zec	38	8	22	'So many peoples and mighty nations will come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of the LORD.'
Zechariah	Zec	38	8	23	"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'In those days ten men from all the nations will grasp the garment of a Jew, saying, "Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you."'"
Zechariah	Zec	38	9	1	The burden of the word of the LORD is against the land of Hadrach, with Damascus as its resting place (for the eyes of men, especially of all the tribes of Israel, are toward the LORD),
Zechariah	Zec	38	9	2	And Hamath also, which borders on it; Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise.
Zechariah	Zec	38	9	3	For Tyre built herself a fortress And piled up silver like dust, And gold like the mire of the streets.
Zechariah	Zec	38	9	4	Behold, the Lord will dispossess her And cast her wealth into the sea; And she will be consumed with fire.
Zechariah	Zec	38	9	5	Ashkelon will see it and be afraid. Gaza too will writhe in great pain; Also Ekron, for her expectation has been confounded. Moreover, the king will perish from Gaza, And Ashkelon will not be inhabited.
Zechariah	Zec	38	9	6	And a mongrel race will dwell in Ashdod, And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.
Zechariah	Zec	38	9	7	And I will remove their blood from their mouth And their detestable things from between their teeth. Then they also will be a remnant for our God, And be like a clan in Judah, And Ekron like a Jebusite.
Zechariah	Zec	38	9	8	But I will camp around My house because of an army, Because of him who passes by and returns; And no oppressor will pass over them anymore, For now I have seen with My eyes.
Zechariah	Zec	38	9	9	Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your king is coming to you; He is just and endowed with salvation, Humble, and mounted on a donkey, Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey.
Zechariah	Zec	38	9	10	I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim And the horse from Jerusalem; And the bow of war will be cut off. And He will speak peace to the nations; And His dominion will be from sea to sea, And from the River to the ends of the earth.
Zechariah	Zec	38	9	11	As for you also, because of the blood of My covenant with you, I have set your prisoners free from the waterless pit.
Zechariah	Zec	38	9	12	Return to the stronghold, O prisoners who have the hope; This very day I am declaring that I will restore double to you.
Zechariah	Zec	38	9	13	For I will bend Judah as My bow, I will fill the bow with Ephraim. And I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece; And I will make you like a warrior's sword.
Zechariah	Zec	38	9	14	Then the LORD will appear over them, And His arrow will go forth like lightning; And the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet, And will march in the storm winds of the south.
Zechariah	Zec	38	9	15	The LORD of hosts will defend them. And they will devour and trample on the sling stones; And they will drink and be boisterous as with wine; And they will be filled like a sacrificial basin, Drenched like the corners of the altar.
Zechariah	Zec	38	9	16	And the LORD their God will save them in that day As the flock of His people; For they are as the stones of a crown, Sparkling in His land.
Zechariah	Zec	38	9	17	For what comeliness and beauty will be theirs! Grain will make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins.
Zechariah	Zec	38	10	1	Ask rain from the LORD at the time of the spring rain-- The LORD who makes the storm clouds; And He will give them showers of rain, vegetation in the field to each man.
Zechariah	Zec	38	10	2	For the teraphim speak iniquity, And the diviners see lying visions And tell false dreams; They comfort in vain. Therefore the people wander like sheep, They are afflicted, because there is no shepherd.
Zechariah	Zec	38	10	3	"My anger is kindled against the shepherds, And I will punish the male goats; For the LORD of hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah, And will make them like His majestic horse in battle.
Zechariah	Zec	38	10	4	"From them will come the cornerstone, From them the tent peg, From them the bow of battle, From them every ruler, all of them together.
Zechariah	Zec	38	10	5	"They will be as mighty men, Treading down the enemy in the mire of the streets in battle; And they will fight, for the LORD will be with them; And the riders on horses will be put to shame.
Zechariah	Zec	38	10	6	"I will strengthen the house of Judah, And I will save the house of Joseph, And I will bring them back, Because I have had compassion on them; And they will be as though I had not rejected them, For I am the LORD their God and I will answer them.
Zechariah	Zec	38	10	7	"Ephraim will be like a mighty man, And their heart will be glad as if from wine; Indeed, their children will see it and be glad, Their heart will rejoice in the LORD.
Zechariah	Zec	38	10	8	"I will whistle for them to gather them together, For I have redeemed them; And they will be as numerous as they were before.
Zechariah	Zec	38	10	9	"When I scatter them among the peoples, They will remember Me in far countries, And they with their children will live and come back.
Zechariah	Zec	38	10	10	"I will bring them back from the land of Egypt And gather them from Assyria; And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon Until no room can be found for them.
Zechariah	Zec	38	10	11	"And they will pass through the sea of distress And He will strike the waves in the sea, So that all the depths of the Nile will dry up; And the pride of Assyria will be brought down And the scepter of Egypt will depart.
Zechariah	Zec	38	10	12	"And I will strengthen them in the LORD, And in His name they will walk," declares the LORD.
Zechariah	Zec	38	11	1	Open your doors, O Lebanon, That a fire may feed on your cedars.
Zechariah	Zec	38	11	2	Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen, Because the glorious trees have been destroyed; Wail, O oaks of Bashan, For the impenetrable forest has come down.
Zechariah	Zec	38	11	3	There is a sound of the shepherds' wail, For their glory is ruined; There is a sound of the young lions' roar, For the pride of the Jordan is ruined.
Zechariah	Zec	38	11	4	Thus says the LORD my God, "Pasture the flock doomed to slaughter.
Zechariah	Zec	38	11	5	"Those who buy them slay them and go unpunished, and each of those who sell them says, 'Blessed be the LORD, for I have become rich!' And their own shepherds have no pity on them.
Zechariah	Zec	38	11	6	"For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of the land," declares the LORD; "but behold, I will cause the men to fall, each into another's power and into the power of his king; and they will strike the land, and I will not deliver them from their power."
Zechariah	Zec	38	11	7	So I pastured the flock doomed to slaughter, hence the afflicted of the flock. And I took for myself two staffs: the one I called Favor and the other I called Union; so I pastured the flock.
Zechariah	Zec	38	11	8	Then I annihilated the three shepherds in one month, for my soul was impatient with them, and their soul also was weary of me.
Zechariah	Zec	38	11	9	Then I said, "I will not pasture you. What is to die, let it die, and what is to be annihilated, let it be annihilated; and let those who are left eat one another's flesh."
Zechariah	Zec	38	11	10	I took my staff Favor and cut it in pieces, to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples.
Zechariah	Zec	38	11	11	So it was broken on that day, and thus the afflicted of the flock who were watching me realized that it was the word of the LORD.
Zechariah	Zec	38	11	12	I said to them, "If it is good in your sight, give me my wages; but if not, never mind!" So they weighed out thirty shekels of silver as my wages.
Zechariah	Zec	38	11	13	Then the LORD said to me, "Throw it to the potter, that magnificent price at which I was valued by them." So I took the thirty shekels of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of the LORD.
Zechariah	Zec	38	11	14	Then I cut in pieces my second staff Union, to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
Zechariah	Zec	38	11	15	The LORD said to me, "Take again for yourself the equipment of a foolish shepherd.
Zechariah	Zec	38	11	16	"For behold, I am going to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not care for the perishing, seek the scattered, heal the broken, or sustain the one standing, but will devour the flesh of the fat sheep and tear off their hoofs.
Zechariah	Zec	38	11	17	"Woe to the worthless shepherd Who leaves the flock! A sword will be on his arm And on his right eye! His arm will be totally withered And his right eye will be blind."
Zechariah	Zec	38	12	1	The burden of the word of the LORD concerning Israel. T hus declares the LORD who stretches out the heavens, lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him,
Zechariah	Zec	38	12	2	"Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that causes reeling to all the peoples around; and when the siege is against Jerusalem, it will also be against Judah.
Zechariah	Zec	38	12	3	"It will come about in that day that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; all who lift it will be severely injured. And all the nations of the earth will be gathered against it.
Zechariah	Zec	38	12	4	"In that day," declares the LORD, "I will strike every horse with bewilderment and his rider with madness. But I will watch over the house of Judah, while I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness.
Zechariah	Zec	38	12	5	"Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, 'A strong support for us are the inhabitants of Jerusalem through the LORD of hosts, their God.'
Zechariah	Zec	38	12	6	"In that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot among pieces of wood and a flaming torch among sheaves, so they will consume on the right hand and on the left all the surrounding peoples, while the inhabitants of Jerusalem again dwell on their own sites in Jerusalem.
Zechariah	Zec	38	12	7	"The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will not be magnified above Judah.
Zechariah	Zec	38	12	8	"In that day the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the one who is feeble among them in that day will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the angel of the LORD before them.
Zechariah	Zec	38	12	9	"And in that day I will set about to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.
Zechariah	Zec	38	12	10	"I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplication, so that they will look on Me whom they have pierced; and they will mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son, and they will weep bitterly over Him like the bitter weeping over a firstborn.
Zechariah	Zec	38	12	11	"In that day there will be great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo.
Zechariah	Zec	38	12	12	"The land will mourn, every family by itself; the family of the house of David by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself and their wives by themselves;
Zechariah	Zec	38	12	13	the family of the house of Levi by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the Shimeites by itself and their wives by themselves;
Zechariah	Zec	38	12	14	all the families that remain, every family by itself and their wives by themselves.
Zechariah	Zec	38	13	1	"In that day a fountain will be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity.
Zechariah	Zec	38	13	2	"It will come about in that day," declares the LORD of hosts, "that I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, and they will no longer be remembered; and I will also remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land.
Zechariah	Zec	38	13	3	"And if anyone still prophesies, then his father and mother who gave birth to him will say to him, 'You shall not live, for you have spoken falsely in the name of the LORD'; and his father and mother who gave birth to him will pierce him through when he prophesies.
Zechariah	Zec	38	13	4	"Also it will come about in that day that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies, and they will not put on a hairy robe in order to deceive;
Zechariah	Zec	38	13	5	but he will say, 'I am not a prophet; I am a tiller of the ground, for a man sold me as a slave in my youth.'
Zechariah	Zec	38	13	6	"And one will say to him, 'What are these wounds between your arms?' Then he will say, 'Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.'
Zechariah	Zec	38	13	7	"Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, And against the man, My Associate," Declares the LORD of hosts. "Strike the Shepherd that the sheep may be scattered; And I will turn My hand against the little ones.
Zechariah	Zec	38	13	8	"It will come about in all the land," Declares the LORD, "That two parts in it will be cut off and perish; But the third will be left in it.
Zechariah	Zec	38	13	9	"And I will bring the third part through the fire, Refine them as silver is refined, And test them as gold is tested. They will call on My name, And I will answer them; I will say, 'They are My people,' And they will say, 'The LORD is my God.'"
Zechariah	Zec	38	14	1	Behold, a day is coming for the LORD when the spoil taken from you will be divided among you.
Zechariah	Zec	38	14	2	For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured, the houses plundered, the women ravished and half of the city exiled, but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city.
Zechariah	Zec	38	14	3	Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle.
Zechariah	Zec	38	14	4	In that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley, so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south.
Zechariah	Zec	38	14	5	You will flee by the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; yes, you will flee just as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the LORD, my God, will come, and all the holy ones with Him!
Zechariah	Zec	38	14	6	In that day there will be no light; the luminaries will dwindle.
Zechariah	Zec	38	14	7	For it will be a unique day which is known to the LORD, neither day nor night, but it will come about that at evening time there will be light.
Zechariah	Zec	38	14	8	And in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea; it will be in summer as well as in winter.
Zechariah	Zec	38	14	9	And the LORD will be king over all the earth; in that day the LORD will be the only one, and His name the only one.
Zechariah	Zec	38	14	10	All the land will be changed into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; but Jerusalem will rise and remain on its site from Benjamin's Gate as far as the place of the First Gate to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king's wine presses.
Zechariah	Zec	38	14	11	People will live in it, and there will no longer be a curse, for Jerusalem will dwell in security.
Zechariah	Zec	38	14	12	Now this will be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the peoples who have gone to war against Jerusalem; their flesh will rot while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongue will rot in their mouth.
Zechariah	Zec	38	14	13	It will come about in that day that a great panic from the LORD will fall on them; and they will seize one another's hand, and the hand of one will be lifted against the hand of another.
Zechariah	Zec	38	14	14	Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered, gold and silver and garments in great abundance.
Zechariah	Zec	38	14	15	So also like this plague will be the plague on the horse, the mule, the camel, the donkey and all the cattle that will be in those camps.
Zechariah	Zec	38	14	16	Then it will come about that any who are left of all the nations that went against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to celebrate the Feast of Booths.
Zechariah	Zec	38	14	17	And it will be that whichever of the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, there will be no rain on them.
Zechariah	Zec	38	14	18	If the family of Egypt does not go up or enter, then no rain will fall on them; it will be the plague with which the LORD smites the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths.
Zechariah	Zec	38	14	19	This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths.
Zechariah	Zec	38	14	20	In that day there will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, "HOLY TO THE LORD." And the cooking pots in the LORD'S house will be like the bowls before the altar.
Zechariah	Zec	38	14	21	Every cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the LORD of hosts; and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them. And there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts in that day.
Malachi	Mal	39	1	1	The oracle of the word of the LORD to Israel through Malachi.
Malachi	Mal	39	1	2	"I have loved you," says the LORD. But you say, "How have You loved us?" "Was not Esau Jacob's brother?" declares the LORD. "Yet I have loved Jacob;
Malachi	Mal	39	1	3	but I have hated Esau, and I have made his mountains a desolation and appointed his inheritance for the jackals of the wilderness."
Malachi	Mal	39	1	4	Though Edom says, "We have been beaten down, but we will return and build up the ruins"; thus says the LORD of hosts, "They may build, but I will tear down; and men will call them the wicked territory, and the people toward whom the LORD is indignant forever."
Malachi	Mal	39	1	5	Your eyes will see this and you will say, "The LORD be magnified beyond the border of Israel!"
Malachi	Mal	39	1	6	" 'A son honors his father, and a servant his master. Then if I am a father, where is My honor? And if I am a master, where is My respect?' says the LORD of hosts to you, O priests who despise My name. But you say, 'How have we despised Your name?'
Malachi	Mal	39	1	7	"You are presenting defiled food upon My altar. But you say, 'How have we defiled You?' In that you say, 'The table of the LORD is to be despised.'
Malachi	Mal	39	1	8	"But when you present the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? And when you present the lame and sick, is it not evil? Why not offer it to your governor? Would he be pleased with you? Or would he receive you kindly?" says the LORD of hosts.
Malachi	Mal	39	1	9	"But now will you not entreat God's favor, that He may be gracious to us? With such an offering on your part, will He receive any of you kindly?" says the LORD of hosts.
Malachi	Mal	39	1	10	"Oh that there were one among you who would shut the gates, that you might not uselessly kindle fire on My altar! I am not pleased with you," says the LORD of hosts, "nor will I accept an offering from you.
Malachi	Mal	39	1	11	"For from the rising of the sun even to its setting, My name will be great among the nations, and in every place incense is going to be offered to My name, and a grain offering that is pure; for My name will be great among the nations," says the LORD of hosts.
Malachi	Mal	39	1	12	"But you are profaning it, in that you say, 'The table of the Lord is defiled, and as for its fruit, its food is to be despised.'
Malachi	Mal	39	1	13	"You also say, 'My, how tiresome it is!' And you disdainfully sniff at it," says the LORD of hosts, "and you bring what was taken by robbery and what is lame or sick; so you bring the offering! Should I receive that from your hand?" says the LORD.
Malachi	Mal	39	1	14	"But cursed be the swindler who has a male in his flock and vows it, but sacrifices a blemished animal to the Lord, for I am a great King," says the LORD of hosts, "and My name is feared among the nations."
Malachi	Mal	39	2	1	"And now this commandment is for you, O priests.
Malachi	Mal	39	2	2	"If you do not listen, and if you do not take it to heart to give honor to My name," says the LORD of hosts, "then I will send the curse upon you and I will curse your blessings; and indeed, I have cursed them already, because you are not taking it to heart.
Malachi	Mal	39	2	3	"Behold, I am going to rebuke your offspring, and I will spread refuse on your faces, the refuse of your feasts; and you will be taken away with it.
Malachi	Mal	39	2	4	"Then you will know that I have sent this commandment to you, that My covenant may continue with Levi," says the LORD of hosts.
Malachi	Mal	39	2	5	"My covenant with him was one of life and peace, and I gave them to him as an object of reverence; so he revered Me and stood in awe of My name.
Malachi	Mal	39	2	6	"True instruction was in his mouth and unrighteousness was not found on his lips; he walked with Me in peace and uprightness, and he turned many back from iniquity.
Malachi	Mal	39	2	7	"For the lips of a priest should preserve knowledge, and men should seek instruction from his mouth; for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.
Malachi	Mal	39	2	8	"But as for you, you have turned aside from the way; you have caused many to stumble by the instruction; you have corrupted the covenant of Levi," says the LORD of hosts.
Malachi	Mal	39	2	9	"So I also have made you despised and abased before all the people, just as you are not keeping My ways but are showing partiality in the instruction.
Malachi	Mal	39	2	10	"Do we not all have one father? Has not one God created us? Why do we deal treacherously each against his brother so as to profane the covenant of our fathers?
Malachi	Mal	39	2	11	"Judah has dealt treacherously, and an abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the sanctuary of the LORD which He loves and has married the daughter of a foreign god.
Malachi	Mal	39	2	12	"As for the man who does this, may the LORD cut off from the tents of Jacob everyone who awakes and answers, or who presents an offering to the LORD of hosts.
Malachi	Mal	39	2	13	"This is another thing you do: you cover the altar of the LORD with tears, with weeping and with groaning, because He no longer regards the offering or accepts it with favor from your hand.
Malachi	Mal	39	2	14	"Yet you say, 'For what reason?' Because the LORD has been a witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have dealt treacherously, though she is your companion and your wife by covenant.
Malachi	Mal	39	2	15	"But not one has done so who has a remnant of the Spirit. And what did that one do while he was seeking a godly offspring? Take heed then to your spirit, and let no one deal treacherously against the wife of your youth.
Malachi	Mal	39	2	16	"For I hate divorce," says the LORD, the God of Israel, "and him who covers his garment with wrong," says the LORD of hosts. "So take heed to your spirit, that you do not deal treacherously."
Malachi	Mal	39	2	17	You have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet you say, "How have we wearied Him?" In that you say, "Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and He delights in them," or, "Where is the God of justice?"
Malachi	Mal	39	3	1	"Behold, I am going to send My messenger, and he will clear the way before Me. And the Lord, whom you seek, will suddenly come to His temple; and the messenger of the covenant, in whom you delight, behold, He is coming," says the LORD of hosts.
Malachi	Mal	39	3	2	"But who can endure the day of His coming? And who can stand when He appears? For He is like a refiner's fire and like fullers' soap.
Malachi	Mal	39	3	3	"He will sit as a smelter and purifier of silver, and He will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, so that they may present to the LORD offerings in righteousness.
Malachi	Mal	39	3	4	"Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the LORD as in the days of old and as in former years.
Malachi	Mal	39	3	5	"Then I will draw near to you for judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers and against the adulterers and against those who swear falsely, and against those who oppress the wage earner in his wages, the widow and the orphan, and those who turn aside the alien and do not fear Me," says the LORD of hosts.
Malachi	Mal	39	3	6	"For I, the LORD, do not change; therefore you, O sons of Jacob, are not consumed.
Malachi	Mal	39	3	7	"From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from My statutes and have not kept them. Return to Me, and I will return to you," says the LORD of hosts. "But you say, 'How shall we return?'
Malachi	Mal	39	3	8	"Will a man rob God? Yet you are robbing Me! But you say, 'How have we robbed You?' In tithes and offerings.
Malachi	Mal	39	3	9	"You are cursed with a curse, for you are robbing Me, the whole nation of you!
Malachi	Mal	39	3	10	"Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, so that there may be food in My house, and test Me now in this," says the LORD of hosts, "if I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out for you a blessing until it overflows.
Malachi	Mal	39	3	11	"Then I will rebuke the devourer for you, so that it will not destroy the fruits of the ground; nor will your vine in the field cast its grapes," says the LORD of hosts.
Malachi	Mal	39	3	12	"All the nations will call you blessed, for you shall be a delightful land," says the LORD of hosts.
Malachi	Mal	39	3	13	"Your words have been arrogant against Me," says the LORD. "Yet you say, 'What have we spoken against You?'
Malachi	Mal	39	3	14	"You have said, 'It is vain to serve God; and what profit is it that we have kept His charge, and that we have walked in mourning before the LORD of hosts?
Malachi	Mal	39	3	15	'So now we call the arrogant blessed; not only are the doers of wickedness built up but they also test God and escape.'"
Malachi	Mal	39	3	16	Then those who feared the LORD spoke to one another, and the LORD gave attention and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before Him for those who fear the LORD and who esteem His name.
Malachi	Mal	39	3	17	"They will be Mine," says the LORD of hosts, "on the day that I prepare My own possession, and I will spare them as a man spares his own son who serves him."
Malachi	Mal	39	3	18	So you will again distinguish between the righteous and the wicked, between one who serves God and one who does not serve Him.
Malachi	Mal	39	4	1	"For behold, the day is coming, burning like a furnace; and all the arrogant and every evildoer will be chaff; and the day that is coming will set them ablaze," says the LORD of hosts, "so that it will leave them neither root nor branch."
Malachi	Mal	39	4	2	"But for you who fear My name, the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings; and you will go forth and skip about like calves from the stall.
Malachi	Mal	39	4	3	"You will tread down the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day which I am preparing," says the LORD of hosts.
Malachi	Mal	39	4	4	"Remember the law of Moses My servant, even the statutes and ordinances which I commanded him in Horeb for all Israel.
Malachi	Mal	39	4	5	"Behold, I am going to send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and terrible day of the LORD.
Malachi	Mal	39	4	6	"He will restore the hearts of the fathers to their children and the hearts of the children to their fathers, so that I will not come and smite the land with a curse."
Matthew	Mat	40	1	1	The record of the genealogy of Jesus the Messiah, the son of David, the son of Abraham:
Matthew	Mat	40	1	2	Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers.
Matthew	Mat	40	1	3	Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez was the father of Hezron, and Hezron the father of Ram.
Matthew	Mat	40	1	4	Ram was the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon the father of Salmon.
Matthew	Mat	40	1	5	Salmon was the father of Boaz by Rahab, Boaz was the father of Obed by Ruth, and Obed the father of Jesse.
Matthew	Mat	40	1	6	Jesse was the father of David the king. David was the father of Solomon by Bathsheba who had been the wife of Uriah.
Matthew	Mat	40	1	7	Solomon was the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, and Abijah the father of Asa.
Matthew	Mat	40	1	8	Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, and Joram the father of Uzziah.
Matthew	Mat	40	1	9	Uzziah was the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah.
Matthew	Mat	40	1	10	Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, and Amon the father of Josiah.
Matthew	Mat	40	1	11	Josiah became the father of Jeconiah and his brothers, at the time of the deportation to Babylon.
Matthew	Mat	40	1	12	After the deportation to Babylon: Jeconiah became the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel.
Matthew	Mat	40	1	13	Zerubbabel was the father of Abihud, Abihud the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim the father of Azor.
Matthew	Mat	40	1	14	Azor was the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Achim, and Achim the father of Eliud.
Matthew	Mat	40	1	15	Eliud was the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, and Matthan the father of Jacob.
Matthew	Mat	40	1	16	Jacob was the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, by whom Jesus was born, who is called the Messiah.
Matthew	Mat	40	1	17	So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; from David to the deportation to Babylon, fourteen generations; and from the deportation to Babylon to the Messiah, fourteen generations.
Matthew	Mat	40	1	18	Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: when His mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit.
Matthew	Mat	40	1	19	And Joseph her husband, being a righteous man and not wanting to disgrace her, planned to send her away secretly.
Matthew	Mat	40	1	20	But when he had considered this, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife; for the Child who has been conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.
Matthew	Mat	40	1	21	"She will bear a Son; and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins."
Matthew	Mat	40	1	22	Now all this took place to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet:
Matthew	Mat	40	1	23	"BEHOLD, THE VIRGIN SHALL BE WITH CHILD AND SHALL BEAR A SON, AND THEY SHALL CALL HIS NAME IMMANUEL," which translated means, "GOD WITH US."
Matthew	Mat	40	1	24	And Joseph awoke from his sleep and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took Mary as his wife,
Matthew	Mat	40	1	25	but kept her a virgin until she gave birth to a Son; and he called His name Jesus.
Matthew	Mat	40	2	1	Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem, saying,
Matthew	Mat	40	2	2	"Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we saw His star in the east and have come to worship Him."
Matthew	Mat	40	2	3	When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
Matthew	Mat	40	2	4	Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Messiah was to be born.
Matthew	Mat	40	2	5	They said to him, "In Bethlehem of Judea; for this is what has been written by the prophet:
Matthew	Mat	40	2	6	'AND YOU, BETHLEHEM, LAND OF JUDAH, ARE BY NO MEANS LEAST AMONG THE LEADERS OF JUDAH; FOR OUT OF YOU SHALL COME FORTH A RULER WHO WILL SHEPHERD MY PEOPLE ISRAEL.'"
Matthew	Mat	40	2	7	Then Herod secretly called the magi and determined from them the exact time the star appeared.
Matthew	Mat	40	2	8	And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and search carefully for the Child; and when you have found Him, report to me, so that I too may come and worship Him."
Matthew	Mat	40	2	9	After hearing the king, they went their way; and the star, which they had seen in the east, went on before them until it came and stood over the place where the Child was.
Matthew	Mat	40	2	10	When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy.
Matthew	Mat	40	2	11	After coming into the house they saw the Child with Mary His mother; and they fell to the ground and worshiped Him. Then, opening their treasures, they presented to Him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
Matthew	Mat	40	2	12	And having been warned by God in a dream not to return to Herod, the magi left for their own country by another way.
Matthew	Mat	40	2	13	Now when they had gone, behold, an angel of the Lord *appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Get up! Take the Child and His mother and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you; for Herod is going to search for the Child to destroy Him."
Matthew	Mat	40	2	14	So Joseph got up and took the Child and His mother while it was still night, and left for Egypt.
Matthew	Mat	40	2	15	He remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet: "OUT OF EGYPT I CALLED MY SON."
Matthew	Mat	40	2	16	Then when Herod saw that he had been tricked by the magi, he became very enraged, and sent and slew all the male children who were in Bethlehem and all its vicinity, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had determined from the magi.
Matthew	Mat	40	2	17	Then what had been spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled:
Matthew	Mat	40	2	18	"A VOICE WAS HEARD IN RAMAH, WEEPING AND GREAT MOURNING, RACHEL WEEPING FOR HER CHILDREN; AND SHE REFUSED TO BE COMFORTED, BECAUSE THEY WERE NO MORE."
Matthew	Mat	40	2	19	But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord *appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, and said,
Matthew	Mat	40	2	20	"Get up, take the Child and His mother, and go into the land of Israel; for those who sought the Child's life are dead."
Matthew	Mat	40	2	21	So Joseph got up, took the Child and His mother, and came into the land of Israel.
Matthew	Mat	40	2	22	But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Then after being warned by God in a dream, he left for the regions of Galilee,
Matthew	Mat	40	2	23	and came and lived in a city called Nazareth. This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophets: "He shall be called a Nazarene."
Matthew	Mat	40	3	1	Now in those days John the Baptist *came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying,
Matthew	Mat	40	3	2	"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
Matthew	Mat	40	3	3	For this is the one referred to by Isaiah the prophet when he said, "THE VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS, 'MAKE READY THE WAY OF THE LORD, MAKE HIS PATHS STRAIGHT!'"
Matthew	Mat	40	3	4	Now John himself had a garment of camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey.
Matthew	Mat	40	3	5	Then Jerusalem was going out to him, and all Judea and all the district around the Jordan;
Matthew	Mat	40	3	6	and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, as they confessed their sins.
Matthew	Mat	40	3	7	But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said to them, "You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Matthew	Mat	40	3	8	"Therefore bear fruit in keeping with repentance;
Matthew	Mat	40	3	9	and do not suppose that you can say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our father'; for I say to you that from these stones God is able to raise up children to Abraham.
Matthew	Mat	40	3	10	"The axe is already laid at the root of the trees; therefore every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
Matthew	Mat	40	3	11	"As for me, I baptize you with water for repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, and I am not fit to remove His sandals; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
Matthew	Mat	40	3	12	"His winnowing fork is in His hand, and He will thoroughly clear His threshing floor; and He will gather His wheat into the barn, but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire."
Matthew	Mat	40	3	13	Then Jesus *arrived from Galilee at the Jordan coming to John, to be baptized by him.
Matthew	Mat	40	3	14	But John tried to prevent Him, saying, "I have need to be baptized by You, and do You come to me?"
Matthew	Mat	40	3	15	But Jesus answering said to him, "Permit it at this time; for in this way it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he *permitted Him.
Matthew	Mat	40	3	16	After being baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and lighting on Him,
Matthew	Mat	40	3	17	and behold, a voice out of the heavens said, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleased."
Matthew	Mat	40	4	1	Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
Matthew	Mat	40	4	2	And after He had fasted forty days and forty nights, He then became hungry.
Matthew	Mat	40	4	3	And the tempter came and said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread."
Matthew	Mat	40	4	4	But He answered and said, "It is written, 'MAN SHALL NOT LIVE ON BREAD ALONE, BUT ON EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF GOD.'"
Matthew	Mat	40	4	5	Then the devil *took Him into the holy city and had Him stand on the pinnacle of the temple,
Matthew	Mat	40	4	6	and *said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down; for it is written, 'HE WILL COMMAND HIS ANGELS CONCERNING YOU'; and 'ON their HANDS THEY WILL BEAR YOU UP, SO THAT YOU WILL NOT STRIKE YOUR FOOT AGAINST A STONE.'"
Matthew	Mat	40	4	7	Jesus said to him, "On the other hand, it is written, 'YOU SHALL NOT PUT THE LORD YOUR GOD TO THE TEST.'"
Matthew	Mat	40	4	8	Again, the devil *took Him to a very high mountain and *showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory;
Matthew	Mat	40	4	9	and he said to Him, "All these things I will give You, if You fall down and worship me."
Matthew	Mat	40	4	10	Then Jesus *said to him, "Go, Satan! For it is written, 'YOU SHALL WORSHIP THE LORD YOUR GOD, AND SERVE HIM ONLY.'"
Matthew	Mat	40	4	11	Then the devil *left Him; and behold, angels came and began to minister to Him.
Matthew	Mat	40	4	12	Now when Jesus heard that John had been taken into custody, He withdrew into Galilee;
Matthew	Mat	40	4	13	and leaving Nazareth, He came and settled in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
Matthew	Mat	40	4	14	This was to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet:
Matthew	Mat	40	4	15	"THE LAND OF ZEBULUN AND THE LAND OF NAPHTALI, BY THE WAY OF THE SEA, BEYOND THE JORDAN, GALILEE OF THE GENTILES--
Matthew	Mat	40	4	16	"THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SITTING IN DARKNESS SAW A GREAT LIGHT, AND THOSE WHO WERE SITTING IN THE LAND AND SHADOW OF DEATH, UPON THEM A LIGHT DAWNED."
Matthew	Mat	40	4	17	From that time Jesus began to preach and say, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
Matthew	Mat	40	4	18	Now as Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon who was called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.
Matthew	Mat	40	4	19	And He *said to them, "Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men."
Matthew	Mat	40	4	20	Immediately they left their nets and followed Him.
Matthew	Mat	40	4	21	Going on from there He saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and He called them.
Matthew	Mat	40	4	22	Immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed Him.
Matthew	Mat	40	4	23	Jesus was going throughout all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness among the people.
Matthew	Mat	40	4	24	The news about Him spread throughout all Syria; and they brought to Him all who were ill, those suffering with various diseases and pains, demoniacs, epileptics, paralytics; and He healed them.
Matthew	Mat	40	4	25	Large crowds followed Him from Galilee and the Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and from beyond the Jordan.
Matthew	Mat	40	5	1	When Jesus saw the crowds, He went up on the mountain; and after He sat down, His disciples came to Him.
Matthew	Mat	40	5	2	He opened His mouth and began to teach them, saying,
Matthew	Mat	40	5	3	"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew	Mat	40	5	4	"Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.
Matthew	Mat	40	5	5	"Blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth.
Matthew	Mat	40	5	6	"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.
Matthew	Mat	40	5	7	"Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.
Matthew	Mat	40	5	8	"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Matthew	Mat	40	5	9	"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
Matthew	Mat	40	5	10	"Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew	Mat	40	5	11	"Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me.
Matthew	Mat	40	5	12	"Rejoice and be glad, for your reward in heaven is great; for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
Matthew	Mat	40	5	13	"You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt has become tasteless, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled under foot by men.
Matthew	Mat	40	5	14	"You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden;
Matthew	Mat	40	5	15	nor does anyone light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house.
Matthew	Mat	40	5	16	"Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.
Matthew	Mat	40	5	17	"Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish but to fulfill.
Matthew	Mat	40	5	18	"For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law until all is accomplished.
Matthew	Mat	40	5	19	"Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do the same, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew	Mat	40	5	20	"For I say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew	Mat	40	5	21	"You have heard that the ancients were told, 'YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT MURDER' and 'Whoever commits murder shall be liable to the court.'
Matthew	Mat	40	5	22	"But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be guilty before the court; and whoever says to his brother, 'You good-for-nothing,' shall be guilty before the supreme court; and whoever says, 'You fool,' shall be guilty enough to go into the fiery hell.
Matthew	Mat	40	5	23	"Therefore if you are presenting your offering at the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you,
Matthew	Mat	40	5	24	leave your offering there before the altar and go; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and present your offering.
Matthew	Mat	40	5	25	"Make friends quickly with your opponent at law while you are with him on the way, so that your opponent may not hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.
Matthew	Mat	40	5	26	"Truly I say to you, you will not come out of there until you have paid up the last cent.
Matthew	Mat	40	5	27	"You have heard that it was said, 'YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY';
Matthew	Mat	40	5	28	but I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
Matthew	Mat	40	5	29	"If your right eye makes you stumble, tear it out and throw it from you; for it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your body, than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
Matthew	Mat	40	5	30	"If your right hand makes you stumble, cut it off and throw it from you; for it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your body, than for your whole body to go into hell.
Matthew	Mat	40	5	31	"It was said, 'WHOEVER SENDS HIS WIFE AWAY, LET HIM GIVE HER A CERTIFICATE OF DIVORCE';
Matthew	Mat	40	5	32	but I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except for the reason of unchastity, makes her commit adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
Matthew	Mat	40	5	33	"Again, you have heard that the ancients were told, 'YOU SHALL NOT MAKE FALSE VOWS, BUT SHALL FULFILL YOUR VOWS TO THE LORD.'
Matthew	Mat	40	5	34	"But I say to you, make no oath at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God,
Matthew	Mat	40	5	35	or by the earth, for it is the footstool of His feet, or by Jerusalem, for it is THE CITY OF THE GREAT KING.
Matthew	Mat	40	5	36	"Nor shall you make an oath by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black.
Matthew	Mat	40	5	37	"But let your statement be, 'Yes, yes' or 'No, no'; anything beyond these is of evil.
Matthew	Mat	40	5	38	"You have heard that it was said, 'AN EYE FOR AN EYE, AND A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH.'
Matthew	Mat	40	5	39	"But I say to you, do not resist an evil person; but whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also.
Matthew	Mat	40	5	40	"If anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, let him have your coat also.
Matthew	Mat	40	5	41	"Whoever forces you to go one mile, go with him two.
Matthew	Mat	40	5	42	"Give to him who asks of you, and do not turn away from him who wants to borrow from you.
Matthew	Mat	40	5	43	"You have heard that it was said, 'YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR and hate your enemy.'
Matthew	Mat	40	5	44	"But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,
Matthew	Mat	40	5	45	so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
Matthew	Mat	40	5	46	"For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?
Matthew	Mat	40	5	47	"If you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?
Matthew	Mat	40	5	48	"Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Matthew	Mat	40	6	1	"Beware of practicing your righteousness before men to be noticed by them; otherwise you have no reward with your Father who is in heaven.
Matthew	Mat	40	6	2	"So when you give to the poor, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be honored by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full.
Matthew	Mat	40	6	3	"But when you give to the poor, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,
Matthew	Mat	40	6	4	so that your giving will be in secret; and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you.
Matthew	Mat	40	6	5	"When you pray, you are not to be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners so that they may be seen by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full.
Matthew	Mat	40	6	6	"But you, when you pray, go into your inner room, close your door and pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you.
Matthew	Mat	40	6	7	"And when you are praying, do not use meaningless repetition as the Gentiles do, for they suppose that they will be heard for their many words.
Matthew	Mat	40	6	8	"So do not be like them; for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him.
Matthew	Mat	40	6	9	"Pray, then, in this way: 'Our Father who is in heaven, Hallowed be Your name.
Matthew	Mat	40	6	10	'Your kingdom come. Your will be done, On earth as it is in heaven.
Matthew	Mat	40	6	11	'Give us this day our daily bread.
Matthew	Mat	40	6	12	'And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.
Matthew	Mat	40	6	13	'And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from evil. [For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.']
Matthew	Mat	40	6	14	"For if you forgive others for their transgressions, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
Matthew	Mat	40	6	15	"But if you do not forgive others, then your Father will not forgive your transgressions.
Matthew	Mat	40	6	16	"Whenever you fast, do not put on a gloomy face as the hypocrites do, for they neglect their appearance so that they will be noticed by men when they are fasting. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full.
Matthew	Mat	40	6	17	"But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face
Matthew	Mat	40	6	18	so that your fasting will not be noticed by men, but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you.
Matthew	Mat	40	6	19	"Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
Matthew	Mat	40	6	20	"But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal;
Matthew	Mat	40	6	21	for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
Matthew	Mat	40	6	22	"The eye is the lamp of the body; so then if your eye is clear, your whole body will be full of light.
Matthew	Mat	40	6	23	"But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!
Matthew	Mat	40	6	24	"No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.
Matthew	Mat	40	6	25	"For this reason I say to you, do not be worried about your life, as to what you will eat or what you will drink; nor for your body, as to what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
Matthew	Mat	40	6	26	"Look at the birds of the air, that they do not sow, nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth much more than they?
Matthew	Mat	40	6	27	"And who of you by being worried can add a single hour to his life?
Matthew	Mat	40	6	28	"And why are you worried about clothing? Observe how the lilies of the field grow; they do not toil nor do they spin,
Matthew	Mat	40	6	29	yet I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these.
Matthew	Mat	40	6	30	"But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, will He not much more clothe you? You of little faith!
Matthew	Mat	40	6	31	"Do not worry then, saying, 'What will we eat?' or 'What will we drink?' or 'What will we wear for clothing?'
Matthew	Mat	40	6	32	"For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.
Matthew	Mat	40	6	33	"But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
Matthew	Mat	40	6	34	"So do not worry about tomorrow; for tomorrow will care for itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Matthew	Mat	40	7	1	"Do not judge so that you will not be judged.
Matthew	Mat	40	7	2	"For in the way you judge, you will be judged; and by your standard of measure, it will be measured to you.
Matthew	Mat	40	7	3	"Why do you look at the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?
Matthew	Mat	40	7	4	"Or how can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' and behold, the log is in your own eye?
Matthew	Mat	40	7	5	"You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.
Matthew	Mat	40	7	6	"Do not give what is holy to dogs, and do not throw your pearls before swine, or they will trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces.
Matthew	Mat	40	7	7	"Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.
Matthew	Mat	40	7	8	"For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.
Matthew	Mat	40	7	9	"Or what man is there among you who, when his son asks for a loaf, will give him a stone?
Matthew	Mat	40	7	10	"Or if he asks for a fish, he will not give him a snake, will he?
Matthew	Mat	40	7	11	"If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give what is good to those who ask Him!
Matthew	Mat	40	7	12	"In everything, therefore, treat people the same way you want them to treat you, for this is the Law and the Prophets.
Matthew	Mat	40	7	13	"Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it.
Matthew	Mat	40	7	14	"For the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life, and there are few who find it.
Matthew	Mat	40	7	15	"Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves.
Matthew	Mat	40	7	16	"You will know them by their fruits. Grapes are not gathered from thorn bushes nor figs from thistles, are they?
Matthew	Mat	40	7	17	"So every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit.
Matthew	Mat	40	7	18	"A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, nor can a bad tree produce good fruit.
Matthew	Mat	40	7	19	"Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
Matthew	Mat	40	7	20	"So then, you will know them by their fruits.
Matthew	Mat	40	7	21	"Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father who is in heaven will enter.
Matthew	Mat	40	7	22	"Many will say to Me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name perform many miracles?'
Matthew	Mat	40	7	23	"And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you; DEPART FROM ME, YOU WHO PRACTICE LAWLESSNESS.'
Matthew	Mat	40	7	24	"Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them, may be compared to a wise man who built his house on the rock.
Matthew	Mat	40	7	25	"And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and yet it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock.
Matthew	Mat	40	7	26	"Everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not act on them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.
Matthew	Mat	40	7	27	"The rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and it fell--and great was its fall."
Matthew	Mat	40	7	28	When Jesus had finished these words, the crowds were amazed at His teaching;
Matthew	Mat	40	7	29	for He was teaching them as one having authority, and not as their scribes.
Matthew	Mat	40	8	1	When Jesus came down from the mountain, large crowds followed Him.
Matthew	Mat	40	8	2	And a leper came to Him and bowed down before Him, and said, "Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean."
Matthew	Mat	40	8	3	Jesus stretched out His hand and touched him, saying, "I am willing; be cleansed." And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
Matthew	Mat	40	8	4	And Jesus *said to him, "See that you tell no one; but go, show yourself to the priest and present the offering that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them."
Matthew	Mat	40	8	5	And when Jesus entered Capernaum, a centurion came to Him, imploring Him,
Matthew	Mat	40	8	6	and saying, "Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home, fearfully tormented."
Matthew	Mat	40	8	7	Jesus *said to him, "I will come and heal him."
Matthew	Mat	40	8	8	But the centurion said, "Lord, I am not worthy for You to come under my roof, but just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
Matthew	Mat	40	8	9	"For I also am a man under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to this one, 'Go!' and he goes, and to another, 'Come!' and he comes, and to my slave, 'Do this!' and he does it."
Matthew	Mat	40	8	10	Now when Jesus heard this, He marveled and said to those who were following, "Truly I say to you, I have not found such great faith with anyone in Israel.
Matthew	Mat	40	8	11	"I say to you that many will come from east and west, and recline at the table with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven;
Matthew	Mat	40	8	12	but the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
Matthew	Mat	40	8	13	And Jesus said to the centurion, "Go; it shall be done for you as you have believed." And the servant was healed that very moment.
Matthew	Mat	40	8	14	When Jesus came into Peter's home, He saw his mother-in-law lying sick in bed with a fever.
Matthew	Mat	40	8	15	He touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she got up and waited on Him.
Matthew	Mat	40	8	16	When evening came, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed; and He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were ill.
Matthew	Mat	40	8	17	This was to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet: "HE HIMSELF TOOK OUR INFIRMITIES AND CARRIED AWAY OUR DISEASES."
Matthew	Mat	40	8	18	Now when Jesus saw a crowd around Him, He gave orders to depart to the other side of the sea.
Matthew	Mat	40	8	19	Then a scribe came and said to Him, "Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go."
Matthew	Mat	40	8	20	Jesus *said to him, "The foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head."
Matthew	Mat	40	8	21	Another of the disciples said to Him, "Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father."
Matthew	Mat	40	8	22	But Jesus *said to him, "Follow Me, and allow the dead to bury their own dead."
Matthew	Mat	40	8	23	When He got into the boat, His disciples followed Him.
Matthew	Mat	40	8	24	And behold, there arose a great storm on the sea, so that the boat was being covered with the waves; but Jesus Himself was asleep.
Matthew	Mat	40	8	25	And they came to Him and woke Him, saying, "Save us, Lord; we are perishing!"
Matthew	Mat	40	8	26	He *said to them, "Why are you afraid, you men of little faith?" Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and it became perfectly calm.
Matthew	Mat	40	8	27	The men were amazed, and said, "What kind of a man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?"
Matthew	Mat	40	8	28	When He came to the other side into the country of the Gadarenes, two men who were demon-possessed met Him as they were coming out of the tombs. They were so extremely violent that no one could pass by that way.
Matthew	Mat	40	8	29	And they cried out, saying, "What business do we have with each other, Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?"
Matthew	Mat	40	8	30	Now there was a herd of many swine feeding at a distance from them.
Matthew	Mat	40	8	31	The demons began to entreat Him, saying, "If You are going to cast us out, send us into the herd of swine."
Matthew	Mat	40	8	32	And He said to them, "Go!" And they came out and went into the swine, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and perished in the waters.
Matthew	Mat	40	8	33	The herdsmen ran away, and went to the city and reported everything, including what had happened to the demoniacs.
Matthew	Mat	40	8	34	And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw Him, they implored Him to leave their region.
Matthew	Mat	40	9	1	Getting into a boat, Jesus crossed over the sea and came to His own city.
Matthew	Mat	40	9	2	And they brought to Him a paralytic lying on a bed. Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralytic, "Take courage, son; your sins are forgiven."
Matthew	Mat	40	9	3	And some of the scribes said to themselves, "This fellow blasphemes."
Matthew	Mat	40	9	4	And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, "Why are you thinking evil in your hearts?
Matthew	Mat	40	9	5	"Which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, and walk'?
Matthew	Mat	40	9	6	"But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins"--then He *said to the paralytic, "Get up, pick up your bed and go home."
Matthew	Mat	40	9	7	And he got up and went home.
Matthew	Mat	40	9	8	But when the crowds saw this, they were awestruck, and glorified God, who had given such authority to men.
Matthew	Mat	40	9	9	As Jesus went on from there, He saw a man called Matthew, sitting in the tax collector's booth; and He *said to him, "Follow Me!" And he got up and followed Him.
Matthew	Mat	40	9	10	Then it happened that as Jesus was reclining at the table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and were dining with Jesus and His disciples.
Matthew	Mat	40	9	11	When the Pharisees saw this, they said to His disciples, "Why is your Teacher eating with the tax collectors and sinners?"
Matthew	Mat	40	9	12	But when Jesus heard this, He said, "It is not those who are healthy who need a physician, but those who are sick.
Matthew	Mat	40	9	13	"But go and learn what this means: 'I DESIRE COMPASSION, AND NOT SACRIFICE,' for I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners."
Matthew	Mat	40	9	14	Then the disciples of John *came to Him, asking, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast, but Your disciples do not fast?"
Matthew	Mat	40	9	15	And Jesus said to them, "The attendants of the bridegroom cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them, can they? But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast.
Matthew	Mat	40	9	16	"But no one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear results.
Matthew	Mat	40	9	17	"Nor do people put new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the wineskins burst, and the wine pours out and the wineskins are ruined; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved."
Matthew	Mat	40	9	18	While He was saying these things to them, a synagogue official came and bowed down before Him, and said, "My daughter has just died; but come and lay Your hand on her, and she will live."
Matthew	Mat	40	9	19	Jesus got up and began to follow him, and so did His disciples.
Matthew	Mat	40	9	20	And a woman who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years, came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His cloak;
Matthew	Mat	40	9	21	for she was saying to herself, "If I only touch His garment, I will get well."
Matthew	Mat	40	9	22	But Jesus turning and seeing her said, "Daughter, take courage; your faith has made you well." At once the woman was made well.
Matthew	Mat	40	9	23	When Jesus came into the official's house, and saw the flute-players and the crowd in noisy disorder,
Matthew	Mat	40	9	24	He said, "Leave; for the girl has not died, but is asleep." And they began laughing at Him.
Matthew	Mat	40	9	25	But when the crowd had been sent out, He entered and took her by the hand, and the girl got up.
Matthew	Mat	40	9	26	This news spread throughout all that land.
Matthew	Mat	40	9	27	As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
Matthew	Mat	40	9	28	When He entered the house, the blind men came up to Him, and Jesus *said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They *said to Him, "Yes, Lord."
Matthew	Mat	40	9	29	Then He touched their eyes, saying, "It shall be done to you according to your faith."
Matthew	Mat	40	9	30	And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly warned them: "See that no one knows about this!"
Matthew	Mat	40	9	31	But they went out and spread the news about Him throughout all that land.
Matthew	Mat	40	9	32	As they were going out, a mute, demon-possessed man was brought to Him.
Matthew	Mat	40	9	33	After the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke; and the crowds were amazed, and were saying, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel."
Matthew	Mat	40	9	34	But the Pharisees were saying, "He casts out the demons by the ruler of the demons."
Matthew	Mat	40	9	35	Jesus was going through all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness.
Matthew	Mat	40	9	36	Seeing the people, He felt compassion for them, because they were distressed and dispirited like sheep without a shepherd.
Matthew	Mat	40	9	37	Then He *said to His disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.
Matthew	Mat	40	9	38	"Therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into His harvest."
Matthew	Mat	40	10	1	Jesus summoned His twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every kind of disease and every kind of sickness.
Matthew	Mat	40	10	2	Now the names of the twelve apostles are these: The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; and James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;
Matthew	Mat	40	10	3	Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;
Matthew	Mat	40	10	4	Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, the one who betrayed Him.
Matthew	Mat	40	10	5	These twelve Jesus sent out after instructing them: "Do not go in the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter any city of the Samaritans;
Matthew	Mat	40	10	6	but rather go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
Matthew	Mat	40	10	7	"And as you go, preach, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.'
Matthew	Mat	40	10	8	"Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. Freely you received, freely give.
Matthew	Mat	40	10	9	"Do not acquire gold, or silver, or copper for your money belts,
Matthew	Mat	40	10	10	or a bag for your journey, or even two coats, or sandals, or a staff; for the worker is worthy of his support.
Matthew	Mat	40	10	11	"And whatever city or village you enter, inquire who is worthy in it, and stay at his house until you leave that city.
Matthew	Mat	40	10	12	"As you enter the house, give it your greeting.
Matthew	Mat	40	10	13	"If the house is worthy, give it your blessing of peace. But if it is not worthy, take back your blessing of peace.
Matthew	Mat	40	10	14	"Whoever does not receive you, nor heed your words, as you go out of that house or that city, shake the dust off your feet.
Matthew	Mat	40	10	15	"Truly I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.
Matthew	Mat	40	10	16	"Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves; so be shrewd as serpents and innocent as doves.
Matthew	Mat	40	10	17	"But beware of men, for they will hand you over to the courts and scourge you in their synagogues;
Matthew	Mat	40	10	18	and you will even be brought before governors and kings for My sake, as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.
Matthew	Mat	40	10	19	"But when they hand you over, do not worry about how or what you are to say; for it will be given you in that hour what you are to say.
Matthew	Mat	40	10	20	"For it is not you who speak, but it is the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.
Matthew	Mat	40	10	21	"Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death.
Matthew	Mat	40	10	22	"You will be hated by all because of My name, but it is the one who has endured to the end who will be saved.
Matthew	Mat	40	10	23	"But whenever they persecute you in one city, flee to the next; for truly I say to you, you will not finish going through the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes.
Matthew	Mat	40	10	24	"A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a slave above his master.
Matthew	Mat	40	10	25	"It is enough for the disciple that he become like his teacher, and the slave like his master. If they have called the head of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they malign the members of his household!
Matthew	Mat	40	10	26	"Therefore do not fear them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known.
Matthew	Mat	40	10	27	"What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered in your ear, proclaim upon the housetops.
Matthew	Mat	40	10	28	"Do not fear those who kill the body but are unable to kill the soul; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
Matthew	Mat	40	10	29	"Are not two sparrows sold for a cent? And yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father.
Matthew	Mat	40	10	30	"But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
Matthew	Mat	40	10	31	"So do not fear; you are more valuable than many sparrows.
Matthew	Mat	40	10	32	"Therefore everyone who confesses Me before men, I will also confess him before My Father who is in heaven.
Matthew	Mat	40	10	33	"But whoever denies Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father who is in heaven.
Matthew	Mat	40	10	34	"Do not think that I came to bring peace on the earth; I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.
Matthew	Mat	40	10	35	"For I came to SET A MAN AGAINST HIS FATHER, AND A DAUGHTER AGAINST HER MOTHER, AND A DAUGHTER-IN-LAW AGAINST HER MOTHER-IN-LAW;
Matthew	Mat	40	10	36	and A MAN'S ENEMIES WILL BE THE MEMBERS OF HIS HOUSEHOLD.
Matthew	Mat	40	10	37	"He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me.
Matthew	Mat	40	10	38	"And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me.
Matthew	Mat	40	10	39	"He who has found his life will lose it, and he who has lost his life for My sake will find it.
Matthew	Mat	40	10	40	"He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me.
Matthew	Mat	40	10	41	"He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.
Matthew	Mat	40	10	42	"And whoever in the name of a disciple gives to one of these little ones even a cup of cold water to drink, truly I say to you, he shall not lose his reward."
Matthew	Mat	40	11	1	When Jesus had finished giving instructions to His twelve disciples, He departed from there to teach and preach in their cities.
Matthew	Mat	40	11	2	Now when John, while imprisoned, heard of the works of Christ, he sent word by his disciples
Matthew	Mat	40	11	3	and said to Him, "Are You the Expected One, or shall we look for someone else?"
Matthew	Mat	40	11	4	Jesus answered and said to them, "Go and report to John what you hear and see:
Matthew	Mat	40	11	5	the BLIND RECEIVE SIGHT and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the POOR HAVE THE GOSPEL PREACHED TO THEM.
Matthew	Mat	40	11	6	"And blessed is he who does not take offense at Me."
Matthew	Mat	40	11	7	As these men were going away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?
Matthew	Mat	40	11	8	"But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Those who wear soft clothing are in kings' palaces!
Matthew	Mat	40	11	9	"But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and one who is more than a prophet.
Matthew	Mat	40	11	10	"This is the one about whom it is written, 'BEHOLD, I SEND MY MESSENGER AHEAD OF YOU, WHO WILL PREPARE YOUR WAY BEFORE YOU.'
Matthew	Mat	40	11	11	"Truly I say to you, among those born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptist! Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
Matthew	Mat	40	11	12	"From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and violent men take it by force.
Matthew	Mat	40	11	13	"For all the prophets and the Law prophesied until John.
Matthew	Mat	40	11	14	"And if you are willing to accept it, John himself is Elijah who was to come.
Matthew	Mat	40	11	15	"He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
Matthew	Mat	40	11	16	"But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the market places, who call out to the other children,
Matthew	Mat	40	11	17	and say, 'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.'
Matthew	Mat	40	11	18	"For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon!'
Matthew	Mat	40	11	19	"The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' Yet wisdom is vindicated by her deeds."
Matthew	Mat	40	11	20	Then He began to denounce the cities in which most of His miracles were done, because they did not repent.
Matthew	Mat	40	11	21	"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles had occurred in Tyre and Sidon which occurred in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
Matthew	Mat	40	11	22	"Nevertheless I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you.
Matthew	Mat	40	11	23	"And you, Capernaum, will not be exalted to heaven, will you? You will descend to Hades; for if the miracles had occurred in Sodom which occurred in you, it would have remained to this day.
Matthew	Mat	40	11	24	"Nevertheless I say to you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for you."
Matthew	Mat	40	11	25	At that time Jesus said, "I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants.
Matthew	Mat	40	11	26	"Yes, Father, for this way was well-pleasing in Your sight.
Matthew	Mat	40	11	27	"All things have been handed over to Me by My Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father; nor does anyone know the Father except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son wills to reveal Him.
Matthew	Mat	40	11	28	"Come to Me, all who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.
Matthew	Mat	40	11	29	"Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and YOU WILL FIND REST FOR YOUR SOULS.
Matthew	Mat	40	11	30	"For My yoke is easy and My burden is light."
Matthew	Mat	40	12	1	At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath, and His disciples became hungry and began to pick the heads of grain and eat.
Matthew	Mat	40	12	2	But when the Pharisees saw this, they said to Him, "Look, Your disciples do what is not lawful to do on a Sabbath."
Matthew	Mat	40	12	3	But He said to them, "Have you not read what David did when he became hungry, he and his companions,
Matthew	Mat	40	12	4	how he entered the house of God, and they ate the consecrated bread, which was not lawful for him to eat nor for those with him, but for the priests alone?
Matthew	Mat	40	12	5	"Or have you not read in the Law, that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple break the Sabbath and are innocent?
Matthew	Mat	40	12	6	"But I say to you that something greater than the temple is here.
Matthew	Mat	40	12	7	"But if you had known what this means, 'I DESIRE COMPASSION, AND NOT A SACRIFICE,' you would not have condemned the innocent.
Matthew	Mat	40	12	8	"For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
Matthew	Mat	40	12	9	Departing from there, He went into their synagogue.
Matthew	Mat	40	12	10	And a man was there whose hand was withered. And they questioned Jesus, asking, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"--so that they might accuse Him.
Matthew	Mat	40	12	11	And He said to them, "What man is there among you who has a sheep, and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will he not take hold of it and lift it out?
Matthew	Mat	40	12	12	"How much more valuable then is a man than a sheep! So then, it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath."
Matthew	Mat	40	12	13	Then He *said to the man, "Stretch out your hand!" He stretched it out, and it was restored to normal, like the other.
Matthew	Mat	40	12	14	But the Pharisees went out and conspired against Him, as to how they might destroy Him.
Matthew	Mat	40	12	15	But Jesus, aware of this, withdrew from there. Many followed Him, and He healed them all,
Matthew	Mat	40	12	16	and warned them not to tell who He was.
Matthew	Mat	40	12	17	This was to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet:
Matthew	Mat	40	12	18	"BEHOLD, MY SERVANT WHOM I HAVE CHOSEN; MY BELOVED IN WHOM MY SOUL is WELL-PLEASED; I WILL PUT MY SPIRIT UPON HIM, AND HE SHALL PROCLAIM JUSTICE TO THE GENTILES.
Matthew	Mat	40	12	19	"HE WILL NOT QUARREL, NOR CRY OUT; NOR WILL ANYONE HEAR HIS VOICE IN THE STREETS.
Matthew	Mat	40	12	20	"A BATTERED REED HE WILL NOT BREAK OFF, AND A SMOLDERING WICK HE WILL NOT PUT OUT, UNTIL HE LEADS JUSTICE TO VICTORY.
Matthew	Mat	40	12	21	"AND IN HIS NAME THE GENTILES WILL HOPE."
Matthew	Mat	40	12	22	Then a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute was brought to Jesus, and He healed him, so that the mute man spoke and saw.
Matthew	Mat	40	12	23	All the crowds were amazed, and were saying, "This man cannot be the Son of David, can he?"
Matthew	Mat	40	12	24	But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man casts out demons only by Beelzebul the ruler of the demons."
Matthew	Mat	40	12	25	And knowing their thoughts Jesus said to them, "Any kingdom divided against itself is laid waste; and any city or house divided against itself will not stand.
Matthew	Mat	40	12	26	"If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand?
Matthew	Mat	40	12	27	"If I by Beelzebul cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? For this reason they will be your judges.
Matthew	Mat	40	12	28	"But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
Matthew	Mat	40	12	29	"Or how can anyone enter the strong man's house and carry off his property, unless he first binds the strong man? And then he will plunder his house.
Matthew	Mat	40	12	30	"He who is not with Me is against Me; and he who does not gather with Me scatters.
Matthew	Mat	40	12	31	"Therefore I say to you, any sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven.
Matthew	Mat	40	12	32	"Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, either in this age or in the age to come.
Matthew	Mat	40	12	33	"Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad; for the tree is known by its fruit.
Matthew	Mat	40	12	34	"You brood of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak what is good? For the mouth speaks out of that which fills the heart.
Matthew	Mat	40	12	35	"The good man brings out of his good treasure what is good; and the evil man brings out of his evil treasure what is evil.
Matthew	Mat	40	12	36	"But I tell you that every careless word that people speak, they shall give an accounting for it in the day of judgment.
Matthew	Mat	40	12	37	"For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned."
Matthew	Mat	40	12	38	Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to Him, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from You."
Matthew	Mat	40	12	39	But He answered and said to them, "An evil and adulterous generation craves for a sign; and yet no sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet;
Matthew	Mat	40	12	40	for just as JONAH WAS THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS IN THE BELLY OF THE SEA MONSTER, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
Matthew	Mat	40	12	41	"The men of Nineveh will stand up with this generation at the judgment, and will condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
Matthew	Mat	40	12	42	"The Queen of the South will rise up with this generation at the judgment and will condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.
Matthew	Mat	40	12	43	"Now when the unclean spirit goes out of a man, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, and does not find it.
Matthew	Mat	40	12	44	"Then it says, 'I will return to my house from which I came'; and when it comes, it finds it unoccupied, swept, and put in order.
Matthew	Mat	40	12	45	"Then it goes and takes along with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. That is the way it will also be with this evil generation."
Matthew	Mat	40	12	46	While He was still speaking to the crowds, behold, His mother and brothers were standing outside, seeking to speak to Him.
Matthew	Mat	40	12	47	Someone said to Him, "Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside seeking to speak to You."
Matthew	Mat	40	12	48	But Jesus answered the one who was telling Him and said, "Who is My mother and who are My brothers?"
Matthew	Mat	40	12	49	And stretching out His hand toward His disciples, He said, "Behold My mother and My brothers!
Matthew	Mat	40	12	50	"For whoever does the will of My Father who is in heaven, he is My brother and sister and mother."
Matthew	Mat	40	13	1	That day Jesus went out of the house and was sitting by the sea.
Matthew	Mat	40	13	2	And large crowds gathered to Him, so He got into a boat and sat down, and the whole crowd was standing on the beach.
Matthew	Mat	40	13	3	And He spoke many things to them in parables, saying, "Behold, the sower went out to sow;
Matthew	Mat	40	13	4	and as he sowed, some seeds fell beside the road, and the birds came and ate them up.
Matthew	Mat	40	13	5	"Others fell on the rocky places, where they did not have much soil; and immediately they sprang up, because they had no depth of soil.
Matthew	Mat	40	13	6	"But when the sun had risen, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.
Matthew	Mat	40	13	7	"Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns came up and choked them out.
Matthew	Mat	40	13	8	"And others fell on the good soil and *yielded a crop, some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty.
Matthew	Mat	40	13	9	"He who has ears, let him hear."
Matthew	Mat	40	13	10	And the disciples came and said to Him, "Why do You speak to them in parables?"
Matthew	Mat	40	13	11	Jesus answered them, "To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been granted.
Matthew	Mat	40	13	12	"For whoever has, to him more shall be given, and he will have an abundance; but whoever does not have, even what he has shall be taken away from him.
Matthew	Mat	40	13	13	"Therefore I speak to them in parables; because while seeing they do not see, and while hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.
Matthew	Mat	40	13	14	"In their case the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled, which says, 'YOU WILL KEEP ON HEARING, BUT WILL NOT UNDERSTAND; YOU WILL KEEP ON SEEING, BUT WILL NOT PERCEIVE;
Matthew	Mat	40	13	15	FOR THE HEART OF THIS PEOPLE HAS BECOME DULL, WITH THEIR EARS THEY SCARCELY HEAR, AND THEY HAVE CLOSED THEIR EYES, OTHERWISE THEY WOULD SEE WITH THEIR EYES, HEAR WITH THEIR EARS, AND UNDERSTAND WITH THEIR HEART AND RETURN, AND I WOULD HEAL THEM.'
Matthew	Mat	40	13	16	"But blessed are your eyes, because they see; and your ears, because they hear.
Matthew	Mat	40	13	17	"For truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.
Matthew	Mat	40	13	18	"Hear then the parable of the sower.
Matthew	Mat	40	13	19	"When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is the one on whom seed was sown beside the road.
Matthew	Mat	40	13	20	"The one on whom seed was sown on the rocky places, this is the man who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy;
Matthew	Mat	40	13	21	yet he has no firm root in himself, but is only temporary, and when affliction or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he falls away.
Matthew	Mat	40	13	22	"And the one on whom seed was sown among the thorns, this is the man who hears the word, and the worry of the world and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
Matthew	Mat	40	13	23	"And the one on whom seed was sown on the good soil, this is the man who hears the word and understands it; who indeed bears fruit and brings forth, some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty."
Matthew	Mat	40	13	24	Jesus presented another parable to them, saying, "The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field.
Matthew	Mat	40	13	25	"But while his men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went away.
Matthew	Mat	40	13	26	"But when the wheat sprouted and bore grain, then the tares became evident also.
Matthew	Mat	40	13	27	"The slaves of the landowner came and said to him, 'Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have tares?'
Matthew	Mat	40	13	28	"And he said to them, 'An enemy has done this!' The slaves *said to him, 'Do you want us, then, to go and gather them up?'
Matthew	Mat	40	13	29	"But he *said, 'No; for while you are gathering up the tares, you may uproot the wheat with them.
Matthew	Mat	40	13	30	'Allow both to grow together until the harvest; and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, "First gather up the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them up; but gather the wheat into my barn."'"
Matthew	Mat	40	13	31	He presented another parable to them, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field;
Matthew	Mat	40	13	32	and this is smaller than all other seeds, but when it is full grown, it is larger than the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that THE BIRDS OF THE AIR come and NEST IN ITS BRANCHES."
Matthew	Mat	40	13	33	He spoke another parable to them, "The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three pecks of flour until it was all leavened."
Matthew	Mat	40	13	34	All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables, and He did not speak to them without a parable.
Matthew	Mat	40	13	35	This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet: "I WILL OPEN MY MOUTH IN PARABLES; I WILL UTTER THINGS HIDDEN SINCE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD."
Matthew	Mat	40	13	36	Then He left the crowds and went into the house. And His disciples came to Him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field."
Matthew	Mat	40	13	37	And He said, "The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man,
Matthew	Mat	40	13	38	and the field is the world; and as for the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil one;
Matthew	Mat	40	13	39	and the enemy who sowed them is the devil, and the harvest is the end of the age; and the reapers are angels.
Matthew	Mat	40	13	40	"So just as the tares are gathered up and burned with fire, so shall it be at the end of the age.
Matthew	Mat	40	13	41	"The Son of Man will send forth His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all stumbling blocks, and those who commit lawlessness,
Matthew	Mat	40	13	42	and will throw them into the furnace of fire; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Matthew	Mat	40	13	43	"Then THE RIGHTEOUS WILL SHINE FORTH AS THE SUN in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.
Matthew	Mat	40	13	44	"The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid again; and from joy over it he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.
Matthew	Mat	40	13	45	"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking fine pearls,
Matthew	Mat	40	13	46	and upon finding one pearl of great value, he went and sold all that he had and bought it.
Matthew	Mat	40	13	47	"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet cast into the sea, and gathering fish of every kind;
Matthew	Mat	40	13	48	and when it was filled, they drew it up on the beach; and they sat down and gathered the good fish into containers, but the bad they threw away.
Matthew	Mat	40	13	49	"So it will be at the end of the age; the angels will come forth and take out the wicked from among the righteous,
Matthew	Mat	40	13	50	and will throw them into the furnace of fire; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Matthew	Mat	40	13	51	"Have you understood all these things?" They *said to Him, "Yes."
Matthew	Mat	40	13	52	And Jesus said to them, "Therefore every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like a head of a household, who brings out of his treasure things new and old."
Matthew	Mat	40	13	53	When Jesus had finished these parables, He departed from there.
Matthew	Mat	40	13	54	He came to His hometown and began teaching them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, "Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?
Matthew	Mat	40	13	55	"Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not His mother called Mary, and His brothers, James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
Matthew	Mat	40	13	56	"And His sisters, are they not all with us? Where then did this man get all these things?"
Matthew	Mat	40	13	57	And they took offense at Him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own household."
Matthew	Mat	40	13	58	And He did not do many miracles there because of their unbelief.
Matthew	Mat	40	14	1	At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the news about Jesus,
Matthew	Mat	40	14	2	and said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him."
Matthew	Mat	40	14	3	For when Herod had John arrested, he bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip.
Matthew	Mat	40	14	4	For John had been saying to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her."
Matthew	Mat	40	14	5	Although Herod wanted to put him to death, he feared the crowd, because they regarded John as a prophet.
Matthew	Mat	40	14	6	But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod,
Matthew	Mat	40	14	7	so much that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.
Matthew	Mat	40	14	8	Having been prompted by her mother, she *said, "Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist."
Matthew	Mat	40	14	9	Although he was grieved, the king commanded it to be given because of his oaths, and because of his dinner guests.
Matthew	Mat	40	14	10	He sent and had John beheaded in the prison.
Matthew	Mat	40	14	11	And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.
Matthew	Mat	40	14	12	His disciples came and took away the body and buried it; and they went and reported to Jesus.
Matthew	Mat	40	14	13	Now when Jesus heard about John, He withdrew from there in a boat to a secluded place by Himself; and when the people heard of this, they followed Him on foot from the cities.
Matthew	Mat	40	14	14	When He went ashore, He saw a large crowd, and felt compassion for them and healed their sick.
Matthew	Mat	40	14	15	When it was evening, the disciples came to Him and said, "This place is desolate and the hour is already late; so send the crowds away, that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves."
Matthew	Mat	40	14	16	But Jesus said to them, "They do not need to go away; you give them something to eat!"
Matthew	Mat	40	14	17	They *said to Him, "We have here only five loaves and two fish."
Matthew	Mat	40	14	18	And He said, "Bring them here to Me."
Matthew	Mat	40	14	19	Ordering the people to sit down on the grass, He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up toward heaven, He blessed the food, and breaking the loaves He gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds,
Matthew	Mat	40	14	20	and they all ate and were satisfied. They picked up what was left over of the broken pieces, twelve full baskets.
Matthew	Mat	40	14	21	There were about five thousand men who ate, besides women and children.
Matthew	Mat	40	14	22	Immediately He made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side, while He sent the crowds away.
Matthew	Mat	40	14	23	After He had sent the crowds away, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray; and when it was evening, He was there alone.
Matthew	Mat	40	14	24	But the boat was already a long distance from the land, battered by the waves; for the wind was contrary.
Matthew	Mat	40	14	25	And in the fourth watch of the night He came to them, walking on the sea.
Matthew	Mat	40	14	26	When the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were terrified, and said, "It is a ghost!" And they cried out in fear.
Matthew	Mat	40	14	27	But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, "Take courage, it is I; do not be afraid."
Matthew	Mat	40	14	28	Peter said to Him, "Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water."
Matthew	Mat	40	14	29	And He said, "Come!" And Peter got out of the boat, and walked on the water and came toward Jesus.
Matthew	Mat	40	14	30	But seeing the wind, he became frightened, and beginning to sink, he cried out, "Lord, save me!"
Matthew	Mat	40	14	31	Immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and took hold of him, and *said to him, "You of little faith, why did you doubt?"
Matthew	Mat	40	14	32	When they got into the boat, the wind stopped.
Matthew	Mat	40	14	33	And those who were in the boat worshiped Him, saying, "You are certainly God's Son!"
Matthew	Mat	40	14	34	When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret.
Matthew	Mat	40	14	35	And when the men of that place recognized Him, they sent word into all that surrounding district and brought to Him all who were sick;
Matthew	Mat	40	14	36	and they implored Him that they might just touch the fringe of His cloak; and as many as touched it were cured.
Matthew	Mat	40	15	1	Then some Pharisees and scribes *came to Jesus from Jerusalem and said,
Matthew	Mat	40	15	2	"Why do Your disciples break the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread."
Matthew	Mat	40	15	3	And He answered and said to them, "Why do you yourselves transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?
Matthew	Mat	40	15	4	"For God said, 'HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER,' and, 'HE WHO SPEAKS EVIL OF FATHER OR MOTHER IS TO BE PUT TO DEATH.'
Matthew	Mat	40	15	5	"But you say, 'Whoever says to his father or mother, "Whatever I have that would help you has been given to God,"
Matthew	Mat	40	15	6	he is not to honor his father or his mother.' And by this you invalidated the word of God for the sake of your tradition.
Matthew	Mat	40	15	7	"You hypocrites, rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you:
Matthew	Mat	40	15	8	'THIS PEOPLE HONORS ME WITH THEIR LIPS, BUT THEIR HEART IS FAR AWAY FROM ME.
Matthew	Mat	40	15	9	'BUT IN VAIN DO THEY WORSHIP ME, TEACHING AS DOCTRINES THE PRECEPTS OF MEN.'"
Matthew	Mat	40	15	10	After Jesus called the crowd to Him, He said to them, "Hear and understand.
Matthew	Mat	40	15	11	"It is not what enters into the mouth that defiles the man, but what proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man."
Matthew	Mat	40	15	12	Then the disciples *came and *said to Him, "Do You know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this statement?"
Matthew	Mat	40	15	13	But He answered and said, "Every plant which My heavenly Father did not plant shall be uprooted.
Matthew	Mat	40	15	14	"Let them alone; they are blind guides of the blind. And if a blind man guides a blind man, both will fall into a pit."
Matthew	Mat	40	15	15	Peter said to Him, "Explain the parable to us."
Matthew	Mat	40	15	16	Jesus said, "Are you still lacking in understanding also?
Matthew	Mat	40	15	17	"Do you not understand that everything that goes into the mouth passes into the stomach, and is eliminated?
Matthew	Mat	40	15	18	"But the things that proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and those defile the man.
Matthew	Mat	40	15	19	"For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, slanders.
Matthew	Mat	40	15	20	"These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the man."
Matthew	Mat	40	15	21	Jesus went away from there, and withdrew into the district of Tyre and Sidon.
Matthew	Mat	40	15	22	And a Canaanite woman from that region came out and began to cry out, saying, "Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David; my daughter is cruelly demon-possessed."
Matthew	Mat	40	15	23	But He did not answer her a word. And His disciples came and implored Him, saying, "Send her away, because she keeps shouting at us."
Matthew	Mat	40	15	24	But He answered and said, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
Matthew	Mat	40	15	25	But she came and began to bow down before Him, saying, "Lord, help me!"
Matthew	Mat	40	15	26	And He answered and said, "It is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
Matthew	Mat	40	15	27	But she said, "Yes, Lord; but even the dogs feed on the crumbs which fall from their masters' table."
Matthew	Mat	40	15	28	Then Jesus said to her, "O woman, your faith is great; it shall be done for you as you wish." And her daughter was healed at once.
Matthew	Mat	40	15	29	Departing from there, Jesus went along by the Sea of Galilee, and having gone up on the mountain, He was sitting there.
Matthew	Mat	40	15	30	And large crowds came to Him, bringing with them those who were lame, crippled, blind, mute, and many others, and they laid them down at His feet; and He healed them.
Matthew	Mat	40	15	31	So the crowd marveled as they saw the mute speaking, the crippled restored, and the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.
Matthew	Mat	40	15	32	And Jesus called His disciples to Him, and said, "I feel compassion for the people, because they have remained with Me now three days and have nothing to eat; and I do not want to send them away hungry, for they might faint on the way."
Matthew	Mat	40	15	33	The disciples *said to Him, "Where would we get so many loaves in this desolate place to satisfy such a large crowd?"
Matthew	Mat	40	15	34	And Jesus *said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" And they said, "Seven, and a few small fish."
Matthew	Mat	40	15	35	And He directed the people to sit down on the ground;
Matthew	Mat	40	15	36	and He took the seven loaves and the fish; and giving thanks, He broke them and started giving them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
Matthew	Mat	40	15	37	And they all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up what was left over of the broken pieces, seven large baskets full.
Matthew	Mat	40	15	38	And those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.
Matthew	Mat	40	15	39	And sending away the crowds, Jesus got into the boat and came to the region of Magadan.
Matthew	Mat	40	16	1	The Pharisees and Sadducees came up, and testing Jesus, they asked Him to show them a sign from heaven.
Matthew	Mat	40	16	2	But He replied to them, "When it is evening, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.'
Matthew	Mat	40	16	3	"And in the morning, 'There will be a storm today, for the sky is red and threatening.' Do you know how to discern the appearance of the sky, but cannot discern the signs of the times?
Matthew	Mat	40	16	4	"An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and a sign will not be given it, except the sign of Jonah." And He left them and went away.
Matthew	Mat	40	16	5	And the disciples came to the other side of the sea, but they had forgotten to bring any bread.
Matthew	Mat	40	16	6	And Jesus said to them, "Watch out and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
Matthew	Mat	40	16	7	They began to discuss this among themselves, saying, "He said that because we did not bring any bread."
Matthew	Mat	40	16	8	But Jesus, aware of this, said, "You men of little faith, why do you discuss among yourselves that you have no bread?
Matthew	Mat	40	16	9	"Do you not yet understand or remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets full you picked up?
Matthew	Mat	40	16	10	"Or the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many large baskets full you picked up?
Matthew	Mat	40	16	11	"How is it that you do not understand that I did not speak to you concerning bread? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
Matthew	Mat	40	16	12	Then they understood that He did not say to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Matthew	Mat	40	16	13	Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, He was asking His disciples, "Who do people say that the Son of Man is?"
Matthew	Mat	40	16	14	And they said, "Some say John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; but still others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets."
Matthew	Mat	40	16	15	He *said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"
Matthew	Mat	40	16	16	Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Matthew	Mat	40	16	17	And Jesus said to him, "Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but My Father who is in heaven.
Matthew	Mat	40	16	18	"I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church; and the gates of Hades will not overpower it.
Matthew	Mat	40	16	19	"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall have been loosed in heaven."
Matthew	Mat	40	16	20	Then He warned the disciples that they should tell no one that He was the Christ.
Matthew	Mat	40	16	21	From that time Jesus began to show His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised up on the third day.
Matthew	Mat	40	16	22	Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, "God forbid it, Lord! This shall never happen to You."
Matthew	Mat	40	16	23	But He turned and said to Peter, "Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me; for you are not setting your mind on God's interests, but man's."
Matthew	Mat	40	16	24	Then Jesus said to His disciples, "If anyone wishes to come after Me, he must deny himself, and take up his cross and follow Me.
Matthew	Mat	40	16	25	"For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it; but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it.
Matthew	Mat	40	16	26	"For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?
Matthew	Mat	40	16	27	"For the Son of Man is going to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and WILL THEN REPAY EVERY MAN ACCORDING TO HIS DEEDS.
Matthew	Mat	40	16	28	"Truly I say to you, there are some of those who are standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom."
Matthew	Mat	40	17	1	Six days later Jesus *took with Him Peter and James and John his brother, and *led them up on a high mountain by themselves.
Matthew	Mat	40	17	2	And He was transfigured before them; and His face shone like the sun, and His garments became as white as light.
Matthew	Mat	40	17	3	And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Him.
Matthew	Mat	40	17	4	Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You wish, I will make three tabernacles here, one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
Matthew	Mat	40	17	5	While he was still speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice out of the cloud said, "This is My beloved Son, with whom I am well-pleased; listen to Him!"
Matthew	Mat	40	17	6	When the disciples heard this, they fell face down to the ground and were terrified.
Matthew	Mat	40	17	7	And Jesus came to them and touched them and said, "Get up, and do not be afraid."
Matthew	Mat	40	17	8	And lifting up their eyes, they saw no one except Jesus Himself alone.
Matthew	Mat	40	17	9	As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, "Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
Matthew	Mat	40	17	10	And His disciples asked Him, "Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
Matthew	Mat	40	17	11	And He answered and said, "Elijah is coming and will restore all things;
Matthew	Mat	40	17	12	but I say to you that Elijah already came, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they wished. So also the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands."
Matthew	Mat	40	17	13	Then the disciples understood that He had spoken to them about John the Baptist.
Matthew	Mat	40	17	14	When they came to the crowd, a man came up to Jesus, falling on his knees before Him and saying,
Matthew	Mat	40	17	15	"Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is a lunatic and is very ill; for he often falls into the fire and often into the water.
Matthew	Mat	40	17	16	"I brought him to Your disciples, and they could not cure him."
Matthew	Mat	40	17	17	And Jesus answered and said, "You unbelieving and perverted generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring him here to Me."
Matthew	Mat	40	17	18	And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon came out of him, and the boy was cured at once.
Matthew	Mat	40	17	19	Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, "Why could we not drive it out?"
Matthew	Mat	40	17	20	And He *said to them, "Because of the littleness of your faith; for truly I say to you, if you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you.
Matthew	Mat	40	17	21	["But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting."]
Matthew	Mat	40	17	22	And while they were gathering together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men;
Matthew	Mat	40	17	23	and they will kill Him, and He will be raised on the third day." And they were deeply grieved.
Matthew	Mat	40	17	24	When they came to Capernaum, those who collected the two-drachma tax came to Peter and said, "Does your teacher not pay the two-drachma tax?"
Matthew	Mat	40	17	25	He *said, "Yes." And when he came into the house, Jesus spoke to him first, saying, "What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth collect customs or poll-tax, from their sons or from strangers?"
Matthew	Mat	40	17	26	When Peter said, "From strangers," Jesus said to him, "Then the sons are exempt.
Matthew	Mat	40	17	27	"However, so that we do not offend them, go to the sea and throw in a hook, and take the first fish that comes up; and when you open its mouth, you will find a shekel. Take that and give it to them for you and Me."
Matthew	Mat	40	18	1	At that time the disciples came to Jesus and said, "Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
Matthew	Mat	40	18	2	And He called a child to Himself and set him before them,
Matthew	Mat	40	18	3	and said, "Truly I say to you, unless you are converted and become like children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew	Mat	40	18	4	"Whoever then humbles himself as this child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew	Mat	40	18	5	"And whoever receives one such child in My name receives Me;
Matthew	Mat	40	18	6	but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a heavy millstone hung around his neck, and to be drowned in the depth of the sea.
Matthew	Mat	40	18	7	"Woe to the world because of its stumbling blocks! For it is inevitable that stumbling blocks come; but woe to that man through whom the stumbling block comes!
Matthew	Mat	40	18	8	"If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it from you; it is better for you to enter life crippled or lame, than to have two hands or two feet and be cast into the eternal fire.
Matthew	Mat	40	18	9	"If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it from you. It is better for you to enter life with one eye, than to have two eyes and be cast into the fiery hell.
Matthew	Mat	40	18	10	"See that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that their angels in heaven continually see the face of My Father who is in heaven.
Matthew	Mat	40	18	11	["For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost.]
Matthew	Mat	40	18	12	"What do you think? If any man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go and search for the one that is straying?
Matthew	Mat	40	18	13	"If it turns out that he finds it, truly I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray.
Matthew	Mat	40	18	14	"So it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones perish.
Matthew	Mat	40	18	15	"If your brother sins, go and show him his fault in private; if he listens to you, you have won your brother.
Matthew	Mat	40	18	16	"But if he does not listen to you, take one or two more with you, so that BY THE MOUTH OF TWO OR THREE WITNESSES EVERY FACT MAY BE CONFIRMED.
Matthew	Mat	40	18	17	"If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.
Matthew	Mat	40	18	18	"Truly I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth shall have been loosed in heaven.
Matthew	Mat	40	18	19	"Again I say to you, that if two of you agree on earth about anything that they may ask, it shall be done for them by My Father who is in heaven.
Matthew	Mat	40	18	20	"For where two or three have gathered together in My name, I am there in their midst."
Matthew	Mat	40	18	21	Then Peter came and said to Him, "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Up to seven times?"
Matthew	Mat	40	18	22	Jesus *said to him, "I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven.
Matthew	Mat	40	18	23	"For this reason the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves.
Matthew	Mat	40	18	24	"When he had begun to settle them, one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him.
Matthew	Mat	40	18	25	"But since he did not have the means to repay, his lord commanded him to be sold, along with his wife and children and all that he had, and repayment to be made.
Matthew	Mat	40	18	26	"So the slave fell to the ground and prostrated himself before him, saying, 'Have patience with me and I will repay you everything.'
Matthew	Mat	40	18	27	"And the lord of that slave felt compassion and released him and forgave him the debt.
Matthew	Mat	40	18	28	"But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii; and he seized him and began to choke him, saying, 'Pay back what you owe.'
Matthew	Mat	40	18	29	"So his fellow slave fell to the ground and began to plead with him, saying, 'Have patience with me and I will repay you.'
Matthew	Mat	40	18	30	"But he was unwilling and went and threw him in prison until he should pay back what was owed.
Matthew	Mat	40	18	31	"So when his fellow slaves saw what had happened, they were deeply grieved and came and reported to their lord all that had happened.
Matthew	Mat	40	18	32	"Then summoning him, his lord *said to him, 'You wicked slave, I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me.
Matthew	Mat	40	18	33	'Should you not also have had mercy on your fellow slave, in the same way that I had mercy on you?'
Matthew	Mat	40	18	34	"And his lord, moved with anger, handed him over to the torturers until he should repay all that was owed him.
Matthew	Mat	40	18	35	"My heavenly Father will also do the same to you, if each of you does not forgive his brother from your heart."
Matthew	Mat	40	19	1	When Jesus had finished these words, He departed from Galilee and came into the region of Judea beyond the Jordan;
Matthew	Mat	40	19	2	and large crowds followed Him, and He healed them there.
Matthew	Mat	40	19	3	Some Pharisees came to Jesus, testing Him and asking, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason at all?"
Matthew	Mat	40	19	4	And He answered and said, "Have you not read that He who created them from the beginning MADE THEM MALE AND FEMALE,
Matthew	Mat	40	19	5	and said, 'FOR THIS REASON A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND BE JOINED TO HIS WIFE, AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH'?
Matthew	Mat	40	19	6	"So they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate."
Matthew	Mat	40	19	7	They *said to Him, "Why then did Moses command to GIVE HER A CERTIFICATE OF DIVORCE AND SEND her AWAY?"
Matthew	Mat	40	19	8	He *said to them, "Because of your hardness of heart Moses permitted you to divorce your wives; but from the beginning it has not been this way.
Matthew	Mat	40	19	9	"And I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery."
Matthew	Mat	40	19	10	The disciples *said to Him, "If the relationship of the man with his wife is like this, it is better not to marry."
Matthew	Mat	40	19	11	But He said to them, "Not all men can accept this statement, but only those to whom it has been given.
Matthew	Mat	40	19	12	"For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother's womb; and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are also eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to accept this, let him accept it."
Matthew	Mat	40	19	13	Then some children were brought to Him so that He might lay His hands on them and pray; and the disciples rebuked them.
Matthew	Mat	40	19	14	But Jesus said, "Let the children alone, and do not hinder them from coming to Me; for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
Matthew	Mat	40	19	15	After laying His hands on them, He departed from there.
Matthew	Mat	40	19	16	And someone came to Him and said, "Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may obtain eternal life?"
Matthew	Mat	40	19	17	And He said to him, "Why are you asking Me about what is good? There is only One who is good; but if you wish to enter into life, keep the commandments."
Matthew	Mat	40	19	18	Then he *said to Him, "Which ones?" And Jesus said, "YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT MURDER; YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY; YOU SHALL NOT STEAL; YOU SHALL NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS;
Matthew	Mat	40	19	19	HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER; and YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF."
Matthew	Mat	40	19	20	The young man *said to Him, "All these things I have kept; what am I still lacking?"
Matthew	Mat	40	19	21	Jesus said to him, "If you wish to be complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me."
Matthew	Mat	40	19	22	But when the young man heard this statement, he went away grieving; for he was one who owned much property.
Matthew	Mat	40	19	23	And Jesus said to His disciples, "Truly I say to you, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew	Mat	40	19	24	"Again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."
Matthew	Mat	40	19	25	When the disciples heard this, they were very astonished and said, "Then who can be saved?"
Matthew	Mat	40	19	26	And looking at them Jesus said to them, "With people this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Matthew	Mat	40	19	27	Then Peter said to Him, "Behold, we have left everything and followed You; what then will there be for us?"
Matthew	Mat	40	19	28	And Jesus said to them, "Truly I say to you, that you who have followed Me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on His glorious throne, you also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
Matthew	Mat	40	19	29	"And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or farms for My name's sake, will receive many times as much, and will inherit eternal life.
Matthew	Mat	40	19	30	"But many who are first will be last; and the last, first.
Matthew	Mat	40	20	1	"For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
Matthew	Mat	40	20	2	"When he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius for the day, he sent them into his vineyard.
Matthew	Mat	40	20	3	"And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the market place;
Matthew	Mat	40	20	4	and to those he said, 'You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.' And so they went.
Matthew	Mat	40	20	5	"Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did the same thing.
Matthew	Mat	40	20	6	"And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing around; and he *said to them, 'Why have you been standing here idle all day long?'
Matthew	Mat	40	20	7	"They *said to him, 'Because no one hired us.' He *said to them, 'You go into the vineyard too.'
Matthew	Mat	40	20	8	"When evening came, the owner of the vineyard *said to his foreman, 'Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last group to the first.'
Matthew	Mat	40	20	9	"When those hired about the eleventh hour came, each one received a denarius.
Matthew	Mat	40	20	10	"When those hired first came, they thought that they would receive more; but each of them also received a denarius.
Matthew	Mat	40	20	11	"When they received it, they grumbled at the landowner,
Matthew	Mat	40	20	12	saying, 'These last men have worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the scorching heat of the day.'
Matthew	Mat	40	20	13	"But he answered and said to one of them, 'Friend, I am doing you no wrong; did you not agree with me for a denarius?
Matthew	Mat	40	20	14	'Take what is yours and go, but I wish to give to this last man the same as to you.
Matthew	Mat	40	20	15	'Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with what is my own? Or is your eye envious because I am generous?'
Matthew	Mat	40	20	16	"So the last shall be first, and the first last."
Matthew	Mat	40	20	17	As Jesus was about to go up to Jerusalem, He took the twelve disciples aside by themselves, and on the way He said to them,
Matthew	Mat	40	20	18	"Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem; and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn Him to death,
Matthew	Mat	40	20	19	and will hand Him over to the Gentiles to mock and scourge and crucify Him, and on the third day He will be raised up."
Matthew	Mat	40	20	20	Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Jesus with her sons, bowing down and making a request of Him.
Matthew	Mat	40	20	21	And He said to her, "What do you wish?" She *said to Him, "Command that in Your kingdom these two sons of mine may sit one on Your right and one on Your left."
Matthew	Mat	40	20	22	But Jesus answered, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?" They *said to Him, "We are able."
Matthew	Mat	40	20	23	He *said to them, "My cup you shall drink; but to sit on My right and on My left, this is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by My Father."
Matthew	Mat	40	20	24	And hearing this, the ten became indignant with the two brothers.
Matthew	Mat	40	20	25	But Jesus called them to Himself and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over them.
Matthew	Mat	40	20	26	"It is not this way among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant,
Matthew	Mat	40	20	27	and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your slave;
Matthew	Mat	40	20	28	just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many."
Matthew	Mat	40	20	29	As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed Him.
Matthew	Mat	40	20	30	And two blind men sitting by the road, hearing that Jesus was passing by, cried out, "Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!"
Matthew	Mat	40	20	31	The crowd sternly told them to be quiet, but they cried out all the more, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"
Matthew	Mat	40	20	32	And Jesus stopped and called them, and said, "What do you want Me to do for you?"
Matthew	Mat	40	20	33	They *said to Him, "Lord, we want our eyes to be opened."
Matthew	Mat	40	20	34	Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes; and immediately they regained their sight and followed Him.
Matthew	Mat	40	21	1	When they had approached Jerusalem and had come to Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
Matthew	Mat	40	21	2	saying to them, "Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied there and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to Me.
Matthew	Mat	40	21	3	"If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, 'The Lord has need of them,' and immediately he will send them."
Matthew	Mat	40	21	4	This took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet:
Matthew	Mat	40	21	5	"SAY TO THE DAUGHTER OF ZION, 'BEHOLD YOUR KING IS COMING TO YOU, GENTLE, AND MOUNTED ON A DONKEY, EVEN ON A COLT, THE FOAL OF A BEAST OF BURDEN.'"
Matthew	Mat	40	21	6	The disciples went and did just as Jesus had instructed them,
Matthew	Mat	40	21	7	and brought the donkey and the colt, and laid their coats on them; and He sat on the coats.
Matthew	Mat	40	21	8	Most of the crowd spread their coats in the road, and others were cutting branches from the trees and spreading them in the road.
Matthew	Mat	40	21	9	The crowds going ahead of Him, and those who followed, were shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David; BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD; Hosanna in the highest!"
Matthew	Mat	40	21	10	When He had entered Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying, "Who is this?"
Matthew	Mat	40	21	11	And the crowds were saying, "This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth in Galilee."
Matthew	Mat	40	21	12	And Jesus entered the temple and drove out all those who were buying and selling in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling doves.
Matthew	Mat	40	21	13	And He *said to them, "It is written, 'MY HOUSE SHALL BE CALLED A HOUSE OF PRAYER'; but you are making it a ROBBERS' DEN."
Matthew	Mat	40	21	14	And the blind and the lame came to Him in the temple, and He healed them.
Matthew	Mat	40	21	15	But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that He had done, and the children who were shouting in the temple, "Hosanna to the Son of David," they became indignant
Matthew	Mat	40	21	16	and said to Him, "Do You hear what these children are saying?" And Jesus *said to them, "Yes; have you never read, 'OUT OF THE MOUTH OF INFANTS AND NURSING BABIES YOU HAVE PREPARED PRAISE FOR YOURSELF'?"
Matthew	Mat	40	21	17	And He left them and went out of the city to Bethany, and spent the night there.
Matthew	Mat	40	21	18	Now in the morning, when He was returning to the city, He became hungry.
Matthew	Mat	40	21	19	Seeing a lone fig tree by the road, He came to it and found nothing on it except leaves only; and He *said to it, "No longer shall there ever be any fruit from you." And at once the fig tree withered.
Matthew	Mat	40	21	20	Seeing this, the disciples were amazed and asked, "How did the fig tree wither all at once?"
Matthew	Mat	40	21	21	And Jesus answered and said to them, "Truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' it will happen.
Matthew	Mat	40	21	22	"And all things you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive."
Matthew	Mat	40	21	23	When He entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to Him while He was teaching, and said, "By what authority are You doing these things, and who gave You this authority?"
Matthew	Mat	40	21	24	Jesus said to them, "I will also ask you one thing, which if you tell Me, I will also tell you by what authority I do these things.
Matthew	Mat	40	21	25	"The baptism of John was from what source, from heaven or from men?" And they began reasoning among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' He will say to us, 'Then why did you not believe him?'
Matthew	Mat	40	21	26	"But if we say, 'From men,' we fear the people; for they all regard John as a prophet."
Matthew	Mat	40	21	27	And answering Jesus, they said, "We do not know." He also said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.
Matthew	Mat	40	21	28	"But what do you think? A man had two sons, and he came to the first and said, 'Son, go work today in the vineyard.'
Matthew	Mat	40	21	29	"And he answered, 'I will not'; but afterward he regretted it and went.
Matthew	Mat	40	21	30	"The man came to the second and said the same thing; and he answered, 'I will, sir'; but he did not go.
Matthew	Mat	40	21	31	"Which of the two did the will of his father?" They *said, "The first." Jesus *said to them, "Truly I say to you that the tax collectors and prostitutes will get into the kingdom of God before you.
Matthew	Mat	40	21	32	"For John came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him; but the tax collectors and prostitutes did believe him; and you, seeing this, did not even feel remorse afterward so as to believe him.
Matthew	Mat	40	21	33	"Listen to another parable. There was a landowner who PLANTED A VINEYARD AND PUT A WALL AROUND IT AND DUG A WINE PRESS IN IT, AND BUILT A TOWER, and rented it out to vine-growers and went on a journey.
Matthew	Mat	40	21	34	"When the harvest time approached, he sent his slaves to the vine-growers to receive his produce.
Matthew	Mat	40	21	35	"The vine-growers took his slaves and beat one, and killed another, and stoned a third.
Matthew	Mat	40	21	36	"Again he sent another group of slaves larger than the first; and they did the same thing to them.
Matthew	Mat	40	21	37	"But afterward he sent his son to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.'
Matthew	Mat	40	21	38	"But when the vine-growers saw the son, they said among themselves, 'This is the heir; come, let us kill him and seize his inheritance.'
Matthew	Mat	40	21	39	"They took him, and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.
Matthew	Mat	40	21	40	"Therefore when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vine-growers?"
Matthew	Mat	40	21	41	They *said to Him, "He will bring those wretches to a wretched end, and will rent out the vineyard to other vine-growers who will pay him the proceeds at the proper seasons."
Matthew	Mat	40	21	42	Jesus *said to them, "Did you never read in the Scriptures, 'THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED, THIS BECAME THE CHIEF CORNER stone; THIS CAME ABOUT FROM THE LORD, AND IT IS MARVELOUS IN OUR EYES'?
Matthew	Mat	40	21	43	"Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people, producing the fruit of it.
Matthew	Mat	40	21	44	"And he who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls, it will scatter him like dust."
Matthew	Mat	40	21	45	When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard His parables, they understood that He was speaking about them.
Matthew	Mat	40	21	46	When they sought to seize Him, they feared the people, because they considered Him to be a prophet.
Matthew	Mat	40	22	1	Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying,
Matthew	Mat	40	22	2	"The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son.
Matthew	Mat	40	22	3	"And he sent out his slaves to call those who had been invited to the wedding feast, and they were unwilling to come.
Matthew	Mat	40	22	4	"Again he sent out other slaves saying, 'Tell those who have been invited, "Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fattened livestock are all butchered and everything is ready; come to the wedding feast."'
Matthew	Mat	40	22	5	"But they paid no attention and went their way, one to his own farm, another to his business,
Matthew	Mat	40	22	6	and the rest seized his slaves and mistreated them and killed them.
Matthew	Mat	40	22	7	"But the king was enraged, and he sent his armies and destroyed those murderers and set their city on fire.
Matthew	Mat	40	22	8	"Then he *said to his slaves, 'The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.
Matthew	Mat	40	22	9	'Go therefore to the main highways, and as many as you find there, invite to the wedding feast.'
Matthew	Mat	40	22	10	"Those slaves went out into the streets and gathered together all they found, both evil and good; and the wedding hall was filled with dinner guests.
Matthew	Mat	40	22	11	"But when the king came in to look over the dinner guests, he saw a man there who was not dressed in wedding clothes,
Matthew	Mat	40	22	12	and he *said to him, 'Friend, how did you come in here without wedding clothes?' And the man was speechless.
Matthew	Mat	40	22	13	"Then the king said to the servants, 'Bind him hand and foot, and throw him into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'
Matthew	Mat	40	22	14	"For many are called, but few are chosen."
Matthew	Mat	40	22	15	Then the Pharisees went and plotted together how they might trap Him in what He said.
Matthew	Mat	40	22	16	And they *sent their disciples to Him, along with the Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know that You are truthful and teach the way of God in truth, and defer to no one; for You are not partial to any.
Matthew	Mat	40	22	17	"Tell us then, what do You think? Is it lawful to give a poll-tax to Caesar, or not?"
Matthew	Mat	40	22	18	But Jesus perceived their malice, and said, "Why are you testing Me, you hypocrites?
Matthew	Mat	40	22	19	"Show Me the coin used for the poll-tax." And they brought Him a denarius.
Matthew	Mat	40	22	20	And He *said to them, "Whose likeness and inscription is this?"
Matthew	Mat	40	22	21	They *said to Him, "Caesar's." Then He *said to them, "Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and to God the things that are God's."
Matthew	Mat	40	22	22	And hearing this, they were amazed, and leaving Him, they went away.
Matthew	Mat	40	22	23	On that day some Sadducees (who say there is no resurrection) came to Jesus and questioned Him,
Matthew	Mat	40	22	24	asking, "Teacher, Moses said, 'IF A MAN DIES HAVING NO CHILDREN, HIS BROTHER AS NEXT OF KIN SHALL MARRY HIS WIFE, AND RAISE UP CHILDREN FOR HIS BROTHER.'
Matthew	Mat	40	22	25	"Now there were seven brothers with us; and the first married and died, and having no children left his wife to his brother;
Matthew	Mat	40	22	26	so also the second, and the third, down to the seventh.
Matthew	Mat	40	22	27	"Last of all, the woman died.
Matthew	Mat	40	22	28	"In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had married her."
Matthew	Mat	40	22	29	But Jesus answered and said to them, "You are mistaken, not understanding the Scriptures nor the power of God.
Matthew	Mat	40	22	30	"For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.
Matthew	Mat	40	22	31	"But regarding the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God:
Matthew	Mat	40	22	32	'I AM THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, AND THE GOD OF ISAAC, AND THE GOD OF JACOB'? He is not the God of the dead but of the living."
Matthew	Mat	40	22	33	When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at His teaching.
Matthew	Mat	40	22	34	But when the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered themselves together.
Matthew	Mat	40	22	35	One of them, a lawyer, asked Him a question, testing Him,
Matthew	Mat	40	22	36	"Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?"
Matthew	Mat	40	22	37	And He said to him, " 'YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND.'
Matthew	Mat	40	22	38	"This is the great and foremost commandment.
Matthew	Mat	40	22	39	"The second is like it, 'YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.'
Matthew	Mat	40	22	40	"On these two commandments depend the whole Law and the Prophets."
Matthew	Mat	40	22	41	Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question:
Matthew	Mat	40	22	42	"What do you think about the Christ, whose son is He?" They *said to Him, "The son of David."
Matthew	Mat	40	22	43	He *said to them, "Then how does David in the Spirit call Him 'Lord,' saying,
Matthew	Mat	40	22	44	'THE LORD SAID TO MY LORD, "SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND, UNTIL I PUT YOUR ENEMIES BENEATH YOUR FEET"'?
Matthew	Mat	40	22	45	"If David then calls Him 'Lord,' how is He his son?"
Matthew	Mat	40	22	46	No one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone dare from that day on to ask Him another question.
Matthew	Mat	40	23	1	Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to His disciples,
Matthew	Mat	40	23	2	saying: "The scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in the chair of Moses;
Matthew	Mat	40	23	3	therefore all that they tell you, do and observe, but do not do according to their deeds; for they say things and do not do them.
Matthew	Mat	40	23	4	"They tie up heavy burdens and lay them on men's shoulders, but they themselves are unwilling to move them with so much as a finger.
Matthew	Mat	40	23	5	"But they do all their deeds to be noticed by men; for they broaden their phylacteries and lengthen the tassels of their garments.
Matthew	Mat	40	23	6	"They love the place of honor at banquets and the chief seats in the synagogues,
Matthew	Mat	40	23	7	and respectful greetings in the market places, and being called Rabbi by men.
Matthew	Mat	40	23	8	"But do not be called Rabbi; for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers.
Matthew	Mat	40	23	9	"Do not call anyone on earth your father; for One is your Father, He who is in heaven.
Matthew	Mat	40	23	10	"Do not be called leaders; for One is your Leader, that is, Christ.
Matthew	Mat	40	23	11	"But the greatest among you shall be your servant.
Matthew	Mat	40	23	12	"Whoever exalts himself shall be humbled; and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted.
Matthew	Mat	40	23	13	"But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you shut off the kingdom of heaven from people; for you do not enter in yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in.
Matthew	Mat	40	23	14	["Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you devour widows' houses, and for a pretense you make long prayers; therefore you will receive greater condemnation.]
Matthew	Mat	40	23	15	"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you travel around on sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves.
Matthew	Mat	40	23	16	"Woe to you, blind guides, who say, 'Whoever swears by the temple, that is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple is obligated.'
Matthew	Mat	40	23	17	"You fools and blind men! Which is more important, the gold or the temple that sanctified the gold?
Matthew	Mat	40	23	18	"And, 'Whoever swears by the altar, that is nothing, but whoever swears by the offering on it, he is obligated.'
Matthew	Mat	40	23	19	"You blind men, which is more important, the offering, or the altar that sanctifies the offering?
Matthew	Mat	40	23	20	"Therefore, whoever swears by the altar, swears both by the altar and by everything on it.
Matthew	Mat	40	23	21	"And whoever swears by the temple, swears both by the temple and by Him who dwells within it.
Matthew	Mat	40	23	22	"And whoever swears by heaven, swears both by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it.
Matthew	Mat	40	23	23	"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cummin, and have neglected the weightier provisions of the law: justice and mercy and faithfulness; but these are the things you should have done without neglecting the others.
Matthew	Mat	40	23	24	"You blind guides, who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel!
Matthew	Mat	40	23	25	"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside they are full of robbery and self-indulgence.
Matthew	Mat	40	23	26	"You blind Pharisee, first clean the inside of the cup and of the dish, so that the outside of it may become clean also.
Matthew	Mat	40	23	27	"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs which on the outside appear beautiful, but inside they are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness.
Matthew	Mat	40	23	28	"So you, too, outwardly appear righteous to men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
Matthew	Mat	40	23	29	"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous,
Matthew	Mat	40	23	30	and say, 'If we had been living in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partners with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.'
Matthew	Mat	40	23	31	"So you testify against yourselves, that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets.
Matthew	Mat	40	23	32	"Fill up, then, the measure of the guilt of your fathers.
Matthew	Mat	40	23	33	"You serpents, you brood of vipers, how will you escape the sentence of hell?
Matthew	Mat	40	23	34	"Therefore, behold, I am sending you prophets and wise men and scribes; some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city,
Matthew	Mat	40	23	35	so that upon you may fall the guilt of all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
Matthew	Mat	40	23	36	"Truly I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation.
Matthew	Mat	40	23	37	"Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were unwilling.
Matthew	Mat	40	23	38	"Behold, your house is being left to you desolate!
Matthew	Mat	40	23	39	"For I say to you, from now on you will not see Me until you say, 'BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD!'"
Matthew	Mat	40	24	1	Jesus came out from the temple and was going away when His disciples came up to point out the temple buildings to Him.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	2	And He said to them, "Do you not see all these things? Truly I say to you, not one stone here will be left upon another, which will not be torn down."
Matthew	Mat	40	24	3	As He was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, "Tell us, when will these things happen, and what will be the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?"
Matthew	Mat	40	24	4	And Jesus answered and said to them, "See to it that no one misleads you.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	5	"For many will come in My name, saying, 'I am the Christ,' and will mislead many.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	6	"You will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not frightened, for those things must take place, but that is not yet the end.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	7	"For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and in various places there will be famines and earthquakes.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	8	"But all these things are merely the beginning of birth pangs.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	9	"Then they will deliver you to tribulation, and will kill you, and you will be hated by all nations because of My name.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	10	"At that time many will fall away and will betray one another and hate one another.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	11	"Many false prophets will arise and will mislead many.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	12	"Because lawlessness is increased, most people's love will grow cold.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	13	"But the one who endures to the end, he will be saved.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	14	"This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	15	"Therefore when you see the ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand),
Matthew	Mat	40	24	16	then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	17	"Whoever is on the housetop must not go down to get the things out that are in his house.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	18	"Whoever is in the field must not turn back to get his cloak.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	19	"But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days!
Matthew	Mat	40	24	20	"But pray that your flight will not be in the winter, or on a Sabbath.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	21	"For then there will be a great tribulation, such as has not occurred since the beginning of the world until now, nor ever will.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	22	"Unless those days had been cut short, no life would have been saved; but for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	23	"Then if anyone says to you, 'Behold, here is the Christ,' or 'There He is,' do not believe him.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	24	"For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders, so as to mislead, if possible, even the elect.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	25	"Behold, I have told you in advance.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	26	"So if they say to you, 'Behold, He is in the wilderness,' do not go out, or, 'Behold, He is in the inner rooms,' do not believe them.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	27	"For just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes even to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	28	"Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	29	"But immediately after the tribulation of those days THE SUN WILL BE DARKENED, AND THE MOON WILL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT, AND THE STARS WILL FALL from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	30	"And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the SON OF MAN COMING ON THE CLOUDS OF THE SKY with power and great glory.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	31	"And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	32	"Now learn the parable from the fig tree: when its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near;
Matthew	Mat	40	24	33	so, you too, when you see all these things, recognize that He is near, right at the door.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	34	"Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	35	"Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	36	"But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	37	"For the coming of the Son of Man will be just like the days of Noah.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	38	"For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark,
Matthew	Mat	40	24	39	and they did not understand until the flood came and took them all away; so will the coming of the Son of Man be.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	40	"Then there will be two men in the field; one will be taken and one will be left.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	41	"Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one will be left.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	42	"Therefore be on the alert, for you do not know which day your Lord is coming.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	43	"But be sure of this, that if the head of the house had known at what time of the night the thief was coming, he would have been on the alert and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	44	"For this reason you also must be ready; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour when you do not think He will.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	45	"Who then is the faithful and sensible slave whom his master put in charge of his household to give them their food at the proper time?
Matthew	Mat	40	24	46	"Blessed is that slave whom his master finds so doing when he comes.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	47	"Truly I say to you that he will put him in charge of all his possessions.
Matthew	Mat	40	24	48	"But if that evil slave says in his heart, 'My master is not coming for a long time,'
Matthew	Mat	40	24	49	and begins to beat his fellow slaves and eat and drink with drunkards;
Matthew	Mat	40	24	50	the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour which he does not know,
Matthew	Mat	40	24	51	and will cut him in pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Matthew	Mat	40	25	1	"Then the kingdom of heaven will be comparable to ten virgins, who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Matthew	Mat	40	25	2	"Five of them were foolish, and five were prudent.
Matthew	Mat	40	25	3	"For when the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them,
Matthew	Mat	40	25	4	but the prudent took oil in flasks along with their lamps.
Matthew	Mat	40	25	5	"Now while the bridegroom was delaying, they all got drowsy and began to sleep.
Matthew	Mat	40	25	6	"But at midnight there was a shout, 'Behold, the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.'
Matthew	Mat	40	25	7	"Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps.
Matthew	Mat	40	25	8	"The foolish said to the prudent, 'Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.'
Matthew	Mat	40	25	9	"But the prudent answered, 'No, there will not be enough for us and you too; go instead to the dealers and buy some for yourselves.'
Matthew	Mat	40	25	10	"And while they were going away to make the purchase, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast; and the door was shut.
Matthew	Mat	40	25	11	"Later the other virgins also came, saying, 'Lord, lord, open up for us.'
Matthew	Mat	40	25	12	"But he answered, 'Truly I say to you, I do not know you.'
Matthew	Mat	40	25	13	"Be on the alert then, for you do not know the day nor the hour.
Matthew	Mat	40	25	14	"For it is just like a man about to go on a journey, who called his own slaves and entrusted his possessions to them.
Matthew	Mat	40	25	15	"To one he gave five talents, to another, two, and to another, one, each according to his own ability; and he went on his journey.
Matthew	Mat	40	25	16	"Immediately the one who had received the five talents went and traded with them, and gained five more talents.
Matthew	Mat	40	25	17	"In the same manner the one who had received the two talents gained two more.
Matthew	Mat	40	25	18	"But he who received the one talent went away, and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money.
Matthew	Mat	40	25	19	"Now after a long time the master of those slaves *came and *settled accounts with them.
Matthew	Mat	40	25	20	"The one who had received the five talents came up and brought five more talents, saying, 'Master, you entrusted five talents to me. See, I have gained five more talents.'
Matthew	Mat	40	25	21	"His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful with a few things, I will put you in charge of many things; enter into the joy of your master.'
Matthew	Mat	40	25	22	"Also the one who had received the two talents came up and said, 'Master, you entrusted two talents to me. See, I have gained two more talents.'
Matthew	Mat	40	25	23	"His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful with a few things, I will put you in charge of many things; enter into the joy of your master.'
Matthew	Mat	40	25	24	"And the one also who had received the one talent came up and said, 'Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you scattered no seed.
Matthew	Mat	40	25	25	'And I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the ground. See, you have what is yours.'
Matthew	Mat	40	25	26	"But his master answered and said to him, 'You wicked, lazy slave, you knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I scattered no seed.
Matthew	Mat	40	25	27	'Then you ought to have put my money in the bank, and on my arrival I would have received my money back with interest.
Matthew	Mat	40	25	28	'Therefore take away the talent from him, and give it to the one who has the ten talents.'
Matthew	Mat	40	25	29	"For to everyone who has, more shall be given, and he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have, even what he does have shall be taken away.
Matthew	Mat	40	25	30	"Throw out the worthless slave into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Matthew	Mat	40	25	31	"But when the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, then He will sit on His glorious throne.
Matthew	Mat	40	25	32	"All the nations will be gathered before Him; and He will separate them from one another, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats;
Matthew	Mat	40	25	33	and He will put the sheep on His right, and the goats on the left.
Matthew	Mat	40	25	34	"Then the King will say to those on His right, 'Come, you who are blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
Matthew	Mat	40	25	35	'For I was hungry, and you gave Me something to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me something to drink; I was a stranger, and you invited Me in;
Matthew	Mat	40	25	36	naked, and you clothed Me; I was sick, and you visited Me; I was in prison, and you came to Me.'
Matthew	Mat	40	25	37	"Then the righteous will answer Him, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry, and feed You, or thirsty, and give You something to drink?
Matthew	Mat	40	25	38	'And when did we see You a stranger, and invite You in, or naked, and clothe You?
Matthew	Mat	40	25	39	'When did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?'
Matthew	Mat	40	25	40	"The King will answer and say to them, 'Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did it to one of these brothers of Mine, even the least of them, you did it to Me.'
Matthew	Mat	40	25	41	"Then He will also say to those on His left, 'Depart from Me, accursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels;
Matthew	Mat	40	25	42	for I was hungry, and you gave Me nothing to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me nothing to drink;
Matthew	Mat	40	25	43	I was a stranger, and you did not invite Me in; naked, and you did not clothe Me; sick, and in prison, and you did not visit Me.'
Matthew	Mat	40	25	44	"Then they themselves also will answer, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not take care of You?'
Matthew	Mat	40	25	45	"Then He will answer them, 'Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to Me.'
Matthew	Mat	40	25	46	"These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life."
Matthew	Mat	40	26	1	When Jesus had finished all these words, He said to His disciples,
Matthew	Mat	40	26	2	"You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man is to be handed over for crucifixion."
Matthew	Mat	40	26	3	Then the chief priests and the elders of the people were gathered together in the court of the high priest, named Caiaphas;
Matthew	Mat	40	26	4	and they plotted together to seize Jesus by stealth and kill Him.
Matthew	Mat	40	26	5	But they were saying, "Not during the festival, otherwise a riot might occur among the people."
Matthew	Mat	40	26	6	Now when Jesus was in Bethany, at the home of Simon the leper,
Matthew	Mat	40	26	7	a woman came to Him with an alabaster vial of very costly perfume, and she poured it on His head as He reclined at the table.
Matthew	Mat	40	26	8	But the disciples were indignant when they saw this, and said, "Why this waste?
Matthew	Mat	40	26	9	"For this perfume might have been sold for a high price and the money given to the poor."
Matthew	Mat	40	26	10	But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, "Why do you bother the woman? For she has done a good deed to Me.
Matthew	Mat	40	26	11	"For you always have the poor with you; but you do not always have Me.
Matthew	Mat	40	26	12	"For when she poured this perfume on My body, she did it to prepare Me for burial.
Matthew	Mat	40	26	13	"Truly I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be spoken of in memory of her."
Matthew	Mat	40	26	14	Then one of the twelve, named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests
Matthew	Mat	40	26	15	and said, "What are you willing to give me to betray Him to you?" And they weighed out thirty pieces of silver to him.
Matthew	Mat	40	26	16	From then on he began looking for a good opportunity to betray Jesus.
Matthew	Mat	40	26	17	Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover?"
Matthew	Mat	40	26	18	And He said, "Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, 'The Teacher says, "My time is near; I am to keep the Passover at your house with My disciples."'"
Matthew	Mat	40	26	19	The disciples did as Jesus had directed them; and they prepared the Passover.
Matthew	Mat	40	26	20	Now when evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples.
Matthew	Mat	40	26	21	As they were eating, He said, "Truly I say to you that one of you will betray Me."
Matthew	Mat	40	26	22	Being deeply grieved, they each one began to say to Him, "Surely not I, Lord?"
Matthew	Mat	40	26	23	And He answered, "He who dipped his hand with Me in the bowl is the one who will betray Me.
Matthew	Mat	40	26	24	"The Son of Man is to go, just as it is written of Him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born."
Matthew	Mat	40	26	25	And Judas, who was betraying Him, said, "Surely it is not I, Rabbi?" Jesus *said to him, "You have said it yourself."
Matthew	Mat	40	26	26	While they were eating, Jesus took some bread, and after a blessing, He broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, "Take, eat; this is My body."
Matthew	Mat	40	26	27	And when He had taken a cup and given thanks, He gave it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you;
Matthew	Mat	40	26	28	for this is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for forgiveness of sins.
Matthew	Mat	40	26	29	"But I say to you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father's kingdom."
Matthew	Mat	40	26	30	After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
Matthew	Mat	40	26	31	Then Jesus *said to them, "You will all fall away because of Me this night, for it is written, 'I WILL STRIKE DOWN THE SHEPHERD, AND THE SHEEP OF THE FLOCK SHALL BE SCATTERED.'
Matthew	Mat	40	26	32	"But after I have been raised, I will go ahead of you to Galilee."
Matthew	Mat	40	26	33	But Peter said to Him, "Even though all may fall away because of You, I will never fall away."
Matthew	Mat	40	26	34	Jesus said to him, "Truly I say to you that this very night, before a rooster crows, you will deny Me three times."
Matthew	Mat	40	26	35	Peter *said to Him, "Even if I have to die with You, I will not deny You." All the disciples said the same thing too.
Matthew	Mat	40	26	36	Then Jesus *came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and *said to His disciples, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
Matthew	Mat	40	26	37	And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be grieved and distressed.
Matthew	Mat	40	26	38	Then He *said to them, "My soul is deeply grieved, to the point of death; remain here and keep watch with Me."
Matthew	Mat	40	26	39	And He went a little beyond them, and fell on His face and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; yet not as I will, but as You will."
Matthew	Mat	40	26	40	And He *came to the disciples and *found them sleeping, and *said to Peter, "So, you men could not keep watch with Me for one hour?
Matthew	Mat	40	26	41	"Keep watching and praying that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."
Matthew	Mat	40	26	42	He went away again a second time and prayed, saying, "My Father, if this cannot pass away unless I drink it, Your will be done."
Matthew	Mat	40	26	43	Again He came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.
Matthew	Mat	40	26	44	And He left them again, and went away and prayed a third time, saying the same thing once more.
Matthew	Mat	40	26	45	Then He *came to the disciples and *said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.
Matthew	Mat	40	26	46	"Get up, let us be going; behold, the one who betrays Me is at hand!"
Matthew	Mat	40	26	47	While He was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came up accompanied by a large crowd with swords and clubs, who came from the chief priests and elders of the people.
Matthew	Mat	40	26	48	Now he who was betraying Him gave them a sign, saying, "Whomever I kiss, He is the one; seize Him."
Matthew	Mat	40	26	49	Immediately Judas went to Jesus and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed Him.
Matthew	Mat	40	26	50	And Jesus said to him, "Friend, do what you have come for." Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and seized Him.
Matthew	Mat	40	26	51	And behold, one of those who were with Jesus reached and drew out his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his ear.
Matthew	Mat	40	26	52	Then Jesus *said to him, "Put your sword back into its place; for all those who take up the sword shall perish by the sword.
Matthew	Mat	40	26	53	"Or do you think that I cannot appeal to My Father, and He will at once put at My disposal more than twelve legions of angels?
Matthew	Mat	40	26	54	"How then will the Scriptures be fulfilled, which say that it must happen this way?"
Matthew	Mat	40	26	55	At that time Jesus said to the crowds, "Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me as you would against a robber? Every day I used to sit in the temple teaching and you did not seize Me.
Matthew	Mat	40	26	56	"But all this has taken place to fulfill the Scriptures of the prophets." Then all the disciples left Him and fled.
Matthew	Mat	40	26	57	Those who had seized Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.
Matthew	Mat	40	26	58	But Peter was following Him at a distance as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and entered in, and sat down with the officers to see the outcome.
Matthew	Mat	40	26	59	Now the chief priests and the whole Council kept trying to obtain false testimony against Jesus, so that they might put Him to death.
Matthew	Mat	40	26	60	They did not find any, even though many false witnesses came forward. But later on two came forward,
Matthew	Mat	40	26	61	and said, "This man stated, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and to rebuild it in three days.'"
Matthew	Mat	40	26	62	The high priest stood up and said to Him, "Do You not answer? What is it that these men are testifying against You?"
Matthew	Mat	40	26	63	But Jesus kept silent. And the high priest said to Him, "I adjure You by the living God, that You tell us whether You are the Christ, the Son of God."
Matthew	Mat	40	26	64	Jesus *said to him, "You have said it yourself; nevertheless I tell you, hereafter you will see THE SON OF MAN SITTING AT THE RIGHT HAND OF POWER, and COMING ON THE CLOUDS OF HEAVEN."
Matthew	Mat	40	26	65	Then the high priest tore his robes and said, "He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, you have now heard the blasphemy;
Matthew	Mat	40	26	66	what do you think?" They answered, "He deserves death!"
Matthew	Mat	40	26	67	Then they spat in His face and beat Him with their fists; and others slapped Him,
Matthew	Mat	40	26	68	and said, "Prophesy to us, You Christ; who is the one who hit You?"
Matthew	Mat	40	26	69	Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant-girl came to him and said, "You too were with Jesus the Galilean."
Matthew	Mat	40	26	70	But he denied it before them all, saying, "I do not know what you are talking about."
Matthew	Mat	40	26	71	When he had gone out to the gateway, another servant-girl saw him and *said to those who were there, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
Matthew	Mat	40	26	72	And again he denied it with an oath, "I do not know the man."
Matthew	Mat	40	26	73	A little later the bystanders came up and said to Peter, "Surely you too are one of them; for even the way you talk gives you away."
Matthew	Mat	40	26	74	Then he began to curse and swear, "I do not know the man!" And immediately a rooster crowed.
Matthew	Mat	40	26	75	And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said, "Before a rooster crows, you will deny Me three times." And he went out and wept bitterly.
Matthew	Mat	40	27	1	Now when morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people conferred together against Jesus to put Him to death;
Matthew	Mat	40	27	2	and they bound Him, and led Him away and delivered Him to Pilate the governor.
Matthew	Mat	40	27	3	Then when Judas, who had betrayed Him, saw that He had been condemned, he felt remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
Matthew	Mat	40	27	4	saying, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood." But they said, "What is that to us? See to that yourself!"
Matthew	Mat	40	27	5	And he threw the pieces of silver into the temple sanctuary and departed; and he went away and hanged himself.
Matthew	Mat	40	27	6	The chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, "It is not lawful to put them into the temple treasury, since it is the price of blood."
Matthew	Mat	40	27	7	And they conferred together and with the money bought the Potter's Field as a burial place for strangers.
Matthew	Mat	40	27	8	For this reason that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.
Matthew	Mat	40	27	9	Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: "AND THEY TOOK THE THIRTY PIECES OF SILVER, THE PRICE OF THE ONE WHOSE PRICE HAD BEEN SET by the sons of Israel;
Matthew	Mat	40	27	10	AND THEY GAVE THEM FOR THE POTTER'S FIELD, AS THE LORD DIRECTED ME."
Matthew	Mat	40	27	11	Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor questioned Him, saying, "Are You the King of the Jews?" And Jesus said to him, "It is as you say."
Matthew	Mat	40	27	12	And while He was being accused by the chief priests and elders, He did not answer.
Matthew	Mat	40	27	13	Then Pilate *said to Him, "Do You not hear how many things they testify against You?"
Matthew	Mat	40	27	14	And He did not answer him with regard to even a single charge, so the governor was quite amazed.
Matthew	Mat	40	27	15	Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the people any one prisoner whom they wanted.
Matthew	Mat	40	27	16	At that time they were holding a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas.
Matthew	Mat	40	27	17	So when the people gathered together, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release for you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?"
Matthew	Mat	40	27	18	For he knew that because of envy they had handed Him over.
Matthew	Mat	40	27	19	While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message, saying, "Have nothing to do with that righteous Man; for last night I suffered greatly in a dream because of Him."
Matthew	Mat	40	27	20	But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to put Jesus to death.
Matthew	Mat	40	27	21	But the governor said to them, "Which of the two do you want me to release for you?" And they said, "Barabbas."
Matthew	Mat	40	27	22	Pilate *said to them, "Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" They all *said, "Crucify Him!"
Matthew	Mat	40	27	23	And he said, "Why, what evil has He done?" But they kept shouting all the more, saying, "Crucify Him!"
Matthew	Mat	40	27	24	When Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but rather that a riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this Man's blood; see to that yourselves."
Matthew	Mat	40	27	25	And all the people said, "His blood shall be on us and on our children!"
Matthew	Mat	40	27	26	Then he released Barabbas for them; but after having Jesus scourged, he handed Him over to be crucified.
Matthew	Mat	40	27	27	Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole Roman cohort around Him.
Matthew	Mat	40	27	28	They stripped Him and put a scarlet robe on Him.
Matthew	Mat	40	27	29	And after twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on His head, and a reed in His right hand; and they knelt down before Him and mocked Him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
Matthew	Mat	40	27	30	They spat on Him, and took the reed and began to beat Him on the head.
Matthew	Mat	40	27	31	After they had mocked Him, they took the scarlet robe off Him and put His own garments back on Him, and led Him away to crucify Him.
Matthew	Mat	40	27	32	As they were coming out, they found a man of Cyrene named Simon, whom they pressed into service to bear His cross.
Matthew	Mat	40	27	33	And when they came to a place called Golgotha, which means Place of a Skull,
Matthew	Mat	40	27	34	they gave Him wine to drink mixed with gall; and after tasting it, He was unwilling to drink.
Matthew	Mat	40	27	35	And when they had crucified Him, they divided up His garments among themselves by casting lots.
Matthew	Mat	40	27	36	And sitting down, they began to keep watch over Him there.
Matthew	Mat	40	27	37	And above His head they put up the charge against Him which read, "THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS."
Matthew	Mat	40	27	38	At that time two robbers *were crucified with Him, one on the right and one on the left.
Matthew	Mat	40	27	39	And those passing by were hurling abuse at Him, wagging their heads
Matthew	Mat	40	27	40	and saying, "You who are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross."
Matthew	Mat	40	27	41	In the same way the chief priests also, along with the scribes and elders, were mocking Him and saying,
Matthew	Mat	40	27	42	"He saved others; He cannot save Himself. He is the King of Israel; let Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe in Him.
Matthew	Mat	40	27	43	"HE TRUSTS IN GOD; LET GOD RESCUE Him now, IF HE DELIGHTS IN HIM; for He said, 'I am the Son of God.'"
Matthew	Mat	40	27	44	The robbers who had been crucified with Him were also insulting Him with the same words.
Matthew	Mat	40	27	45	Now from the sixth hour darkness fell upon all the land until the ninth hour.
Matthew	Mat	40	27	46	About the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "ELI, ELI, LAMA SABACHTHANI?" that is, "MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME?"
Matthew	Mat	40	27	47	And some of those who were standing there, when they heard it, began saying, "This man is calling for Elijah."
Matthew	Mat	40	27	48	Immediately one of them ran, and taking a sponge, he filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed, and gave Him a drink.
Matthew	Mat	40	27	49	But the rest of them said, "Let us see whether Elijah will come to save Him."
Matthew	Mat	40	27	50	And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up His spirit.
Matthew	Mat	40	27	51	And behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom; and the earth shook and the rocks were split.
Matthew	Mat	40	27	52	The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised;
Matthew	Mat	40	27	53	and coming out of the tombs after His resurrection they entered the holy city and appeared to many.
Matthew	Mat	40	27	54	Now the centurion, and those who were with him keeping guard over Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that were happening, became very frightened and said, "Truly this was the Son of God!"
Matthew	Mat	40	27	55	Many women were there looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee while ministering to Him.
Matthew	Mat	40	27	56	Among them was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
Matthew	Mat	40	27	57	When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who himself had also become a disciple of Jesus.
Matthew	Mat	40	27	58	This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him.
Matthew	Mat	40	27	59	And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
Matthew	Mat	40	27	60	and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock; and he rolled a large stone against the entrance of the tomb and went away.
Matthew	Mat	40	27	61	And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the grave.
Matthew	Mat	40	27	62	Now on the next day, the day after the preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together with Pilate,
Matthew	Mat	40	27	63	and said, "Sir, we remember that when He was still alive that deceiver said, 'After three days I am to rise again.'
Matthew	Mat	40	27	64	"Therefore, give orders for the grave to be made secure until the third day, otherwise His disciples may come and steal Him away and say to the people, 'He has risen from the dead,' and the last deception will be worse than the first."
Matthew	Mat	40	27	65	Pilate said to them, "You have a guard; go, make it as secure as you know how."
Matthew	Mat	40	27	66	And they went and made the grave secure, and along with the guard they set a seal on the stone.
Matthew	Mat	40	28	1	Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to look at the grave.
Matthew	Mat	40	28	2	And behold, a severe earthquake had occurred, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it.
Matthew	Mat	40	28	3	And his appearance was like lightning, and his clothing as white as snow.
Matthew	Mat	40	28	4	The guards shook for fear of him and became like dead men.
Matthew	Mat	40	28	5	The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid; for I know that you are looking for Jesus who has been crucified.
Matthew	Mat	40	28	6	"He is not here, for He has risen, just as He said. Come, see the place where He was lying.
Matthew	Mat	40	28	7	"Go quickly and tell His disciples that He has risen from the dead; and behold, He is going ahead of you into Galilee, there you will see Him; behold, I have told you."
Matthew	Mat	40	28	8	And they left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy and ran to report it to His disciples.
Matthew	Mat	40	28	9	And behold, Jesus met them and greeted them. And they came up and took hold of His feet and worshiped Him.
Matthew	Mat	40	28	10	Then Jesus *said to them, "Do not be afraid; go and take word to My brethren to leave for Galilee, and there they will see Me."
Matthew	Mat	40	28	11	Now while they were on their way, some of the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened.
Matthew	Mat	40	28	12	And when they had assembled with the elders and consulted together, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,
Matthew	Mat	40	28	13	and said, "You are to say, 'His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we were asleep.'
Matthew	Mat	40	28	14	"And if this should come to the governor's ears, we will win him over and keep you out of trouble."
Matthew	Mat	40	28	15	And they took the money and did as they had been instructed; and this story was widely spread among the Jews, and is to this day.
Matthew	Mat	40	28	16	But the eleven disciples proceeded to Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had designated.
Matthew	Mat	40	28	17	When they saw Him, they worshiped Him; but some were doubtful.
Matthew	Mat	40	28	18	And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.
Matthew	Mat	40	28	19	"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit,
Matthew	Mat	40	28	20	teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age."
Mark	Mark	41	1	1	The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Mark	Mark	41	1	2	As it is written in Isaiah the prophet: "BEHOLD, I SEND MY MESSENGER AHEAD OF YOU, WHO WILL PREPARE YOUR WAY;
Mark	Mark	41	1	3	THE VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS, 'MAKE READY THE WAY OF THE LORD, MAKE HIS PATHS STRAIGHT.'"
Mark	Mark	41	1	4	John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
Mark	Mark	41	1	5	And all the country of Judea was going out to him, and all the people of Jerusalem; and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.
Mark	Mark	41	1	6	John was clothed with camel's hair and wore a leather belt around his waist, and his diet was locusts and wild honey.
Mark	Mark	41	1	7	And he was preaching, and saying, "After me One is coming who is mightier than I, and I am not fit to stoop down and untie the thong of His sandals.
Mark	Mark	41	1	8	"I baptized you with water; but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."
Mark	Mark	41	1	9	In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
Mark	Mark	41	1	10	Immediately coming up out of the water, He saw the heavens opening, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon Him;
Mark	Mark	41	1	11	and a voice came out of the heavens: "You are My beloved Son, in You I am well-pleased."
Mark	Mark	41	1	12	Immediately the Spirit *impelled Him to go out into the wilderness.
Mark	Mark	41	1	13	And He was in the wilderness forty days being tempted by Satan; and He was with the wild beasts, and the angels were ministering to Him.
Mark	Mark	41	1	14	Now after John had been taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God,
Mark	Mark	41	1	15	and saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel."
Mark	Mark	41	1	16	As He was going along by the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew, the brother of Simon, casting a net in the sea; for they were fishermen.
Mark	Mark	41	1	17	And Jesus said to them, "Follow Me, and I will make you become fishers of men."
Mark	Mark	41	1	18	Immediately they left their nets and followed Him.
Mark	Mark	41	1	19	Going on a little farther, He saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who were also in the boat mending the nets.
Mark	Mark	41	1	20	Immediately He called them; and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went away to follow Him.
Mark	Mark	41	1	21	They *went into Capernaum; and immediately on the Sabbath He entered the synagogue and began to teach.
Mark	Mark	41	1	22	They were amazed at His teaching; for He was teaching them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
Mark	Mark	41	1	23	Just then there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,
Mark	Mark	41	1	24	saying, "What business do we have with each other, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are--the Holy One of God!"
Mark	Mark	41	1	25	And Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be quiet, and come out of him!"
Mark	Mark	41	1	26	Throwing him into convulsions, the unclean spirit cried out with a loud voice and came out of him.
Mark	Mark	41	1	27	They were all amazed, so that they debated among themselves, saying, "What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him."
Mark	Mark	41	1	28	Immediately the news about Him spread everywhere into all the surrounding district of Galilee.
Mark	Mark	41	1	29	And immediately after they came out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
Mark	Mark	41	1	30	Now Simon's mother-in-law was lying sick with a fever; and immediately they *spoke to Jesus about her.
Mark	Mark	41	1	31	And He came to her and raised her up, taking her by the hand, and the fever left her, and she waited on them.
Mark	Mark	41	1	32	When evening came, after the sun had set, they began bringing to Him all who were ill and those who were demon-possessed.
Mark	Mark	41	1	33	And the whole city had gathered at the door.
Mark	Mark	41	1	34	And He healed many who were ill with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and He was not permitting the demons to speak, because they knew who He was.
Mark	Mark	41	1	35	In the early morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house, and went away to a secluded place, and was praying there.
Mark	Mark	41	1	36	Simon and his companions searched for Him;
Mark	Mark	41	1	37	they found Him, and *said to Him, "Everyone is looking for You."
Mark	Mark	41	1	38	He *said to them, "Let us go somewhere else to the towns nearby, so that I may preach there also; for that is what I came for."
Mark	Mark	41	1	39	And He went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out the demons.
Mark	Mark	41	1	40	And a leper *came to Jesus, beseeching Him and falling on his knees before Him, and saying, "If You are willing, You can make me clean."
Mark	Mark	41	1	41	Moved with compassion, Jesus stretched out His hand and touched him, and *said to him, "I am willing; be cleansed."
Mark	Mark	41	1	42	Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed.
Mark	Mark	41	1	43	And He sternly warned him and immediately sent him away,
Mark	Mark	41	1	44	and He *said to him, "See that you say nothing to anyone; but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, as a testimony to them."
Mark	Mark	41	1	45	But he went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the news around, to such an extent that Jesus could no longer publicly enter a city, but stayed out in unpopulated areas; and they were coming to Him from everywhere.
Mark	Mark	41	2	1	When He had come back to Capernaum several days afterward, it was heard that He was at home.
Mark	Mark	41	2	2	And many were gathered together, so that there was no longer room, not even near the door; and He was speaking the word to them.
Mark	Mark	41	2	3	And they *came, bringing to Him a paralytic, carried by four men.
Mark	Mark	41	2	4	Being unable to get to Him because of the crowd, they removed the roof above Him; and when they had dug an opening, they let down the pallet on which the paralytic was lying.
Mark	Mark	41	2	5	And Jesus seeing their faith *said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
Mark	Mark	41	2	6	But some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts,
Mark	Mark	41	2	7	"Why does this man speak that way? He is blaspheming; who can forgive sins but God alone?"
Mark	Mark	41	2	8	Immediately Jesus, aware in His spirit that they were reasoning that way within themselves, *said to them, "Why are you reasoning about these things in your hearts?
Mark	Mark	41	2	9	"Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven'; or to say, 'Get up, and pick up your pallet and walk'?
Mark	Mark	41	2	10	"But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins"--He *said to the paralytic,
Mark	Mark	41	2	11	"I say to you, get up, pick up your pallet and go home."
Mark	Mark	41	2	12	And he got up and immediately picked up the pallet and went out in the sight of everyone, so that they were all amazed and were glorifying God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this."
Mark	Mark	41	2	13	And He went out again by the seashore; and all the people were coming to Him, and He was teaching them.
Mark	Mark	41	2	14	As He passed by, He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting in the tax booth, and He *said to him, "Follow Me!" And he got up and followed Him.
Mark	Mark	41	2	15	And it *happened that He was reclining at the table in his house, and many tax collectors and sinners were dining with Jesus and His disciples; for there were many of them, and they were following Him.
Mark	Mark	41	2	16	When the scribes of the Pharisees saw that He was eating with the sinners and tax collectors, they said to His disciples, "Why is He eating and drinking with tax collectors and sinners?"
Mark	Mark	41	2	17	And hearing this, Jesus *said to them, "It is not those who are healthy who need a physician, but those who are sick; I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners."
Mark	Mark	41	2	18	John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting; and they *came and *said to Him, "Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but Your disciples do not fast?"
Mark	Mark	41	2	19	And Jesus said to them, "While the bridegroom is with them, the attendants of the bridegroom cannot fast, can they? So long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
Mark	Mark	41	2	20	"But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day.
Mark	Mark	41	2	21	"No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; otherwise the patch pulls away from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear results.
Mark	Mark	41	2	22	"No one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the wine will burst the skins, and the wine is lost and the skins as well; but one puts new wine into fresh wineskins."
Mark	Mark	41	2	23	And it happened that He was passing through the grainfields on the Sabbath, and His disciples began to make their way along while picking the heads of grain.
Mark	Mark	41	2	24	The Pharisees were saying to Him, "Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?"
Mark	Mark	41	2	25	And He *said to them, "Have you never read what David did when he was in need and he and his companions became hungry;
Mark	Mark	41	2	26	how he entered the house of God in the time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the consecrated bread, which is not lawful for anyone to eat except the priests, and he also gave it to those who were with him?"
Mark	Mark	41	2	27	Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.
Mark	Mark	41	2	28	"So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."
Mark	Mark	41	3	1	He entered again into a synagogue; and a man was there whose hand was withered.
Mark	Mark	41	3	2	They were watching Him to see if He would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse Him.
Mark	Mark	41	3	3	He *said to the man with the withered hand, "Get up and come forward!"
Mark	Mark	41	3	4	And He *said to them, "Is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the Sabbath, to save a life or to kill?" But they kept silent.
Mark	Mark	41	3	5	After looking around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, He *said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored.
Mark	Mark	41	3	6	The Pharisees went out and immediately began conspiring with the Herodians against Him, as to how they might destroy Him.
Mark	Mark	41	3	7	Jesus withdrew to the sea with His disciples; and a great multitude from Galilee followed; and also from Judea,
Mark	Mark	41	3	8	and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and beyond the Jordan, and the vicinity of Tyre and Sidon, a great number of people heard of all that He was doing and came to Him.
Mark	Mark	41	3	9	And He told His disciples that a boat should stand ready for Him because of the crowd, so that they would not crowd Him;
Mark	Mark	41	3	10	for He had healed many, with the result that all those who had afflictions pressed around Him in order to touch Him.
Mark	Mark	41	3	11	Whenever the unclean spirits saw Him, they would fall down before Him and shout, "You are the Son of God!"
Mark	Mark	41	3	12	And He earnestly warned them not to tell who He was.
Mark	Mark	41	3	13	And He *went up on the mountain and *summoned those whom He Himself wanted, and they came to Him.
Mark	Mark	41	3	14	And He appointed twelve, so that they would be with Him and that He could send them out to preach,
Mark	Mark	41	3	15	and to have authority to cast out the demons.
Mark	Mark	41	3	16	And He appointed the twelve: Simon (to whom He gave the name Peter),
Mark	Mark	41	3	17	and James, the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James (to them He gave the name Boanerges, which means, "Sons of Thunder");
Mark	Mark	41	3	18	and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot;
Mark	Mark	41	3	19	and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Him.
Mark	Mark	41	3	20	And He *came home, and the crowd *gathered again, to such an extent that they could not even eat a meal.
Mark	Mark	41	3	21	When His own people heard of this, they went out to take custody of Him; for they were saying, "He has lost His senses."
Mark	Mark	41	3	22	The scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying, "He is possessed by Beelzebul," and "He casts out the demons by the ruler of the demons."
Mark	Mark	41	3	23	And He called them to Himself and began speaking to them in parables, "How can Satan cast out Satan?
Mark	Mark	41	3	24	"If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
Mark	Mark	41	3	25	"If a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.
Mark	Mark	41	3	26	"If Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but he is finished!
Mark	Mark	41	3	27	"But no one can enter the strong man's house and plunder his property unless he first binds the strong man, and then he will plunder his house.
Mark	Mark	41	3	28	"Truly I say to you, all sins shall be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they utter;
Mark	Mark	41	3	29	but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin"--
Mark	Mark	41	3	30	because they were saying, "He has an unclean spirit."
Mark	Mark	41	3	31	Then His mother and His brothers *arrived, and standing outside they sent word to Him and called Him.
Mark	Mark	41	3	32	A crowd was sitting around Him, and they *said to Him, "Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are outside looking for You."
Mark	Mark	41	3	33	Answering them, He *said, "Who are My mother and My brothers?"
Mark	Mark	41	3	34	Looking about at those who were sitting around Him, He *said, "Behold My mother and My brothers!
Mark	Mark	41	3	35	"For whoever does the will of God, he is My brother and sister and mother."
Mark	Mark	41	4	1	He began to teach again by the sea. And such a very large crowd gathered to Him that He got into a boat in the sea and sat down; and the whole crowd was by the sea on the land.
Mark	Mark	41	4	2	And He was teaching them many things in parables, and was saying to them in His teaching,
Mark	Mark	41	4	3	"Listen to this! Behold, the sower went out to sow;
Mark	Mark	41	4	4	as he was sowing, some seed fell beside the road, and the birds came and ate it up.
Mark	Mark	41	4	5	"Other seed fell on the rocky ground where it did not have much soil; and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of soil.
Mark	Mark	41	4	6	"And after the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.
Mark	Mark	41	4	7	"Other seed fell among the thorns, and the thorns came up and choked it, and it yielded no crop.
Mark	Mark	41	4	8	"Other seeds fell into the good soil, and as they grew up and increased, they yielded a crop and produced thirty, sixty, and a hundredfold."
Mark	Mark	41	4	9	And He was saying, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
Mark	Mark	41	4	10	As soon as He was alone, His followers, along with the twelve, began asking Him about the parables.
Mark	Mark	41	4	11	And He was saying to them, "To you has been given the mystery of the kingdom of God, but those who are outside get everything in parables,
Mark	Mark	41	4	12	so that WHILE SEEING, THEY MAY SEE AND NOT PERCEIVE, AND WHILE HEARING, THEY MAY HEAR AND NOT UNDERSTAND, OTHERWISE THEY MIGHT RETURN AND BE FORGIVEN."
Mark	Mark	41	4	13	And He *said to them, "Do you not understand this parable? How will you understand all the parables?
Mark	Mark	41	4	14	"The sower sows the word.
Mark	Mark	41	4	15	"These are the ones who are beside the road where the word is sown; and when they hear, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word which has been sown in them.
Mark	Mark	41	4	16	"In a similar way these are the ones on whom seed was sown on the rocky places, who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy;
Mark	Mark	41	4	17	and they have no firm root in themselves, but are only temporary; then, when affliction or persecution arises because of the word, immediately they fall away.
Mark	Mark	41	4	18	"And others are the ones on whom seed was sown among the thorns; these are the ones who have heard the word,
Mark	Mark	41	4	19	but the worries of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
Mark	Mark	41	4	20	"And those are the ones on whom seed was sown on the good soil; and they hear the word and accept it and bear fruit, thirty, sixty, and a hundredfold."
Mark	Mark	41	4	21	And He was saying to them, "A lamp is not brought to be put under a basket, is it, or under a bed? Is it not brought to be put on the lampstand?
Mark	Mark	41	4	22	"For nothing is hidden, except to be revealed; nor has anything been secret, but that it would come to light.
Mark	Mark	41	4	23	"If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear."
Mark	Mark	41	4	24	And He was saying to them, "Take care what you listen to. By your standard of measure it will be measured to you; and more will be given you besides.
Mark	Mark	41	4	25	"For whoever has, to him more shall be given; and whoever does not have, even what he has shall be taken away from him."
Mark	Mark	41	4	26	And He was saying, "The kingdom of God is like a man who casts seed upon the soil;
Mark	Mark	41	4	27	and he goes to bed at night and gets up by day, and the seed sprouts and grows--how, he himself does not know.
Mark	Mark	41	4	28	"The soil produces crops by itself; first the blade, then the head, then the mature grain in the head.
Mark	Mark	41	4	29	"But when the crop permits, he immediately puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come."
Mark	Mark	41	4	30	And He said, "How shall we picture the kingdom of God, or by what parable shall we present it?
Mark	Mark	41	4	31	"It is like a mustard seed, which, when sown upon the soil, though it is smaller than all the seeds that are upon the soil,
Mark	Mark	41	4	32	yet when it is sown, it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden plants and forms large branches; so that THE BIRDS OF THE AIR can NEST UNDER ITS SHADE."
Mark	Mark	41	4	33	With many such parables He was speaking the word to them, so far as they were able to hear it;
Mark	Mark	41	4	34	and He did not speak to them without a parable; but He was explaining everything privately to His own disciples.
Mark	Mark	41	4	35	On that day, when evening came, He *said to them, "Let us go over to the other side."
Mark	Mark	41	4	36	Leaving the crowd, they *took Him along with them in the boat, just as He was; and other boats were with Him.
Mark	Mark	41	4	37	And there *arose a fierce gale of wind, and the waves were breaking over the boat so much that the boat was already filling up.
Mark	Mark	41	4	38	Jesus Himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and they *woke Him and *said to Him, "Teacher, do You not care that we are perishing?"
Mark	Mark	41	4	39	And He got up and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, "Hush, be still." And the wind died down and it became perfectly calm.
Mark	Mark	41	4	40	And He said to them, "Why are you afraid? Do you still have no faith?"
Mark	Mark	41	4	41	They became very much afraid and said to one another, "Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?"
Mark	Mark	41	5	1	They came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gerasenes.
Mark	Mark	41	5	2	When He got out of the boat, immediately a man from the tombs with an unclean spirit met Him,
Mark	Mark	41	5	3	and he had his dwelling among the tombs. And no one was able to bind him anymore, even with a chain;
Mark	Mark	41	5	4	because he had often been bound with shackles and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him and the shackles broken in pieces, and no one was strong enough to subdue him.
Mark	Mark	41	5	5	Constantly, night and day, he was screaming among the tombs and in the mountains, and gashing himself with stones.
Mark	Mark	41	5	6	Seeing Jesus from a distance, he ran up and bowed down before Him;
Mark	Mark	41	5	7	and shouting with a loud voice, he *said, "What business do we have with each other, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I implore You by God, do not torment me!"
Mark	Mark	41	5	8	For He had been saying to him, "Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!"
Mark	Mark	41	5	9	And He was asking him, "What is your name?" And he *said to Him, "My name is Legion; for we are many."
Mark	Mark	41	5	10	And he began to implore Him earnestly not to send them out of the country.
Mark	Mark	41	5	11	Now there was a large herd of swine feeding nearby on the mountain.
Mark	Mark	41	5	12	The demons implored Him, saying, "Send us into the swine so that we may enter them."
Mark	Mark	41	5	13	Jesus gave them permission. And coming out, the unclean spirits entered the swine; and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea, about two thousand of them; and they were drowned in the sea.
Mark	Mark	41	5	14	Their herdsmen ran away and reported it in the city and in the country. And the people came to see what it was that had happened.
Mark	Mark	41	5	15	They *came to Jesus and *observed the man who had been demon-possessed sitting down, clothed and in his right mind, the very man who had had the "legion"; and they became frightened.
Mark	Mark	41	5	16	Those who had seen it described to them how it had happened to the demon-possessed man, and all about the swine.
Mark	Mark	41	5	17	And they began to implore Him to leave their region.
Mark	Mark	41	5	18	As He was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed was imploring Him that he might accompany Him.
Mark	Mark	41	5	19	And He did not let him, but He *said to him, "Go home to your people and report to them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how He had mercy on you."
Mark	Mark	41	5	20	And he went away and began to proclaim in Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him; and everyone was amazed.
Mark	Mark	41	5	21	When Jesus had crossed over again in the boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered around Him; and so He stayed by the seashore.
Mark	Mark	41	5	22	One of the synagogue officials named Jairus *came up, and on seeing Him, *fell at His feet
Mark	Mark	41	5	23	and *implored Him earnestly, saying, "My little daughter is at the point of death; please come and lay Your hands on her, so that she will get well and live."
Mark	Mark	41	5	24	And He went off with him; and a large crowd was following Him and pressing in on Him.
Mark	Mark	41	5	25	A woman who had had a hemorrhage for twelve years,
Mark	Mark	41	5	26	and had endured much at the hands of many physicians, and had spent all that she had and was not helped at all, but rather had grown worse--
Mark	Mark	41	5	27	after hearing about Jesus, she came up in the crowd behind Him and touched His cloak.
Mark	Mark	41	5	28	For she thought, "If I just touch His garments, I will get well."
Mark	Mark	41	5	29	Immediately the flow of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction.
Mark	Mark	41	5	30	Immediately Jesus, perceiving in Himself that the power proceeding from Him had gone forth, turned around in the crowd and said, "Who touched My garments?"
Mark	Mark	41	5	31	And His disciples said to Him, "You see the crowd pressing in on You, and You say, 'Who touched Me?'"
Mark	Mark	41	5	32	And He looked around to see the woman who had done this.
Mark	Mark	41	5	33	But the woman fearing and trembling, aware of what had happened to her, came and fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth.
Mark	Mark	41	5	34	And He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace and be healed of your affliction."
Mark	Mark	41	5	35	While He was still speaking, they *came from the house of the synagogue official, saying, "Your daughter has died; why trouble the Teacher anymore?"
Mark	Mark	41	5	36	But Jesus, overhearing what was being spoken, *said to the synagogue official, "Do not be afraid any longer, only believe."
Mark	Mark	41	5	37	And He allowed no one to accompany Him, except Peter and James and John the brother of James.
Mark	Mark	41	5	38	They *came to the house of the synagogue official; and He *saw a commotion, and people loudly weeping and wailing.
Mark	Mark	41	5	39	And entering in, He *said to them, "Why make a commotion and weep? The child has not died, but is asleep."
Mark	Mark	41	5	40	They began laughing at Him. But putting them all out, He *took along the child's father and mother and His own companions, and *entered the room where the child was.
Mark	Mark	41	5	41	Taking the child by the hand, He *said to her, "Talitha kum!" (which translated means, "Little girl, I say to you, get up!").
Mark	Mark	41	5	42	Immediately the girl got up and began to walk, for she was twelve years old. And immediately they were completely astounded.
Mark	Mark	41	5	43	And He gave them strict orders that no one should know about this, and He said that something should be given her to eat.
Mark	Mark	41	6	1	Jesus went out from there and *came into His hometown; and His disciples *followed Him.
Mark	Mark	41	6	2	When the Sabbath came, He began to teach in the synagogue; and the many listeners were astonished, saying, "Where did this man get these things, and what is this wisdom given to Him, and such miracles as these performed by His hands?
Mark	Mark	41	6	3	"Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? Are not His sisters here with us?" And they took offense at Him.
Mark	Mark	41	6	4	Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and among his own relatives and in his own household."
Mark	Mark	41	6	5	And He could do no miracle there except that He laid His hands on a few sick people and healed them.
Mark	Mark	41	6	6	And He wondered at their unbelief. And He was going around the villages teaching.
Mark	Mark	41	6	7	And He *summoned the twelve and began to send them out in pairs, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits;
Mark	Mark	41	6	8	and He instructed them that they should take nothing for their journey, except a mere staff--no bread, no bag, no money in their belt--
Mark	Mark	41	6	9	but to wear sandals; and He added, "Do not put on two tunics."
Mark	Mark	41	6	10	And He said to them, "Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave town.
Mark	Mark	41	6	11	"Any place that does not receive you or listen to you, as you go out from there, shake the dust off the soles of your feet for a testimony against them."
Mark	Mark	41	6	12	They went out and preached that men should repent.
Mark	Mark	41	6	13	And they were casting out many demons and were anointing with oil many sick people and healing them.
Mark	Mark	41	6	14	And King Herod heard of it, for His name had become well known; and people were saying, "John the Baptist has risen from the dead, and that is why these miraculous powers are at work in Him."
Mark	Mark	41	6	15	But others were saying, "He is Elijah." And others were saying, "He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old."
Mark	Mark	41	6	16	But when Herod heard of it, he kept saying, "John, whom I beheaded, has risen!"
Mark	Mark	41	6	17	For Herod himself had sent and had John arrested and bound in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, because he had married her.
Mark	Mark	41	6	18	For John had been saying to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."
Mark	Mark	41	6	19	Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to put him to death and could not do so;
Mark	Mark	41	6	20	for Herod was afraid of John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he kept him safe. And when he heard him, he was very perplexed; but he used to enjoy listening to him.
Mark	Mark	41	6	21	A strategic day came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his lords and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee;
Mark	Mark	41	6	22	and when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests; and the king said to the girl, "Ask me for whatever you want and I will give it to you."
Mark	Mark	41	6	23	And he swore to her, "Whatever you ask of me, I will give it to you; up to half of my kingdom."
Mark	Mark	41	6	24	And she went out and said to her mother, "What shall I ask for?" And she said, "The head of John the Baptist."
Mark	Mark	41	6	25	Immediately she came in a hurry to the king and asked, saying, "I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
Mark	Mark	41	6	26	And although the king was very sorry, yet because of his oaths and because of his dinner guests, he was unwilling to refuse her.
Mark	Mark	41	6	27	Immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded him to bring back his head. And he went and had him beheaded in the prison,
Mark	Mark	41	6	28	and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother.
Mark	Mark	41	6	29	When his disciples heard about this, they came and took away his body and laid it in a tomb.
Mark	Mark	41	6	30	The apostles *gathered together with Jesus; and they reported to Him all that they had done and taught.
Mark	Mark	41	6	31	And He *said to them, "Come away by yourselves to a secluded place and rest a while." (For there were many people coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat.)
Mark	Mark	41	6	32	They went away in the boat to a secluded place by themselves.
Mark	Mark	41	6	33	The people saw them going, and many recognized them and ran there together on foot from all the cities, and got there ahead of them.
Mark	Mark	41	6	34	When Jesus went ashore, He saw a large crowd, and He felt compassion for them because they were like sheep without a shepherd; and He began to teach them many things.
Mark	Mark	41	6	35	When it was already quite late, His disciples came to Him and said, "This place is desolate and it is already quite late;
Mark	Mark	41	6	36	send them away so that they may go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat."
Mark	Mark	41	6	37	But He answered them, "You give them something to eat!" And they *said to Him, "Shall we go and spend two hundred denarii on bread and give them something to eat?"
Mark	Mark	41	6	38	And He *said to them, "How many loaves do you have? Go look!" And when they found out, they *said, "Five, and two fish."
Mark	Mark	41	6	39	And He commanded them all to sit down by groups on the green grass.
Mark	Mark	41	6	40	They sat down in groups of hundreds and of fifties.
Mark	Mark	41	6	41	And He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up toward heaven, He blessed the food and broke the loaves and He kept giving them to the disciples to set before them; and He divided up the two fish among them all.
Mark	Mark	41	6	42	They all ate and were satisfied,
Mark	Mark	41	6	43	and they picked up twelve full baskets of the broken pieces, and also of the fish.
Mark	Mark	41	6	44	There were five thousand men who ate the loaves.
Mark	Mark	41	6	45	Immediately Jesus made His disciples get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side to Bethsaida, while He Himself was sending the crowd away.
Mark	Mark	41	6	46	After bidding them farewell, He left for the mountain to pray.
Mark	Mark	41	6	47	When it was evening, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and He was alone on the land.
Mark	Mark	41	6	48	Seeing them straining at the oars, for the wind was against them, at about the fourth watch of the night He *came to them, walking on the sea; and He intended to pass by them.
Mark	Mark	41	6	49	But when they saw Him walking on the sea, they supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out;
Mark	Mark	41	6	50	for they all saw Him and were terrified. But immediately He spoke with them and *said to them, "Take courage; it is I, do not be afraid."
Mark	Mark	41	6	51	Then He got into the boat with them, and the wind stopped; and they were utterly astonished,
Mark	Mark	41	6	52	for they had not gained any insight from the incident of the loaves, but their heart was hardened.
Mark	Mark	41	6	53	When they had crossed over they came to land at Gennesaret, and moored to the shore.
Mark	Mark	41	6	54	When they got out of the boat, immediately the people recognized Him,
Mark	Mark	41	6	55	and ran about that whole country and began to carry here and there on their pallets those who were sick, to the place they heard He was.
Mark	Mark	41	6	56	Wherever He entered villages, or cities, or countryside, they were laying the sick in the market places, and imploring Him that they might just touch the fringe of His cloak; and as many as touched it were being cured.
Mark	Mark	41	7	1	The Pharisees and some of the scribes gathered around Him when they had come from Jerusalem,
Mark	Mark	41	7	2	and had seen that some of His disciples were eating their bread with impure hands, that is, unwashed.
Mark	Mark	41	7	3	(For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they carefully wash their hands, thus observing the traditions of the elders;
Mark	Mark	41	7	4	and when they come from the market place, they do not eat unless they cleanse themselves; and there are many other things which they have received in order to observe, such as the washing of cups and pitchers and copper pots.)
Mark	Mark	41	7	5	The Pharisees and the scribes *asked Him, "Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with impure hands?"
Mark	Mark	41	7	6	And He said to them, "Rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written: 'THIS PEOPLE HONORS ME WITH THEIR LIPS, BUT THEIR HEART IS FAR AWAY FROM ME.
Mark	Mark	41	7	7	'BUT IN VAIN DO THEY WORSHIP ME, TEACHING AS DOCTRINES THE PRECEPTS OF MEN.'
Mark	Mark	41	7	8	"Neglecting the commandment of God, you hold to the tradition of men."
Mark	Mark	41	7	9	He was also saying to them, "You are experts at setting aside the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition.
Mark	Mark	41	7	10	"For Moses said, 'HONOR YOUR FATHER AND YOUR MOTHER'; and, 'HE WHO SPEAKS EVIL OF FATHER OR MOTHER, IS TO BE PUT TO DEATH';
Mark	Mark	41	7	11	but you say, 'If a man says to his father or his mother, whatever I have that would help you is Corban (that is to say, given to God),'
Mark	Mark	41	7	12	you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or his mother;
Mark	Mark	41	7	13	thus invalidating the word of God by your tradition which you have handed down; and you do many things such as that."
Mark	Mark	41	7	14	After He called the crowd to Him again, He began saying to them, "Listen to Me, all of you, and understand:
Mark	Mark	41	7	15	there is nothing outside the man which can defile him if it goes into him; but the things which proceed out of the man are what defile the man.
Mark	Mark	41	7	16	["If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear."]
Mark	Mark	41	7	17	When he had left the crowd and entered the house, His disciples questioned Him about the parable.
Mark	Mark	41	7	18	And He *said to them, "Are you so lacking in understanding also? Do you not understand that whatever goes into the man from outside cannot defile him,
Mark	Mark	41	7	19	because it does not go into his heart, but into his stomach, and is eliminated?" (Thus He declared all foods clean.)
Mark	Mark	41	7	20	And He was saying, "That which proceeds out of the man, that is what defiles the man.
Mark	Mark	41	7	21	"For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed the evil thoughts, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries,
Mark	Mark	41	7	22	deeds of coveting and wickedness, as well as deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride and foolishness.
Mark	Mark	41	7	23	"All these evil things proceed from within and defile the man."
Mark	Mark	41	7	24	Jesus got up and went away from there to the region of Tyre. And when He had entered a house, He wanted no one to know of it; yet He could not escape notice.
Mark	Mark	41	7	25	But after hearing of Him, a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit immediately came and fell at His feet.
Mark	Mark	41	7	26	Now the woman was a Gentile, of the Syrophoenician race. And she kept asking Him to cast the demon out of her daughter.
Mark	Mark	41	7	27	And He was saying to her, "Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
Mark	Mark	41	7	28	But she answered and *said to Him, "Yes, Lord, but even the dogs under the table feed on the children's crumbs."
Mark	Mark	41	7	29	And He said to her, "Because of this answer go; the demon has gone out of your daughter."
Mark	Mark	41	7	30	And going back to her home, she found the child lying on the bed, the demon having left.
Mark	Mark	41	7	31	Again He went out from the region of Tyre, and came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, within the region of Decapolis.
Mark	Mark	41	7	32	They *brought to Him one who was deaf and spoke with difficulty, and they *implored Him to lay His hand on him.
Mark	Mark	41	7	33	Jesus took him aside from the crowd, by himself, and put His fingers into his ears, and after spitting, He touched his tongue with the saliva;
Mark	Mark	41	7	34	and looking up to heaven with a deep sigh, He *said to him, "Ephphatha!" that is, "Be opened!"
Mark	Mark	41	7	35	And his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was removed, and he began speaking plainly.
Mark	Mark	41	7	36	And He gave them orders not to tell anyone; but the more He ordered them, the more widely they continued to proclaim it.
Mark	Mark	41	7	37	They were utterly astonished, saying, "He has done all things well; He makes even the deaf to hear and the mute to speak."
Mark	Mark	41	8	1	In those days, when there was again a large crowd and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called His disciples and *said to them,
Mark	Mark	41	8	2	"I feel compassion for the people because they have remained with Me now three days and have nothing to eat.
Mark	Mark	41	8	3	"If I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint on the way; and some of them have come from a great distance."
Mark	Mark	41	8	4	And His disciples answered Him, "Where will anyone be able to find enough bread here in this desolate place to satisfy these people?"
Mark	Mark	41	8	5	And He was asking them, "How many loaves do you have?" And they said, "Seven."
Mark	Mark	41	8	6	And He *directed the people to sit down on the ground; and taking the seven loaves, He gave thanks and broke them, and started giving them to His disciples to serve to them, and they served them to the people.
Mark	Mark	41	8	7	They also had a few small fish; and after He had blessed them, He ordered these to be served as well.
Mark	Mark	41	8	8	And they ate and were satisfied; and they picked up seven large baskets full of what was left over of the broken pieces.
Mark	Mark	41	8	9	About four thousand were there; and He sent them away.
Mark	Mark	41	8	10	And immediately He entered the boat with His disciples and came to the district of Dalmanutha.
Mark	Mark	41	8	11	The Pharisees came out and began to argue with Him, seeking from Him a sign from heaven, to test Him.
Mark	Mark	41	8	12	Sighing deeply in His spirit, He *said, "Why does this generation seek for a sign? Truly I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation."
Mark	Mark	41	8	13	Leaving them, He again embarked and went away to the other side.
Mark	Mark	41	8	14	And they had forgotten to take bread, and did not have more than one loaf in the boat with them.
Mark	Mark	41	8	15	And He was giving orders to them, saying, "Watch out! Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod."
Mark	Mark	41	8	16	They began to discuss with one another the fact that they had no bread.
Mark	Mark	41	8	17	And Jesus, aware of this, *said to them, "Why do you discuss the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet see or understand? Do you have a hardened heart?
Mark	Mark	41	8	18	"HAVING EYES, DO YOU NOT SEE? AND HAVING EARS, DO YOU NOT HEAR? And do you not remember,
Mark	Mark	41	8	19	when I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces you picked up?" They *said to Him, "Twelve."
Mark	Mark	41	8	20	"When I broke the seven for the four thousand, how many large baskets full of broken pieces did you pick up?" And they *said to Him, "Seven."
Mark	Mark	41	8	21	And He was saying to them, "Do you not yet understand?"
Mark	Mark	41	8	22	And they *came to Bethsaida. And they *brought a blind man to Jesus and *implored Him to touch him.
Mark	Mark	41	8	23	Taking the blind man by the hand, He brought him out of the village; and after spitting on his eyes and laying His hands on him, He asked him, "Do you see anything?"
Mark	Mark	41	8	24	And he looked up and said, "I see men, for I see them like trees, walking around."
Mark	Mark	41	8	25	Then again He laid His hands on his eyes; and he looked intently and was restored, and began to see everything clearly.
Mark	Mark	41	8	26	And He sent him to his home, saying, "Do not even enter the village."
Mark	Mark	41	8	27	Jesus went out, along with His disciples, to the villages of Caesarea Philippi; and on the way He questioned His disciples, saying to them, "Who do people say that I am?"
Mark	Mark	41	8	28	They told Him, saying, "John the Baptist; and others say Elijah; but others, one of the prophets."
Mark	Mark	41	8	29	And He continued by questioning them, "But who do you say that I am?" Peter *answered and *said to Him, "You are the Christ."
Mark	Mark	41	8	30	And He warned them to tell no one about Him.
Mark	Mark	41	8	31	And He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.
Mark	Mark	41	8	32	And He was stating the matter plainly. And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him.
Mark	Mark	41	8	33	But turning around and seeing His disciples, He rebuked Peter and *said, "Get behind Me, Satan; for you are not setting your mind on God's interests, but man's."
Mark	Mark	41	8	34	And He summoned the crowd with His disciples, and said to them, "If anyone wishes to come after Me, he must deny himself, and take up his cross and follow Me.
Mark	Mark	41	8	35	"For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake and the gospel's will save it.
Mark	Mark	41	8	36	"For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world, and forfeit his soul?
Mark	Mark	41	8	37	"For what will a man give in exchange for his soul?
Mark	Mark	41	8	38	"For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels."
Mark	Mark	41	9	1	And Jesus was saying to them, "Truly I say to you, there are some of those who are standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God after it has come with power."
Mark	Mark	41	9	2	Six days later, Jesus *took with Him Peter and James and John, and *brought them up on a high mountain by themselves. And He was transfigured before them;
Mark	Mark	41	9	3	and His garments became radiant and exceedingly white, as no launderer on earth can whiten them.
Mark	Mark	41	9	4	Elijah appeared to them along with Moses; and they were talking with Jesus.
Mark	Mark	41	9	5	Peter *said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; let us make three tabernacles, one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
Mark	Mark	41	9	6	For he did not know what to answer; for they became terrified.
Mark	Mark	41	9	7	Then a cloud formed, overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, "This is My beloved Son, listen to Him!"
Mark	Mark	41	9	8	All at once they looked around and saw no one with them anymore, except Jesus alone.
Mark	Mark	41	9	9	As they were coming down from the mountain, He gave them orders not to relate to anyone what they had seen, until the Son of Man rose from the dead.
Mark	Mark	41	9	10	They seized upon that statement, discussing with one another what rising from the dead meant.
Mark	Mark	41	9	11	They asked Him, saying, "Why is it that the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
Mark	Mark	41	9	12	And He said to them, "Elijah does first come and restore all things. And yet how is it written of the Son of Man that He will suffer many things and be treated with contempt?
Mark	Mark	41	9	13	"But I say to you that Elijah has indeed come, and they did to him whatever they wished, just as it is written of him."
Mark	Mark	41	9	14	When they came back to the disciples, they saw a large crowd around them, and some scribes arguing with them.
Mark	Mark	41	9	15	Immediately, when the entire crowd saw Him, they were amazed and began running up to greet Him.
Mark	Mark	41	9	16	And He asked them, "What are you discussing with them?"
Mark	Mark	41	9	17	And one of the crowd answered Him, "Teacher, I brought You my son, possessed with a spirit which makes him mute;
Mark	Mark	41	9	18	and whenever it seizes him, it slams him to the ground and he foams at the mouth, and grinds his teeth and stiffens out. I told Your disciples to cast it out, and they could not do it."
Mark	Mark	41	9	19	And He *answered them and *said, "O unbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring him to Me!"
Mark	Mark	41	9	20	They brought the boy to Him. When he saw Him, immediately the spirit threw him into a convulsion, and falling to the ground, he began rolling around and foaming at the mouth.
Mark	Mark	41	9	21	And He asked his father, "How long has this been happening to him?" And he said, "From childhood.
Mark	Mark	41	9	22	"It has often thrown him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him. But if You can do anything, take pity on us and help us!"
Mark	Mark	41	9	23	And Jesus said to him, " 'If You can?' All things are possible to him who believes."
Mark	Mark	41	9	24	Immediately the boy's father cried out and said, "I do believe; help my unbelief."
Mark	Mark	41	9	25	When Jesus saw that a crowd was rapidly gathering, He rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, "You deaf and mute spirit, I command you, come out of him and do not enter him again."
Mark	Mark	41	9	26	After crying out and throwing him into terrible convulsions, it came out; and the boy became so much like a corpse that most of them said, "He is dead!"
Mark	Mark	41	9	27	But Jesus took him by the hand and raised him; and he got up.
Mark	Mark	41	9	28	When He came into the house, His disciples began questioning Him privately, "Why could we not drive it out?"
Mark	Mark	41	9	29	And He said to them, "This kind cannot come out by anything but prayer."
Mark	Mark	41	9	30	From there they went out and began to go through Galilee, and He did not want anyone to know about it.
Mark	Mark	41	9	31	For He was teaching His disciples and telling them, "The Son of Man is to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill Him; and when He has been killed, He will rise three days later."
Mark	Mark	41	9	32	But they did not understand this statement, and they were afraid to ask Him.
Mark	Mark	41	9	33	They came to Capernaum; and when He was in the house, He began to question them, "What were you discussing on the way?"
Mark	Mark	41	9	34	But they kept silent, for on the way they had discussed with one another which of them was the greatest.
Mark	Mark	41	9	35	Sitting down, He called the twelve and *said to them, "If anyone wants to be first, he shall be last of all and servant of all."
Mark	Mark	41	9	36	Taking a child, He set him before them, and taking him in His arms, He said to them,
Mark	Mark	41	9	37	"Whoever receives one child like this in My name receives Me; and whoever receives Me does not receive Me, but Him who sent Me."
Mark	Mark	41	9	38	John said to Him, "Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, and we tried to prevent him because he was not following us."
Mark	Mark	41	9	39	But Jesus said, "Do not hinder him, for there is no one who will perform a miracle in My name, and be able soon afterward to speak evil of Me.
Mark	Mark	41	9	40	"For he who is not against us is for us.
Mark	Mark	41	9	41	"For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because of your name as followers of Christ, truly I say to you, he will not lose his reward.
Mark	Mark	41	9	42	"Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe to stumble, it would be better for him if, with a heavy millstone hung around his neck, he had been cast into the sea.
Mark	Mark	41	9	43	"If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life crippled, than, having your two hands, to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire,
Mark	Mark	41	9	44	[where THEIR WORM DOES NOT DIE, AND THE FIRE IS NOT QUENCHED.]
Mark	Mark	41	9	45	"If your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life lame, than, having your two feet, to be cast into hell,
Mark	Mark	41	9	46	[where THEIR WORM DOES NOT DIE, AND THE FIRE IS NOT QUENCHED.]
Mark	Mark	41	9	47	"If your eye causes you to stumble, throw it out; it is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye, than, having two eyes, to be cast into hell,
Mark	Mark	41	9	48	where THEIR WORM DOES NOT DIE, AND THE FIRE IS NOT QUENCHED.
Mark	Mark	41	9	49	"For everyone will be salted with fire.
Mark	Mark	41	9	50	"Salt is good; but if the salt becomes unsalty, with what will you make it salty again? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another."
Mark	Mark	41	10	1	Getting up, He *went from there to the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan; crowds *gathered around Him again, and, according to His custom, He once more began to teach them.
Mark	Mark	41	10	2	Some Pharisees came up to Jesus, testing Him, and began to question Him whether it was lawful for a man to divorce a wife.
Mark	Mark	41	10	3	And He answered and said to them, "What did Moses command you?"
Mark	Mark	41	10	4	They said, "Moses permitted a man TO WRITE A CERTIFICATE OF DIVORCE AND SEND her AWAY."
Mark	Mark	41	10	5	But Jesus said to them, "Because of your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment.
Mark	Mark	41	10	6	"But from the beginning of creation, God MADE THEM MALE AND FEMALE.
Mark	Mark	41	10	7	"FOR THIS REASON A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER,
Mark	Mark	41	10	8	AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH; so they are no longer two, but one flesh.
Mark	Mark	41	10	9	"What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate."
Mark	Mark	41	10	10	In the house the disciples began questioning Him about this again.
Mark	Mark	41	10	11	And He *said to them, "Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her;
Mark	Mark	41	10	12	and if she herself divorces her husband and marries another man, she is committing adultery."
Mark	Mark	41	10	13	And they were bringing children to Him so that He might touch them; but the disciples rebuked them.
Mark	Mark	41	10	14	But when Jesus saw this, He was indignant and said to them, "Permit the children to come to Me; do not hinder them; for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
Mark	Mark	41	10	15	"Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it at all."
Mark	Mark	41	10	16	And He took them in His arms and began blessing them, laying His hands on them.
Mark	Mark	41	10	17	As He was setting out on a journey, a man ran up to Him and knelt before Him, and asked Him, "Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
Mark	Mark	41	10	18	And Jesus said to him, "Why do you call Me good? No one is good except God alone.
Mark	Mark	41	10	19	"You know the commandments, 'DO NOT MURDER, DO NOT COMMIT ADULTERY, DO NOT STEAL, DO NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS, Do not defraud, HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER.'"
Mark	Mark	41	10	20	And he said to Him, "Teacher, I have kept all these things from my youth up."
Mark	Mark	41	10	21	Looking at him, Jesus felt a love for him and said to him, "One thing you lack: go and sell all you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me."
Mark	Mark	41	10	22	But at these words he was saddened, and he went away grieving, for he was one who owned much property.
Mark	Mark	41	10	23	And Jesus, looking around, *said to His disciples, "How hard it will be for those who are wealthy to enter the kingdom of God!"
Mark	Mark	41	10	24	The disciples were amazed at His words. But Jesus *answered again and *said to them, "Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!
Mark	Mark	41	10	25	"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."
Mark	Mark	41	10	26	They were even more astonished and said to Him, "Then who can be saved?"
Mark	Mark	41	10	27	Looking at them, Jesus *said, "With people it is impossible, but not with God; for all things are possible with God."
Mark	Mark	41	10	28	Peter began to say to Him, "Behold, we have left everything and followed You."
Mark	Mark	41	10	29	Jesus said, "Truly I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or farms, for My sake and for the gospel's sake,
Mark	Mark	41	10	30	but that he will receive a hundred times as much now in the present age, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and farms, along with persecutions; and in the age to come, eternal life.
Mark	Mark	41	10	31	"But many who are first will be last, and the last, first."
Mark	Mark	41	10	32	They were on the road going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking on ahead of them; and they were amazed, and those who followed were fearful. And again He took the twelve aside and began to tell them what was going to happen to Him,
Mark	Mark	41	10	33	saying, "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes; and they will condemn Him to death and will hand Him over to the Gentiles.
Mark	Mark	41	10	34	"They will mock Him and spit on Him, and scourge Him and kill Him, and three days later He will rise again."
Mark	Mark	41	10	35	James and John, the two sons of Zebedee, *came up to Jesus, saying, "Teacher, we want You to do for us whatever we ask of You."
Mark	Mark	41	10	36	And He said to them, "What do you want Me to do for you?"
Mark	Mark	41	10	37	They said to Him, "Grant that we may sit, one on Your right and one on Your left, in Your glory."
Mark	Mark	41	10	38	But Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?"
Mark	Mark	41	10	39	They said to Him, "We are able." And Jesus said to them, "The cup that I drink you shall drink; and you shall be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized.
Mark	Mark	41	10	40	"But to sit on My right or on My left, this is not Mine to give; but it is for those for whom it has been prepared."
Mark	Mark	41	10	41	Hearing this, the ten began to feel indignant with James and John.
Mark	Mark	41	10	42	Calling them to Himself, Jesus *said to them, "You know that those who are recognized as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them; and their great men exercise authority over them.
Mark	Mark	41	10	43	"But it is not this way among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant;
Mark	Mark	41	10	44	and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be slave of all.
Mark	Mark	41	10	45	"For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many."
Mark	Mark	41	10	46	Then they *came to Jericho. And as He was leaving Jericho with His disciples and a large crowd, a blind beggar named Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the road.
Mark	Mark	41	10	47	When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out and say, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"
Mark	Mark	41	10	48	Many were sternly telling him to be quiet, but he kept crying out all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"
Mark	Mark	41	10	49	And Jesus stopped and said, "Call him here." So they *called the blind man, saying to him, "Take courage, stand up! He is calling for you."
Mark	Mark	41	10	50	Throwing aside his cloak, he jumped up and came to Jesus.
Mark	Mark	41	10	51	And answering him, Jesus said, "What do you want Me to do for you?" And the blind man said to Him, "Rabboni, I want to regain my sight!"
Mark	Mark	41	10	52	And Jesus said to him, "Go; your faith has made you well." Immediately he regained his sight and began following Him on the road.
Mark	Mark	41	11	1	As they *approached Jerusalem, at Bethphage and Bethany, near the Mount of Olives, He *sent two of His disciples,
Mark	Mark	41	11	2	and *said to them, "Go into the village opposite you, and immediately as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, on which no one yet has ever sat; untie it and bring it here.
Mark	Mark	41	11	3	"If anyone says to you, 'Why are you doing this?' you say, 'The Lord has need of it'; and immediately he will send it back here."
Mark	Mark	41	11	4	They went away and found a colt tied at the door, outside in the street; and they *untied it.
Mark	Mark	41	11	5	Some of the bystanders were saying to them, "What are you doing, untying the colt?"
Mark	Mark	41	11	6	They spoke to them just as Jesus had told them, and they gave them permission.
Mark	Mark	41	11	7	They *brought the colt to Jesus and put their coats on it; and He sat on it.
Mark	Mark	41	11	8	And many spread their coats in the road, and others spread leafy branches which they had cut from the fields.
Mark	Mark	41	11	9	Those who went in front and those who followed were shouting: "Hosanna! BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD;
Mark	Mark	41	11	10	Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David; Hosanna in the highest!"
Mark	Mark	41	11	11	Jesus entered Jerusalem and came into the temple; and after looking around at everything, He left for Bethany with the twelve, since it was already late.
Mark	Mark	41	11	12	On the next day, when they had left Bethany, He became hungry.
Mark	Mark	41	11	13	Seeing at a distance a fig tree in leaf, He went to see if perhaps He would find anything on it; and when He came to it, He found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.
Mark	Mark	41	11	14	He said to it, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again!" And His disciples were listening.
Mark	Mark	41	11	15	Then they *came to Jerusalem. And He entered the temple and began to drive out those who were buying and selling in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling doves;
Mark	Mark	41	11	16	and He would not permit anyone to carry merchandise through the temple.
Mark	Mark	41	11	17	And He began to teach and say to them, "Is it not written, 'MY HOUSE SHALL BE CALLED A HOUSE OF PRAYER FOR ALL THE NATIONS'? But you have made it a ROBBERS' DEN."
Mark	Mark	41	11	18	The chief priests and the scribes heard this, and began seeking how to destroy Him; for they were afraid of Him, for the whole crowd was astonished at His teaching.
Mark	Mark	41	11	19	When evening came, they would go out of the city.
Mark	Mark	41	11	20	As they were passing by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots up.
Mark	Mark	41	11	21	Being reminded, Peter *said to Him, "Rabbi, look, the fig tree which You cursed has withered."
Mark	Mark	41	11	22	And Jesus *answered saying to them, "Have faith in God.
Mark	Mark	41	11	23	"Truly I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says is going to happen, it will be granted him.
Mark	Mark	41	11	24	"Therefore I say to you, all things for which you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and they will be granted you.
Mark	Mark	41	11	25	"Whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father who is in heaven will also forgive you your transgressions.
Mark	Mark	41	11	26	["But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your transgressions."]
Mark	Mark	41	11	27	They *came again to Jerusalem. And as He was walking in the temple, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders *came to Him,
Mark	Mark	41	11	28	and began saying to Him, "By what authority are You doing these things, or who gave You this authority to do these things?"
Mark	Mark	41	11	29	And Jesus said to them, "I will ask you one question, and you answer Me, and then I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
Mark	Mark	41	11	30	"Was the baptism of John from heaven, or from men? Answer Me."
Mark	Mark	41	11	31	They began reasoning among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' He will say, 'Then why did you not believe him?'
Mark	Mark	41	11	32	"But shall we say, 'From men'?"--they were afraid of the people, for everyone considered John to have been a real prophet.
Mark	Mark	41	11	33	Answering Jesus, they *said, "We do not know." And Jesus *said to them, "Nor will I tell you by what authority I do these things."
Mark	Mark	41	12	1	And He began to speak to them in parables: "A man PLANTED A VINEYARD AND PUT A WALL AROUND IT, AND DUG A VAT UNDER THE WINE PRESS AND BUILT A TOWER, and rented it out to vine-growers and went on a journey.
Mark	Mark	41	12	2	"At the harvest time he sent a slave to the vine-growers, in order to receive some of the produce of the vineyard from the vine-growers.
Mark	Mark	41	12	3	"They took him, and beat him and sent him away empty-handed.
Mark	Mark	41	12	4	"Again he sent them another slave, and they wounded him in the head, and treated him shamefully.
Mark	Mark	41	12	5	"And he sent another, and that one they killed; and so with many others, beating some and killing others.
Mark	Mark	41	12	6	"He had one more to send, a beloved son; he sent him last of all to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.'
Mark	Mark	41	12	7	"But those vine-growers said to one another, 'This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours!'
Mark	Mark	41	12	8	"They took him, and killed him and threw him out of the vineyard.
Mark	Mark	41	12	9	"What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the vine-growers, and will give the vineyard to others.
Mark	Mark	41	12	10	"Have you not even read this Scripture: 'THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED, THIS BECAME THE CHIEF CORNER stone;
Mark	Mark	41	12	11	THIS CAME ABOUT FROM THE LORD, AND IT IS MARVELOUS IN OUR EYES'?"
Mark	Mark	41	12	12	And they were seeking to seize Him, and yet they feared the people, for they understood that He spoke the parable against them. And so they left Him and went away.
Mark	Mark	41	12	13	Then they *sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Him in order to trap Him in a statement.
Mark	Mark	41	12	14	They *came and *said to Him, "Teacher, we know that You are truthful and defer to no one; for You are not partial to any, but teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to pay a poll-tax to Caesar, or not?
Mark	Mark	41	12	15	"Shall we pay or shall we not pay?" But He, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, "Why are you testing Me? Bring Me a denarius to look at."
Mark	Mark	41	12	16	They brought one. And He *said to them, "Whose likeness and inscription is this?" And they said to Him, "Caesar's."
Mark	Mark	41	12	17	And Jesus said to them, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." And they were amazed at Him.
Mark	Mark	41	12	18	Some Sadducees (who say that there is no resurrection) *came to Jesus, and began questioning Him, saying,
Mark	Mark	41	12	19	"Teacher, Moses wrote for us that IF A MAN'S BROTHER DIES and leaves behind a wife AND LEAVES NO CHILD, HIS BROTHER SHOULD MARRY THE WIFE AND RAISE UP CHILDREN TO HIS BROTHER.
Mark	Mark	41	12	20	"There were seven brothers; and the first took a wife, and died leaving no children.
Mark	Mark	41	12	21	"The second one married her, and died leaving behind no children; and the third likewise;
Mark	Mark	41	12	22	and so all seven left no children. Last of all the woman died also.
Mark	Mark	41	12	23	"In the resurrection, when they rise again, which one's wife will she be? For all seven had married her."
Mark	Mark	41	12	24	Jesus said to them, "Is this not the reason you are mistaken, that you do not understand the Scriptures or the power of God?
Mark	Mark	41	12	25	"For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.
Mark	Mark	41	12	26	"But regarding the fact that the dead rise again, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the burning bush, how God spoke to him, saying, 'I AM THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, AND THE GOD OF ISAAC, and the God of Jacob'?
Mark	Mark	41	12	27	"He is not the God of the dead, but of the living; you are greatly mistaken."
Mark	Mark	41	12	28	One of the scribes came and heard them arguing, and recognizing that He had answered them well, asked Him, "What commandment is the foremost of all?"
Mark	Mark	41	12	29	Jesus answered, "The foremost is, 'HEAR, O ISRAEL! THE LORD OUR GOD IS ONE LORD;
Mark	Mark	41	12	30	AND YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND, AND WITH ALL YOUR STRENGTH.'
Mark	Mark	41	12	31	"The second is this, 'YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.' There is no other commandment greater than these."
Mark	Mark	41	12	32	The scribe said to Him, "Right, Teacher; You have truly stated that HE IS ONE, AND THERE IS NO ONE ELSE BESIDES HIM;
Mark	Mark	41	12	33	AND TO LOVE HIM WITH ALL THE HEART AND WITH ALL THE UNDERSTANDING AND WITH ALL THE STRENGTH, AND TO LOVE ONE'S NEIGHBOR AS HIMSELF, is much more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices."
Mark	Mark	41	12	34	When Jesus saw that he had answered intelligently, He said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God." After that, no one would venture to ask Him any more questions.
Mark	Mark	41	12	35	And Jesus began to say, as He taught in the temple, "How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?
Mark	Mark	41	12	36	"David himself said in the Holy Spirit, 'THE LORD SAID TO MY LORD, "SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND, UNTIL I PUT YOUR ENEMIES BENEATH YOUR FEET."'
Mark	Mark	41	12	37	"David himself calls Him 'Lord'; so in what sense is He his son?" And the large crowd enjoyed listening to Him.
Mark	Mark	41	12	38	In His teaching He was saying: "Beware of the scribes who like to walk around in long robes, and like respectful greetings in the market places,
Mark	Mark	41	12	39	and chief seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets,
Mark	Mark	41	12	40	who devour widows' houses, and for appearance's sake offer long prayers; these will receive greater condemnation."
Mark	Mark	41	12	41	And He sat down opposite the treasury, and began observing how the people were putting money into the treasury; and many rich people were putting in large sums.
Mark	Mark	41	12	42	A poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which amount to a cent.
Mark	Mark	41	12	43	Calling His disciples to Him, He said to them, "Truly I say to you, this poor widow put in more than all the contributors to the treasury;
Mark	Mark	41	12	44	for they all put in out of their surplus, but she, out of her poverty, put in all she owned, all she had to live on."
Mark	Mark	41	13	1	As He was going out of the temple, one of His disciples *said to Him, "Teacher, behold what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings!"
Mark	Mark	41	13	2	And Jesus said to him, "Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone will be left upon another which will not be torn down."
Mark	Mark	41	13	3	As He was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew were questioning Him privately,
Mark	Mark	41	13	4	"Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign when all these things are going to be fulfilled?"
Mark	Mark	41	13	5	And Jesus began to say to them, "See to it that no one misleads you.
Mark	Mark	41	13	6	"Many will come in My name, saying, 'I am He!' and will mislead many.
Mark	Mark	41	13	7	"When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be frightened; those things must take place; but that is not yet the end.
Mark	Mark	41	13	8	"For nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in various places; there will also be famines. These things are merely the beginning of birth pangs.
Mark	Mark	41	13	9	"But be on your guard; for they will deliver you to the courts, and you will be flogged in the synagogues, and you will stand before governors and kings for My sake, as a testimony to them.
Mark	Mark	41	13	10	"The gospel must first be preached to all the nations.
Mark	Mark	41	13	11	"When they arrest you and hand you over, do not worry beforehand about what you are to say, but say whatever is given you in that hour; for it is not you who speak, but it is the Holy Spirit.
Mark	Mark	41	13	12	"Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and have them put to death.
Mark	Mark	41	13	13	"You will be hated by all because of My name, but the one who endures to the end, he will be saved.
Mark	Mark	41	13	14	"But when you see the ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION standing where it should not be (let the reader understand), then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains.
Mark	Mark	41	13	15	"The one who is on the housetop must not go down, or go in to get anything out of his house;
Mark	Mark	41	13	16	and the one who is in the field must not turn back to get his coat.
Mark	Mark	41	13	17	"But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days!
Mark	Mark	41	13	18	"But pray that it may not happen in the winter.
Mark	Mark	41	13	19	"For those days will be a time of tribulation such as has not occurred since the beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never will.
Mark	Mark	41	13	20	"Unless the Lord had shortened those days, no life would have been saved; but for the sake of the elect, whom He chose, He shortened the days.
Mark	Mark	41	13	21	"And then if anyone says to you, 'Behold, here is the Christ'; or, 'Behold, He is there'; do not believe him;
Mark	Mark	41	13	22	for false Christs and false prophets will arise, and will show signs and wonders, in order to lead astray, if possible, the elect.
Mark	Mark	41	13	23	"But take heed; behold, I have told you everything in advance.
Mark	Mark	41	13	24	"But in those days, after that tribulation, THE SUN WILL BE DARKENED AND THE MOON WILL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT,
Mark	Mark	41	13	25	AND THE STARS WILL BE FALLING from heaven, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken.
Mark	Mark	41	13	26	"Then they will see THE SON OF MAN COMING IN CLOUDS with great power and glory.
Mark	Mark	41	13	27	"And then He will send forth the angels, and will gather together His elect from the four winds, from the farthest end of the earth to the farthest end of heaven.
Mark	Mark	41	13	28	"Now learn the parable from the fig tree: when its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near.
Mark	Mark	41	13	29	"Even so, you too, when you see these things happening, recognize that He is near, right at the door.
Mark	Mark	41	13	30	"Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.
Mark	Mark	41	13	31	"Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away.
Mark	Mark	41	13	32	"But of that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone.
Mark	Mark	41	13	33	"Take heed, keep on the alert; for you do not know when the appointed time will come.
Mark	Mark	41	13	34	"It is like a man away on a journey, who upon leaving his house and putting his slaves in charge, assigning to each one his task, also commanded the doorkeeper to stay on the alert.
Mark	Mark	41	13	35	"Therefore, be on the alert--for you do not know when the master of the house is coming, whether in the evening, at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in the morning--
Mark	Mark	41	13	36	in case he should come suddenly and find you asleep.
Mark	Mark	41	13	37	"What I say to you I say to all, 'Be on the alert!'"
Mark	Mark	41	14	1	Now the Passover and Unleavened Bread were two days away; and the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to seize Him by stealth and kill Him;
Mark	Mark	41	14	2	for they were saying, "Not during the festival, otherwise there might be a riot of the people."
Mark	Mark	41	14	3	While He was in Bethany at the home of Simon the leper, and reclining at the table, there came a woman with an alabaster vial of very costly perfume of pure nard; and she broke the vial and poured it over His head.
Mark	Mark	41	14	4	But some were indignantly remarking to one another, "Why has this perfume been wasted?
Mark	Mark	41	14	5	"For this perfume might have been sold for over three hundred denarii, and the money given to the poor." And they were scolding her.
Mark	Mark	41	14	6	But Jesus said, "Let her alone; why do you bother her? She has done a good deed to Me.
Mark	Mark	41	14	7	"For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you wish you can do good to them; but you do not always have Me.
Mark	Mark	41	14	8	"She has done what she could; she has anointed My body beforehand for the burial.
Mark	Mark	41	14	9	"Truly I say to you, wherever the gospel is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be spoken of in memory of her."
Mark	Mark	41	14	10	Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went off to the chief priests in order to betray Him to them.
Mark	Mark	41	14	11	They were glad when they heard this, and promised to give him money. And he began seeking how to betray Him at an opportune time.
Mark	Mark	41	14	12	On the first day of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb was being sacrificed, His disciples *said to Him, "Where do You want us to go and prepare for You to eat the Passover?"
Mark	Mark	41	14	13	And He *sent two of His disciples and *said to them, "Go into the city, and a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him;
Mark	Mark	41	14	14	and wherever he enters, say to the owner of the house, 'The Teacher says, "Where is My guest room in which I may eat the Passover with My disciples?"'
Mark	Mark	41	14	15	"And he himself will show you a large upper room furnished and ready; prepare for us there."
Mark	Mark	41	14	16	The disciples went out and came to the city, and found it just as He had told them; and they prepared the Passover.
Mark	Mark	41	14	17	When it was evening He *came with the twelve.
Mark	Mark	41	14	18	As they were reclining at the table and eating, Jesus said, "Truly I say to you that one of you will betray Me--one who is eating with Me."
Mark	Mark	41	14	19	They began to be grieved and to say to Him one by one, "Surely not I?"
Mark	Mark	41	14	20	And He said to them, "It is one of the twelve, one who dips with Me in the bowl.
Mark	Mark	41	14	21	"For the Son of Man is to go just as it is written of Him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born."
Mark	Mark	41	14	22	While they were eating, He took some bread, and after a blessing He broke it, and gave it to them, and said, "Take it; this is My body."
Mark	Mark	41	14	23	And when He had taken a cup and given thanks, He gave it to them, and they all drank from it.
Mark	Mark	41	14	24	And He said to them, "This is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.
Mark	Mark	41	14	25	"Truly I say to you, I will never again drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God."
Mark	Mark	41	14	26	After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
Mark	Mark	41	14	27	And Jesus *said to them, "You will all fall away, because it is written, 'I WILL STRIKE DOWN THE SHEPHERD, AND THE SHEEP SHALL BE SCATTERED.'
Mark	Mark	41	14	28	"But after I have been raised, I will go ahead of you to Galilee."
Mark	Mark	41	14	29	But Peter said to Him, "Even though all may fall away, yet I will not."
Mark	Mark	41	14	30	And Jesus *said to him, "Truly I say to you, that this very night, before a rooster crows twice, you yourself will deny Me three times."
Mark	Mark	41	14	31	But Peter kept saying insistently, "Even if I have to die with You, I will not deny You!" And they all were saying the same thing also.
Mark	Mark	41	14	32	They *came to a place named Gethsemane; and He *said to His disciples, "Sit here until I have prayed."
Mark	Mark	41	14	33	And He *took with Him Peter and James and John, and began to be very distressed and troubled.
Mark	Mark	41	14	34	And He *said to them, "My soul is deeply grieved to the point of death; remain here and keep watch."
Mark	Mark	41	14	35	And He went a little beyond them, and fell to the ground and began to pray that if it were possible, the hour might pass Him by.
Mark	Mark	41	14	36	And He was saying, "Abba! Father! All things are possible for You; remove this cup from Me; yet not what I will, but what You will."
Mark	Mark	41	14	37	And He *came and *found them sleeping, and *said to Peter, "Simon, are you asleep? Could you not keep watch for one hour?
Mark	Mark	41	14	38	"Keep watching and praying that you may not come into temptation; the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."
Mark	Mark	41	14	39	Again He went away and prayed, saying the same words.
Mark	Mark	41	14	40	And again He came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they did not know what to answer Him.
Mark	Mark	41	14	41	And He *came the third time, and *said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? It is enough; the hour has come; behold, the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.
Mark	Mark	41	14	42	"Get up, let us be going; behold, the one who betrays Me is at hand!"
Mark	Mark	41	14	43	Immediately while He was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, *came up accompanied by a crowd with swords and clubs, who were from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
Mark	Mark	41	14	44	Now he who was betraying Him had given them a signal, saying, "Whomever I kiss, He is the one; seize Him and lead Him away under guard."
Mark	Mark	41	14	45	After coming, Judas immediately went to Him, saying, "Rabbi!" and kissed Him.
Mark	Mark	41	14	46	They laid hands on Him and seized Him.
Mark	Mark	41	14	47	But one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his ear.
Mark	Mark	41	14	48	And Jesus said to them, "Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me, as you would against a robber?
Mark	Mark	41	14	49	"Every day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not seize Me; but this has taken place to fulfill the Scriptures."
Mark	Mark	41	14	50	And they all left Him and fled.
Mark	Mark	41	14	51	A young man was following Him, wearing nothing but a linen sheet over his naked body; and they *seized him.
Mark	Mark	41	14	52	But he pulled free of the linen sheet and escaped naked.
Mark	Mark	41	14	53	They led Jesus away to the high priest; and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes *gathered together.
Mark	Mark	41	14	54	Peter had followed Him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest; and he was sitting with the officers and warming himself at the fire.
Mark	Mark	41	14	55	Now the chief priests and the whole Council kept trying to obtain testimony against Jesus to put Him to death, and they were not finding any.
Mark	Mark	41	14	56	For many were giving false testimony against Him, but their testimony was not consistent.
Mark	Mark	41	14	57	Some stood up and began to give false testimony against Him, saying,
Mark	Mark	41	14	58	"We heard Him say, 'I will destroy this temple made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.'"
Mark	Mark	41	14	59	Not even in this respect was their testimony consistent.
Mark	Mark	41	14	60	The high priest stood up and came forward and questioned Jesus, saying, "Do You not answer? What is it that these men are testifying against You?"
Mark	Mark	41	14	61	But He kept silent and did not answer. Again the high priest was questioning Him, and saying to Him, "Are You the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?"
Mark	Mark	41	14	62	And Jesus said, "I am; and you shall see THE SON OF MAN SITTING AT THE RIGHT HAND OF POWER, and COMING WITH THE CLOUDS OF HEAVEN."
Mark	Mark	41	14	63	Tearing his clothes, the high priest *said, "What further need do we have of witnesses?
Mark	Mark	41	14	64	"You have heard the blasphemy; how does it seem to you?" And they all condemned Him to be deserving of death.
Mark	Mark	41	14	65	Some began to spit at Him, and to blindfold Him, and to beat Him with their fists, and to say to Him, "Prophesy!" And the officers received Him with slaps in the face.
Mark	Mark	41	14	66	As Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant-girls of the high priest *came,
Mark	Mark	41	14	67	and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him and *said, "You also were with Jesus the Nazarene."
Mark	Mark	41	14	68	But he denied it, saying, "I neither know nor understand what you are talking about." And he went out onto the porch.
Mark	Mark	41	14	69	The servant-girl saw him, and began once more to say to the bystanders, "This is one of them!"
Mark	Mark	41	14	70	But again he denied it. And after a little while the bystanders were again saying to Peter, "Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean too."
Mark	Mark	41	14	71	But he began to curse and swear, "I do not know this man you are talking about!"
Mark	Mark	41	14	72	Immediately a rooster crowed a second time. And Peter remembered how Jesus had made the remark to him, "Before a rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times." And he began to weep.
Mark	Mark	41	15	1	Early in the morning the chief priests with the elders and scribes and the whole Council, immediately held a consultation; and binding Jesus, they led Him away and delivered Him to Pilate.
Mark	Mark	41	15	2	Pilate questioned Him, "Are You the King of the Jews?" And He *answered him, "It is as you say."
Mark	Mark	41	15	3	The chief priests began to accuse Him harshly.
Mark	Mark	41	15	4	Then Pilate questioned Him again, saying, "Do You not answer? See how many charges they bring against You!"
Mark	Mark	41	15	5	But Jesus made no further answer; so Pilate was amazed.
Mark	Mark	41	15	6	Now at the feast he used to release for them any one prisoner whom they requested.
Mark	Mark	41	15	7	The man named Barabbas had been imprisoned with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the insurrection.
Mark	Mark	41	15	8	The crowd went up and began asking him to do as he had been accustomed to do for them.
Mark	Mark	41	15	9	Pilate answered them, saying, "Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?"
Mark	Mark	41	15	10	For he was aware that the chief priests had handed Him over because of envy.
Mark	Mark	41	15	11	But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to ask him to release Barabbas for them instead.
Mark	Mark	41	15	12	Answering again, Pilate said to them, "Then what shall I do with Him whom you call the King of the Jews?"
Mark	Mark	41	15	13	They shouted back, "Crucify Him!"
Mark	Mark	41	15	14	But Pilate said to them, "Why, what evil has He done?" But they shouted all the more, "Crucify Him!"
Mark	Mark	41	15	15	Wishing to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas for them, and after having Jesus scourged, he handed Him over to be crucified.
Mark	Mark	41	15	16	The soldiers took Him away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium), and they *called together the whole Roman cohort.
Mark	Mark	41	15	17	They *dressed Him up in purple, and after twisting a crown of thorns, they put it on Him;
Mark	Mark	41	15	18	and they began to acclaim Him, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
Mark	Mark	41	15	19	They kept beating His head with a reed, and spitting on Him, and kneeling and bowing before Him.
Mark	Mark	41	15	20	After they had mocked Him, they took the purple robe off Him and put His own garments on Him. And they *led Him out to crucify Him.
Mark	Mark	41	15	21	They *pressed into service a passer-by coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene (the father of Alexander and Rufus), to bear His cross.
Mark	Mark	41	15	22	Then they *brought Him to the place Golgotha, which is translated, Place of a Skull.
Mark	Mark	41	15	23	They tried to give Him wine mixed with myrrh; but He did not take it.
Mark	Mark	41	15	24	And they *crucified Him, and *divided up His garments among themselves, casting lots for them to decide what each man should take.
Mark	Mark	41	15	25	It was the third hour when they crucified Him.
Mark	Mark	41	15	26	The inscription of the charge against Him read, "THE KING OF THE JEWS."
Mark	Mark	41	15	27	They *crucified two robbers with Him, one on His right and one on His left.
Mark	Mark	41	15	28	[And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, "And He was numbered with transgressors."]
Mark	Mark	41	15	29	Those passing by were hurling abuse at Him, wagging their heads, and saying, "Ha! You who are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,
Mark	Mark	41	15	30	save Yourself, and come down from the cross!"
Mark	Mark	41	15	31	In the same way the chief priests also, along with the scribes, were mocking Him among themselves and saying, "He saved others; He cannot save Himself.
Mark	Mark	41	15	32	"Let this Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, so that we may see and believe!" Those who were crucified with Him were also insulting Him.
Mark	Mark	41	15	33	When the sixth hour came, darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour.
Mark	Mark	41	15	34	At the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, "ELOI, ELOI, LAMA SABACHTHANI?" which is translated, "MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME?"
Mark	Mark	41	15	35	When some of the bystanders heard it, they began saying, "Behold, He is calling for Elijah."
Mark	Mark	41	15	36	Someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed, and gave Him a drink, saying, "Let us see whether Elijah will come to take Him down."
Mark	Mark	41	15	37	And Jesus uttered a loud cry, and breathed His last.
Mark	Mark	41	15	38	And the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.
Mark	Mark	41	15	39	When the centurion, who was standing right in front of Him, saw the way He breathed His last, he said, "Truly this man was the Son of God!"
Mark	Mark	41	15	40	There were also some women looking on from a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the Less and Joses, and Salome.
Mark	Mark	41	15	41	When He was in Galilee, they used to follow Him and minister to Him; and there were many other women who came up with Him to Jerusalem.
Mark	Mark	41	15	42	When evening had already come, because it was the preparation day, that is, the day before the Sabbath,
Mark	Mark	41	15	43	Joseph of Arimathea came, a prominent member of the Council, who himself was waiting for the kingdom of God; and he gathered up courage and went in before Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.
Mark	Mark	41	15	44	Pilate wondered if He was dead by this time, and summoning the centurion, he questioned him as to whether He was already dead.
Mark	Mark	41	15	45	And ascertaining this from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.
Mark	Mark	41	15	46	Joseph bought a linen cloth, took Him down, wrapped Him in the linen cloth and laid Him in a tomb which had been hewn out in the rock; and he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.
Mark	Mark	41	15	47	Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses were looking on to see where He was laid.
Mark	Mark	41	16	1	When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices, so that they might come and anoint Him.
Mark	Mark	41	16	2	Very early on the first day of the week, they *came to the tomb when the sun had risen.
Mark	Mark	41	16	3	They were saying to one another, "Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?"
Mark	Mark	41	16	4	Looking up, they *saw that the stone had been rolled away, although it was extremely large.
Mark	Mark	41	16	5	Entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting at the right, wearing a white robe; and they were amazed.
Mark	Mark	41	16	6	And he *said to them, "Do not be amazed; you are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has risen; He is not here; behold, here is the place where they laid Him.
Mark	Mark	41	16	7	"But go, tell His disciples and Peter, 'He is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see Him, just as He told you.'"
Mark	Mark	41	16	8	They went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had gripped them; and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.
Mark	Mark	41	16	9	[Now after He had risen early on the first day of the week, He first appeared to Mary Magdalene, from whom He had cast out seven demons.
Mark	Mark	41	16	10	She went and reported to those who had been with Him, while they were mourning and weeping.
Mark	Mark	41	16	11	When they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her, they refused to believe it.
Mark	Mark	41	16	12	After that, He appeared in a different form to two of them while they were walking along on their way to the country.
Mark	Mark	41	16	13	They went away and reported it to the others, but they did not believe them either.
Mark	Mark	41	16	14	Afterward He appeared to the eleven themselves as they were reclining at the table; and He reproached them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who had seen Him after He had risen.
Mark	Mark	41	16	15	And He said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation.
Mark	Mark	41	16	16	"He who has believed and has been baptized shall be saved; but he who has disbelieved shall be condemned.
Mark	Mark	41	16	17	"These signs will accompany those who have believed: in My name they will cast out demons, they will speak with new tongues;
Mark	Mark	41	16	18	they will pick up serpents, and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover."
Mark	Mark	41	16	19	So then, when the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, He was received up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.
Mark	Mark	41	16	20	And they went out and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them, and confirmed the word by the signs that followed.] [And they promptly reported all these instructions to Peter and his companions. And after that, Jesus Himself sent out through them from east to west the sacred and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation.]
Luke	Luke	42	1	1	Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile an account of the things accomplished among us,
Luke	Luke	42	1	2	just as they were handed down to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word,
Luke	Luke	42	1	3	it seemed fitting for me as well, having investigated everything carefully from the beginning, to write it out for you in consecutive order, most excellent Theophilus;
Luke	Luke	42	1	4	so that you may know the exact truth about the things you have been taught.
Luke	Luke	42	1	5	In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zacharias, of the division of Abijah; and he had a wife from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.
Luke	Luke	42	1	6	They were both righteous in the sight of God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and requirements of the Lord.
Luke	Luke	42	1	7	But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in years.
Luke	Luke	42	1	8	Now it happened that while he was performing his priestly service before God in the appointed order of his division,
Luke	Luke	42	1	9	according to the custom of the priestly office, he was chosen by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense.
Luke	Luke	42	1	10	And the whole multitude of the people were in prayer outside at the hour of the incense offering.
Luke	Luke	42	1	11	And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing to the right of the altar of incense.
Luke	Luke	42	1	12	Zacharias was troubled when he saw the angel, and fear gripped him.
Luke	Luke	42	1	13	But the angel said to him, "Do not be afraid, Zacharias, for your petition has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you will give him the name John.
Luke	Luke	42	1	14	"You will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth.
Luke	Luke	42	1	15	"For he will be great in the sight of the Lord; and he will drink no wine or liquor, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit while yet in his mother's womb.
Luke	Luke	42	1	16	"And he will turn many of the sons of Israel back to the Lord their God.
Luke	Luke	42	1	17	"It is he who will go as a forerunner before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah, TO TURN THE HEARTS OF THE FATHERS BACK TO THE CHILDREN, and the disobedient to the attitude of the righteous, so as to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."
Luke	Luke	42	1	18	Zacharias said to the angel, "How will I know this for certain? For I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years."
Luke	Luke	42	1	19	The angel answered and said to him, "I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.
Luke	Luke	42	1	20	"And behold, you shall be silent and unable to speak until the day when these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time."
Luke	Luke	42	1	21	The people were waiting for Zacharias, and were wondering at his delay in the temple.
Luke	Luke	42	1	22	But when he came out, he was unable to speak to them; and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple; and he kept making signs to them, and remained mute.
Luke	Luke	42	1	23	When the days of his priestly service were ended, he went back home.
Luke	Luke	42	1	24	After these days Elizabeth his wife became pregnant, and she kept herself in seclusion for five months, saying,
Luke	Luke	42	1	25	"This is the way the Lord has dealt with me in the days when He looked with favor upon me, to take away my disgrace among men."
Luke	Luke	42	1	26	Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city in Galilee called Nazareth,
Luke	Luke	42	1	27	to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, of the descendants of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.
Luke	Luke	42	1	28	And coming in, he said to her, "Greetings, favored one! The Lord is with you."
Luke	Luke	42	1	29	But she was very perplexed at this statement, and kept pondering what kind of salutation this was.
Luke	Luke	42	1	30	The angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary; for you have found favor with God.
Luke	Luke	42	1	31	"And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name Him Jesus.
Luke	Luke	42	1	32	"He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David;
Luke	Luke	42	1	33	and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and His kingdom will have no end."
Luke	Luke	42	1	34	Mary said to the angel, "How can this be, since I am a virgin?"
Luke	Luke	42	1	35	The angel answered and said to her, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; and for that reason the holy Child shall be called the Son of God.
Luke	Luke	42	1	36	"And behold, even your relative Elizabeth has also conceived a son in her old age; and she who was called barren is now in her sixth month.
Luke	Luke	42	1	37	"For nothing will be impossible with God."
Luke	Luke	42	1	38	And Mary said, "Behold, the bondslave of the Lord; may it be done to me according to your word." And the angel departed from her.
Luke	Luke	42	1	39	Now at this time Mary arose and went in a hurry to the hill country, to a city of Judah,
Luke	Luke	42	1	40	and entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.
Luke	Luke	42	1	41	When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
Luke	Luke	42	1	42	And she cried out with a loud voice and said, "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!
Luke	Luke	42	1	43	"And how has it happened to me, that the mother of my Lord would come to me?
Luke	Luke	42	1	44	"For behold, when the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy.
Luke	Luke	42	1	45	"And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what had been spoken to her by the Lord."
Luke	Luke	42	1	46	And Mary said: "My soul exalts the Lord,
Luke	Luke	42	1	47	And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.
Luke	Luke	42	1	48	"For He has had regard for the humble state of His bondslave; For behold, from this time on all generations will count me blessed.
Luke	Luke	42	1	49	"For the Mighty One has done great things for me; And holy is His name.
Luke	Luke	42	1	50	"AND HIS MERCY IS UPON GENERATION AFTER GENERATION TOWARD THOSE WHO FEAR HIM.
Luke	Luke	42	1	51	"He has done mighty deeds with His arm; He has scattered those who were proud in the thoughts of their heart.
Luke	Luke	42	1	52	"He has brought down rulers from their thrones, And has exalted those who were humble.
Luke	Luke	42	1	53	"HE HAS FILLED THE HUNGRY WITH GOOD THINGS; And sent away the rich empty-handed.
Luke	Luke	42	1	54	"He has given help to Israel His servant, In remembrance of His mercy,
Luke	Luke	42	1	55	As He spoke to our fathers, To Abraham and his descendants forever."
Luke	Luke	42	1	56	And Mary stayed with her about three months, and then returned to her home.
Luke	Luke	42	1	57	Now the time had come for Elizabeth to give birth, and she gave birth to a son.
Luke	Luke	42	1	58	Her neighbors and her relatives heard that the Lord had displayed His great mercy toward her; and they were rejoicing with her.
Luke	Luke	42	1	59	And it happened that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to call him Zacharias, after his father.
Luke	Luke	42	1	60	But his mother answered and said, "No indeed; but he shall be called John."
Luke	Luke	42	1	61	And they said to her, "There is no one among your relatives who is called by that name."
Luke	Luke	42	1	62	And they made signs to his father, as to what he wanted him called.
Luke	Luke	42	1	63	And he asked for a tablet and wrote as follows, "His name is John." And they were all astonished.
Luke	Luke	42	1	64	And at once his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he began to speak in praise of God.
Luke	Luke	42	1	65	Fear came on all those living around them; and all these matters were being talked about in all the hill country of Judea.
Luke	Luke	42	1	66	All who heard them kept them in mind, saying, "What then will this child turn out to be?" For the hand of the Lord was certainly with him.
Luke	Luke	42	1	67	And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying:
Luke	Luke	42	1	68	"Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, For He has visited us and accomplished redemption for His people,
Luke	Luke	42	1	69	And has raised up a horn of salvation for us In the house of David His servant--
Luke	Luke	42	1	70	As He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from of old--
Luke	Luke	42	1	71	Salvation FROM OUR ENEMIES, And FROM THE HAND OF ALL WHO HATE US;
Luke	Luke	42	1	72	To show mercy toward our fathers, And to remember His holy covenant,
Luke	Luke	42	1	73	The oath which He swore to Abraham our father,
Luke	Luke	42	1	74	To grant us that we, being rescued from the hand of our enemies, Might serve Him without fear,
Luke	Luke	42	1	75	In holiness and righteousness before Him all our days.
Luke	Luke	42	1	76	"And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High; For you will go on BEFORE THE LORD TO PREPARE HIS WAYS;
Luke	Luke	42	1	77	To give to His people the knowledge of salvation By the forgiveness of their sins,
Luke	Luke	42	1	78	Because of the tender mercy of our God, With which the Sunrise from on high will visit us,
Luke	Luke	42	1	79	TO SHINE UPON THOSE WHO SIT IN DARKNESS AND THE SHADOW OF DEATH, To guide our feet into the way of peace."
Luke	Luke	42	1	80	And the child continued to grow and to become strong in spirit, and he lived in the deserts until the day of his public appearance to Israel.
Luke	Luke	42	2	1	Now in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus, that a census be taken of all the inhabited earth.
Luke	Luke	42	2	2	This was the first census taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria.
Luke	Luke	42	2	3	And everyone was on his way to register for the census, each to his own city.
Luke	Luke	42	2	4	Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David,
Luke	Luke	42	2	5	in order to register along with Mary, who was engaged to him, and was with child.
Luke	Luke	42	2	6	While they were there, the days were completed for her to give birth.
Luke	Luke	42	2	7	And she gave birth to her firstborn son; and she wrapped Him in cloths, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.
Luke	Luke	42	2	8	In the same region there were some shepherds staying out in the fields and keeping watch over their flock by night.
Luke	Luke	42	2	9	And an angel of the Lord suddenly stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them; and they were terribly frightened.
Luke	Luke	42	2	10	But the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be for all the people;
Luke	Luke	42	2	11	for today in the city of David there has been born for you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.
Luke	Luke	42	2	12	"This will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger."
Luke	Luke	42	2	13	And suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,
Luke	Luke	42	2	14	"Glory to God in the highest, And on earth peace among men with whom He is pleased."
Luke	Luke	42	2	15	When the angels had gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds began saying to one another, "Let us go straight to Bethlehem then, and see this thing that has happened which the Lord has made known to us."
Luke	Luke	42	2	16	So they came in a hurry and found their way to Mary and Joseph, and the baby as He lay in the manger.
Luke	Luke	42	2	17	When they had seen this, they made known the statement which had been told them about this Child.
Luke	Luke	42	2	18	And all who heard it wondered at the things which were told them by the shepherds.
Luke	Luke	42	2	19	But Mary treasured all these things, pondering them in her heart.
Luke	Luke	42	2	20	The shepherds went back, glorifying and praising God for all that they had heard and seen, just as had been told them.
Luke	Luke	42	2	21	And when eight days had passed, before His circumcision, His name was then called Jesus, the name given by the angel before He was conceived in the womb.
Luke	Luke	42	2	22	And when the days for their purification according to the law of Moses were completed, they brought Him up to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord
Luke	Luke	42	2	23	(as it is written in the Law of the Lord, "EVERY firstborn MALE THAT OPENS THE WOMB SHALL BE CALLED HOLY TO THE LORD"),
Luke	Luke	42	2	24	and to offer a sacrifice according to what was said in the Law of the Lord, "A PAIR OF TURTLEDOVES OR TWO YOUNG PIGEONS."
Luke	Luke	42	2	25	And there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; and this man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel; and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
Luke	Luke	42	2	26	And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ.
Luke	Luke	42	2	27	And he came in the Spirit into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to carry out for Him the custom of the Law,
Luke	Luke	42	2	28	then he took Him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,
Luke	Luke	42	2	29	"Now Lord, You are releasing Your bond-servant to depart in peace, According to Your word;
Luke	Luke	42	2	30	For my eyes have seen Your salvation,
Luke	Luke	42	2	31	Which You have prepared in the presence of all peoples,
Luke	Luke	42	2	32	A LIGHT OF REVELATION TO THE GENTILES, And the glory of Your people Israel."
Luke	Luke	42	2	33	And His father and mother were amazed at the things which were being said about Him.
Luke	Luke	42	2	34	And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary His mother, "Behold, this Child is appointed for the fall and rise of many in Israel, and for a sign to be opposed--
Luke	Luke	42	2	35	and a sword will pierce even your own soul--to the end that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed."
Luke	Luke	42	2	36	And there was a prophetess, Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in years and had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage,
Luke	Luke	42	2	37	and then as a widow to the age of eighty-four. She never left the temple, serving night and day with fastings and prayers.
Luke	Luke	42	2	38	At that very moment she came up and began giving thanks to God, and continued to speak of Him to all those who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.
Luke	Luke	42	2	39	When they had performed everything according to the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city of Nazareth.
Luke	Luke	42	2	40	The Child continued to grow and become strong, increasing in wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him.
Luke	Luke	42	2	41	Now His parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover.
Luke	Luke	42	2	42	And when He became twelve, they went up there according to the custom of the Feast;
Luke	Luke	42	2	43	and as they were returning, after spending the full number of days, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. But His parents were unaware of it,
Luke	Luke	42	2	44	but supposed Him to be in the caravan, and went a day's journey; and they began looking for Him among their relatives and acquaintances.
Luke	Luke	42	2	45	When they did not find Him, they returned to Jerusalem looking for Him.
Luke	Luke	42	2	46	Then, after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them and asking them questions.
Luke	Luke	42	2	47	And all who heard Him were amazed at His understanding and His answers.
Luke	Luke	42	2	48	When they saw Him, they were astonished; and His mother said to Him, "Son, why have You treated us this way? Behold, Your father and I have been anxiously looking for You."
Luke	Luke	42	2	49	And He said to them, "Why is it that you were looking for Me? Did you not know that I had to be in My Father's house?"
Luke	Luke	42	2	50	But they did not understand the statement which He had made to them.
Luke	Luke	42	2	51	And He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and He continued in subjection to them; and His mother treasured all these things in her heart.
Luke	Luke	42	2	52	And Jesus kept increasing in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.
Luke	Luke	42	3	1	Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene,
Luke	Luke	42	3	2	in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness.
Luke	Luke	42	3	3	And he came into all the district around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins;
Luke	Luke	42	3	4	as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, "THE VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS, 'MAKE READY THE WAY OF THE LORD, MAKE HIS PATHS STRAIGHT.
Luke	Luke	42	3	5	'EVERY RAVINE WILL BE FILLED, AND EVERY MOUNTAIN AND HILL WILL BE BROUGHT LOW; THE CROOKED WILL BECOME STRAIGHT, AND THE ROUGH ROADS SMOOTH;
Luke	Luke	42	3	6	AND ALL FLESH WILL SEE THE SALVATION OF GOD.'"
Luke	Luke	42	3	7	So he began saying to the crowds who were going out to be baptized by him, "You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Luke	Luke	42	3	8	"Therefore bear fruits in keeping with repentance, and do not begin to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our father,' for I say to you that from these stones God is able to raise up children to Abraham.
Luke	Luke	42	3	9	"Indeed the axe is already laid at the root of the trees; so every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire."
Luke	Luke	42	3	10	And the crowds were questioning him, saying, "Then what shall we do?"
Luke	Luke	42	3	11	And he would answer and say to them, "The man who has two tunics is to share with him who has none; and he who has food is to do likewise."
Luke	Luke	42	3	12	And some tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him, "Teacher, what shall we do?"
Luke	Luke	42	3	13	And he said to them, "Collect no more than what you have been ordered to."
Luke	Luke	42	3	14	Some soldiers were questioning him, saying, "And what about us, what shall we do?" And he said to them, "Do not take money from anyone by force, or accuse anyone falsely, and be content with your wages."
Luke	Luke	42	3	15	Now while the people were in a state of expectation and all were wondering in their hearts about John, as to whether he was the Christ,
Luke	Luke	42	3	16	John answered and said to them all, "As for me, I baptize you with water; but One is coming who is mightier than I, and I am not fit to untie the thong of His sandals; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
Luke	Luke	42	3	17	"His winnowing fork is in His hand to thoroughly clear His threshing floor, and to gather the wheat into His barn; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire."
Luke	Luke	42	3	18	So with many other exhortations he preached the gospel to the people.
Luke	Luke	42	3	19	But when Herod the tetrarch was reprimanded by him because of Herodias, his brother's wife, and because of all the wicked things which Herod had done,
Luke	Luke	42	3	20	Herod also added this to them all: he locked John up in prison.
Luke	Luke	42	3	21	Now when all the people were baptized, Jesus was also baptized, and while He was praying, heaven was opened,
Luke	Luke	42	3	22	and the Holy Spirit descended upon Him in bodily form like a dove, and a voice came out of heaven, "You are My beloved Son, in You I am well-pleased."
Luke	Luke	42	3	23	When He began His ministry, Jesus Himself was about thirty years of age, being, as was supposed, the son of Joseph, the son of Eli,
Luke	Luke	42	3	24	the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph,
Luke	Luke	42	3	25	the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Hesli, the son of Naggai,
Luke	Luke	42	3	26	the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the son of Joda,
Luke	Luke	42	3	27	the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri,
Luke	Luke	42	3	28	the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er,
Luke	Luke	42	3	29	the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,
Luke	Luke	42	3	30	the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim,
Luke	Luke	42	3	31	the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David,
Luke	Luke	42	3	32	the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon,
Luke	Luke	42	3	33	the son of Amminadab, the son of Admin, the son of Ram, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah,
Luke	Luke	42	3	34	the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor,
Luke	Luke	42	3	35	the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Heber, the son of Shelah,
Luke	Luke	42	3	36	the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,
Luke	Luke	42	3	37	the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan,
Luke	Luke	42	3	38	the son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.
Luke	Luke	42	4	1	Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led around by the Spirit in the wilderness
Luke	Luke	42	4	2	for forty days, being tempted by the devil. And He ate nothing during those days, and when they had ended, He became hungry.
Luke	Luke	42	4	3	And the devil said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread."
Luke	Luke	42	4	4	And Jesus answered him, "It is written, 'MAN SHALL NOT LIVE ON BREAD ALONE.'"
Luke	Luke	42	4	5	And he led Him up and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
Luke	Luke	42	4	6	And the devil said to Him, "I will give You all this domain and its glory; for it has been handed over to me, and I give it to whomever I wish.
Luke	Luke	42	4	7	"Therefore if You worship before me, it shall all be Yours."
Luke	Luke	42	4	8	Jesus answered him, "It is written, 'YOU SHALL WORSHIP THE LORD YOUR GOD AND SERVE HIM ONLY.'"
Luke	Luke	42	4	9	And he led Him to Jerusalem and had Him stand on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down from here;
Luke	Luke	42	4	10	for it is written, 'HE WILL COMMAND HIS ANGELS CONCERNING YOU TO GUARD YOU,'
Luke	Luke	42	4	11	and, 'ON their HANDS THEY WILL BEAR YOU UP, SO THAT YOU WILL NOT STRIKE YOUR FOOT AGAINST A STONE.'"
Luke	Luke	42	4	12	And Jesus answered and said to him, "It is said, 'YOU SHALL NOT PUT THE LORD YOUR GOD TO THE TEST.'"
Luke	Luke	42	4	13	When the devil had finished every temptation, he left Him until an opportune time.
Luke	Luke	42	4	14	And Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about Him spread through all the surrounding district.
Luke	Luke	42	4	15	And He began teaching in their synagogues and was praised by all.
Luke	Luke	42	4	16	And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up; and as was His custom, He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath, and stood up to read.
Luke	Luke	42	4	17	And the book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to Him. And He opened the book and found the place where it was written,
Luke	Luke	42	4	18	"THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS UPON ME, BECAUSE HE ANOINTED ME TO PREACH THE GOSPEL TO THE POOR. HE HAS SENT ME TO PROCLAIM RELEASE TO THE CAPTIVES, AND RECOVERY OF SIGHT TO THE BLIND, TO SET FREE THOSE WHO ARE OPPRESSED,
Luke	Luke	42	4	19	TO PROCLAIM THE FAVORABLE YEAR OF THE LORD."
Luke	Luke	42	4	20	And He closed the book, gave it back to the attendant and sat down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on Him.
Luke	Luke	42	4	21	And He began to say to them, "Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing."
Luke	Luke	42	4	22	And all were speaking well of Him, and wondering at the gracious words which were falling from His lips; and they were saying, "Is this not Joseph's son?"
Luke	Luke	42	4	23	And He said to them, "No doubt you will quote this proverb to Me, 'Physician, heal yourself! Whatever we heard was done at Capernaum, do here in your hometown as well.'"
Luke	Luke	42	4	24	And He said, "Truly I say to you, no prophet is welcome in his hometown.
Luke	Luke	42	4	25	"But I say to you in truth, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up for three years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land;
Luke	Luke	42	4	26	and yet Elijah was sent to none of them, but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow.
Luke	Luke	42	4	27	"And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian."
Luke	Luke	42	4	28	And all the people in the synagogue were filled with rage as they heard these things;
Luke	Luke	42	4	29	and they got up and drove Him out of the city, and led Him to the brow of the hill on which their city had been built, in order to throw Him down the cliff.
Luke	Luke	42	4	30	But passing through their midst, He went His way.
Luke	Luke	42	4	31	And He came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and He was teaching them on the Sabbath;
Luke	Luke	42	4	32	and they were amazed at His teaching, for His message was with authority.
Luke	Luke	42	4	33	In the synagogue there was a man possessed by the spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,
Luke	Luke	42	4	34	"Let us alone! What business do we have with each other, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are--the Holy One of God!"
Luke	Luke	42	4	35	But Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be quiet and come out of him!" And when the demon had thrown him down in the midst of the people, he came out of him without doing him any harm.
Luke	Luke	42	4	36	And amazement came upon them all, and they began talking with one another saying, "What is this message? For with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits and they come out."
Luke	Luke	42	4	37	And the report about Him was spreading into every locality in the surrounding district.
Luke	Luke	42	4	38	Then He got up and left the synagogue, and entered Simon's home. Now Simon's mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Him to help her.
Luke	Luke	42	4	39	And standing over her, He rebuked the fever, and it left her; and she immediately got up and waited on them.
Luke	Luke	42	4	40	While the sun was setting, all those who had any who were sick with various diseases brought them to Him; and laying His hands on each one of them, He was healing them.
Luke	Luke	42	4	41	Demons also were coming out of many, shouting, "You are the Son of God!" But rebuking them, He would not allow them to speak, because they knew Him to be the Christ.
Luke	Luke	42	4	42	When day came, Jesus left and went to a secluded place; and the crowds were searching for Him, and came to Him and tried to keep Him from going away from them.
Luke	Luke	42	4	43	But He said to them, "I must preach the kingdom of God to the other cities also, for I was sent for this purpose."
Luke	Luke	42	4	44	So He kept on preaching in the synagogues of Judea.
Luke	Luke	42	5	1	Now it happened that while the crowd was pressing around Him and listening to the word of God, He was standing by the lake of Gennesaret;
Luke	Luke	42	5	2	and He saw two boats lying at the edge of the lake; but the fishermen had gotten out of them and were washing their nets.
Luke	Luke	42	5	3	And He got into one of the boats, which was Simon's, and asked him to put out a little way from the land. And He sat down and began teaching the people from the boat.
Luke	Luke	42	5	4	When He had finished speaking, He said to Simon, "Put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch."
Luke	Luke	42	5	5	Simon answered and said, "Master, we worked hard all night and caught nothing, but I will do as You say and let down the nets."
Luke	Luke	42	5	6	When they had done this, they enclosed a great quantity of fish, and their nets began to break;
Luke	Luke	42	5	7	so they signaled to their partners in the other boat for them to come and help them. And they came and filled both of the boats, so that they began to sink.
Luke	Luke	42	5	8	But when Simon Peter saw that, he fell down at Jesus' feet, saying, "Go away from me Lord, for I am a sinful man!"
Luke	Luke	42	5	9	For amazement had seized him and all his companions because of the catch of fish which they had taken;
Luke	Luke	42	5	10	and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, "Do not fear, from now on you will be catching men."
Luke	Luke	42	5	11	When they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed Him.
Luke	Luke	42	5	12	While He was in one of the cities, behold, there was a man covered with leprosy; and when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and implored Him, saying, "Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean."
Luke	Luke	42	5	13	And He stretched out His hand and touched him, saying, "I am willing; be cleansed." And immediately the leprosy left him.
Luke	Luke	42	5	14	And He ordered him to tell no one, "But go and show yourself to the priest and make an offering for your cleansing, just as Moses commanded, as a testimony to them."
Luke	Luke	42	5	15	But the news about Him was spreading even farther, and large crowds were gathering to hear Him and to be healed of their sicknesses.
Luke	Luke	42	5	16	But Jesus Himself would often slip away to the wilderness and pray.
Luke	Luke	42	5	17	One day He was teaching; and there were some Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting there, who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was present for Him to perform healing.
Luke	Luke	42	5	18	And some men were carrying on a bed a man who was paralyzed; and they were trying to bring him in and to set him down in front of Him.
Luke	Luke	42	5	19	But not finding any way to bring him in because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down through the tiles with his stretcher, into the middle of the crowd, in front of Jesus.
Luke	Luke	42	5	20	Seeing their faith, He said, "Friend, your sins are forgiven you."
Luke	Luke	42	5	21	The scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, "Who is this man who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?"
Luke	Luke	42	5	22	But Jesus, aware of their reasonings, answered and said to them, "Why are you reasoning in your hearts?
Luke	Luke	42	5	23	"Which is easier, to say, 'Your sins have been forgiven you,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?
Luke	Luke	42	5	24	"But, so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,"--He said to the paralytic--"I say to you, get up, and pick up your stretcher and go home."
Luke	Luke	42	5	25	Immediately he got up before them, and picked up what he had been lying on, and went home glorifying God.
Luke	Luke	42	5	26	They were all struck with astonishment and began glorifying God; and they were filled with fear, saying, "We have seen remarkable things today."
Luke	Luke	42	5	27	After that He went out and noticed a tax collector named Levi sitting in the tax booth, and He said to him, "Follow Me."
Luke	Luke	42	5	28	And he left everything behind, and got up and began to follow Him.
Luke	Luke	42	5	29	And Levi gave a big reception for Him in his house; and there was a great crowd of tax collectors and other people who were reclining at the table with them.
Luke	Luke	42	5	30	The Pharisees and their scribes began grumbling at His disciples, saying, "Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?"
Luke	Luke	42	5	31	And Jesus answered and said to them, "It is not those who are well who need a physician, but those who are sick.
Luke	Luke	42	5	32	"I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance."
Luke	Luke	42	5	33	And they said to Him, "The disciples of John often fast and offer prayers, the disciples of the Pharisees also do the same, but Yours eat and drink."
Luke	Luke	42	5	34	And Jesus said to them, "You cannot make the attendants of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them, can you?
Luke	Luke	42	5	35	"But the days will come; and when the bridegroom is taken away from them, then they will fast in those days."
Luke	Luke	42	5	36	And He was also telling them a parable: "No one tears a piece of cloth from a new garment and puts it on an old garment; otherwise he will both tear the new, and the piece from the new will not match the old.
Luke	Luke	42	5	37	"And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled out, and the skins will be ruined.
Luke	Luke	42	5	38	"But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.
Luke	Luke	42	5	39	"And no one, after drinking old wine wishes for new; for he says, 'The old is good enough.'"
Luke	Luke	42	6	1	Now it happened that He was passing through some grainfields on a Sabbath; and His disciples were picking the heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands, and eating the grain.
Luke	Luke	42	6	2	But some of the Pharisees said, "Why do you do what is not lawful on the Sabbath?"
Luke	Luke	42	6	3	And Jesus answering them said, "Have you not even read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him,
Luke	Luke	42	6	4	how he entered the house of God, and took and ate the consecrated bread which is not lawful for any to eat except the priests alone, and gave it to his companions?"
Luke	Luke	42	6	5	And He was saying to them, "The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
Luke	Luke	42	6	6	On another Sabbath He entered the synagogue and was teaching; and there was a man there whose right hand was withered.
Luke	Luke	42	6	7	The scribes and the Pharisees were watching Him closely to see if He healed on the Sabbath, so that they might find reason to accuse Him.
Luke	Luke	42	6	8	But He knew what they were thinking, and He said to the man with the withered hand, "Get up and come forward!" And he got up and came forward.
Luke	Luke	42	6	9	And Jesus said to them, "I ask you, is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the Sabbath, to save a life or to destroy it?"
Luke	Luke	42	6	10	After looking around at them all, He said to him, "Stretch out your hand!" And he did so; and his hand was restored.
Luke	Luke	42	6	11	But they themselves were filled with rage, and discussed together what they might do to Jesus.
Luke	Luke	42	6	12	It was at this time that He went off to the mountain to pray, and He spent the whole night in prayer to God.
Luke	Luke	42	6	13	And when day came, He called His disciples to Him and chose twelve of them, whom He also named as apostles:
Luke	Luke	42	6	14	Simon, whom He also named Peter, and Andrew his brother; and James and John; and Philip and Bartholomew;
Luke	Luke	42	6	15	and Matthew and Thomas; James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the Zealot;
Luke	Luke	42	6	16	Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.
Luke	Luke	42	6	17	Jesus came down with them and stood on a level place; and there was a large crowd of His disciples, and a great throng of people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the coastal region of Tyre and Sidon,
Luke	Luke	42	6	18	who had come to hear Him and to be healed of their diseases; and those who were troubled with unclean spirits were being cured.
Luke	Luke	42	6	19	And all the people were trying to touch Him, for power was coming from Him and healing them all.
Luke	Luke	42	6	20	And turning His gaze toward His disciples, He began to say, "Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.
Luke	Luke	42	6	21	"Blessed are you who hunger now, for you shall be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now, for you shall laugh.
Luke	Luke	42	6	22	"Blessed are you when men hate you, and ostracize you, and insult you, and scorn your name as evil, for the sake of the Son of Man.
Luke	Luke	42	6	23	"Be glad in that day and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven. For in the same way their fathers used to treat the prophets.
Luke	Luke	42	6	24	"But woe to you who are rich, for you are receiving your comfort in full.
Luke	Luke	42	6	25	"Woe to you who are well-fed now, for you shall be hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you shall mourn and weep.
Luke	Luke	42	6	26	"Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for their fathers used to treat the false prophets in the same way.
Luke	Luke	42	6	27	"But I say to you who hear, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,
Luke	Luke	42	6	28	bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.
Luke	Luke	42	6	29	"Whoever hits you on the cheek, offer him the other also; and whoever takes away your coat, do not withhold your shirt from him either.
Luke	Luke	42	6	30	"Give to everyone who asks of you, and whoever takes away what is yours, do not demand it back.
Luke	Luke	42	6	31	"Treat others the same way you want them to treat you.
Luke	Luke	42	6	32	"If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.
Luke	Luke	42	6	33	"If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same.
Luke	Luke	42	6	34	"If you lend to those from whom you expect to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners in order to receive back the same amount.
Luke	Luke	42	6	35	"But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return; and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High; for He Himself is kind to ungrateful and evil men.
Luke	Luke	42	6	36	"Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.
Luke	Luke	42	6	37	"Do not judge, and you will not be judged; and do not condemn, and you will not be condemned; pardon, and you will be pardoned.
Luke	Luke	42	6	38	"Give, and it will be given to you. They will pour into your lap a good measure--pressed down, shaken together, and running over. For by your standard of measure it will be measured to you in return."
Luke	Luke	42	6	39	And He also spoke a parable to them: "A blind man cannot guide a blind man, can he? Will they not both fall into a pit?
Luke	Luke	42	6	40	"A pupil is not above his teacher; but everyone, after he has been fully trained, will be like his teacher.
Luke	Luke	42	6	41	"Why do you look at the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?
Luke	Luke	42	6	42	"Or how can you say to your brother, 'Brother, let me take out the speck that is in your eye,' when you yourself do not see the log that is in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother's eye.
Luke	Luke	42	6	43	"For there is no good tree which produces bad fruit, nor, on the other hand, a bad tree which produces good fruit.
Luke	Luke	42	6	44	"For each tree is known by its own fruit. For men do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they pick grapes from a briar bush.
Luke	Luke	42	6	45	"The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth what is good; and the evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth what is evil; for his mouth speaks from that which fills his heart.
Luke	Luke	42	6	46	"Why do you call Me, 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do what I say?
Luke	Luke	42	6	47	"Everyone who comes to Me and hears My words and acts on them, I will show you whom he is like:
Luke	Luke	42	6	48	he is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid a foundation on the rock; and when a flood occurred, the torrent burst against that house and could not shake it, because it had been well built.
Luke	Luke	42	6	49	"But the one who has heard and has not acted accordingly, is like a man who built a house on the ground without any foundation; and the torrent burst against it and immediately it collapsed, and the ruin of that house was great."
Luke	Luke	42	7	1	When He had completed all His discourse in the hearing of the people, He went to Capernaum.
Luke	Luke	42	7	2	And a centurion's slave, who was highly regarded by him, was sick and about to die.
Luke	Luke	42	7	3	When he heard about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders asking Him to come and save the life of his slave.
Luke	Luke	42	7	4	When they came to Jesus, they earnestly implored Him, saying, "He is worthy for You to grant this to him;
Luke	Luke	42	7	5	for he loves our nation and it was he who built us our synagogue."
Luke	Luke	42	7	6	Now Jesus started on His way with them; and when He was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends, saying to Him, "Lord, do not trouble Yourself further, for I am not worthy for You to come under my roof;
Luke	Luke	42	7	7	for this reason I did not even consider myself worthy to come to You, but just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
Luke	Luke	42	7	8	"For I also am a man placed under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to this one, 'Go!' and he goes, and to another, 'Come!' and he comes, and to my slave, 'Do this!' and he does it."
Luke	Luke	42	7	9	Now when Jesus heard this, He marveled at him, and turned and said to the crowd that was following Him, "I say to you, not even in Israel have I found such great faith."
Luke	Luke	42	7	10	When those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the slave in good health.
Luke	Luke	42	7	11	Soon afterwards He went to a city called Nain; and His disciples were going along with Him, accompanied by a large crowd.
Luke	Luke	42	7	12	Now as He approached the gate of the city, a dead man was being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow; and a sizeable crowd from the city was with her.
Luke	Luke	42	7	13	When the Lord saw her, He felt compassion for her, and said to her, "Do not weep."
Luke	Luke	42	7	14	And He came up and touched the coffin; and the bearers came to a halt. And He said, "Young man, I say to you, arise!"
Luke	Luke	42	7	15	The dead man sat up and began to speak. And Jesus gave him back to his mother.
Luke	Luke	42	7	16	Fear gripped them all, and they began glorifying God, saying, "A great prophet has arisen among us!" and, "God has visited His people!"
Luke	Luke	42	7	17	This report concerning Him went out all over Judea and in all the surrounding district.
Luke	Luke	42	7	18	The disciples of John reported to him about all these things.
Luke	Luke	42	7	19	Summoning two of his disciples, John sent them to the Lord, saying, "Are You the Expected One, or do we look for someone else?"
Luke	Luke	42	7	20	When the men came to Him, they said, "John the Baptist has sent us to You, to ask, 'Are You the Expected One, or do we look for someone else?'"
Luke	Luke	42	7	21	At that very time He cured many people of diseases and afflictions and evil spirits; and He gave sight to many who were blind.
Luke	Luke	42	7	22	And He answered and said to them, "Go and report to John what you have seen and heard: the BLIND RECEIVE SIGHT, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the POOR HAVE THE GOSPEL PREACHED TO THEM.
Luke	Luke	42	7	23	"Blessed is he who does not take offense at Me."
Luke	Luke	42	7	24	When the messengers of John had left, He began to speak to the crowds about John, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?
Luke	Luke	42	7	25	"But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Those who are splendidly clothed and live in luxury are found in royal palaces!
Luke	Luke	42	7	26	"But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and one who is more than a prophet.
Luke	Luke	42	7	27	"This is the one about whom it is written, 'BEHOLD, I SEND MY MESSENGER AHEAD OF YOU, WHO WILL PREPARE YOUR WAY BEFORE YOU.'
Luke	Luke	42	7	28	"I say to you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he."
Luke	Luke	42	7	29	When all the people and the tax collectors heard this, they acknowledged God's justice, having been baptized with the baptism of John.
Luke	Luke	42	7	30	But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected God's purpose for themselves, not having been baptized by John.
Luke	Luke	42	7	31	"To what then shall I compare the men of this generation, and what are they like?
Luke	Luke	42	7	32	"They are like children who sit in the market place and call to one another, and they say, 'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not weep.'
Luke	Luke	42	7	33	"For John the Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine, and you say, 'He has a demon!'
Luke	Luke	42	7	34	"The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, 'Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!'
Luke	Luke	42	7	35	"Yet wisdom is vindicated by all her children."
Luke	Luke	42	7	36	Now one of the Pharisees was requesting Him to dine with him, and He entered the Pharisee's house and reclined at the table.
Luke	Luke	42	7	37	And there was a woman in the city who was a sinner; and when she learned that He was reclining at the table in the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster vial of perfume,
Luke	Luke	42	7	38	and standing behind Him at His feet, weeping, she began to wet His feet with her tears, and kept wiping them with the hair of her head, and kissing His feet and anointing them with the perfume.
Luke	Luke	42	7	39	Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he said to himself, "If this man were a prophet He would know who and what sort of person this woman is who is touching Him, that she is a sinner."
Luke	Luke	42	7	40	And Jesus answered him, "Simon, I have something to say to you." And he replied, "Say it, Teacher."
Luke	Luke	42	7	41	"A moneylender had two debtors: one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.
Luke	Luke	42	7	42	"When they were unable to repay, he graciously forgave them both. So which of them will love him more?"
Luke	Luke	42	7	43	Simon answered and said, "I suppose the one whom he forgave more." And He said to him, "You have judged correctly."
Luke	Luke	42	7	44	Turning toward the woman, He said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave Me no water for My feet, but she has wet My feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.
Luke	Luke	42	7	45	"You gave Me no kiss; but she, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss My feet.
Luke	Luke	42	7	46	"You did not anoint My head with oil, but she anointed My feet with perfume.
Luke	Luke	42	7	47	"For this reason I say to you, her sins, which are many, have been forgiven, for she loved much; but he who is forgiven little, loves little."
Luke	Luke	42	7	48	Then He said to her, "Your sins have been forgiven."
Luke	Luke	42	7	49	Those who were reclining at the table with Him began to say to themselves, "Who is this man who even forgives sins?"
Luke	Luke	42	7	50	And He said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you; go in peace."
Luke	Luke	42	8	1	Soon afterwards, He began going around from one city and village to another, proclaiming and preaching the kingdom of God. The twelve were with Him,
Luke	Luke	42	8	2	and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and sicknesses: Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out,
Luke	Luke	42	8	3	and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others who were contributing to their support out of their private means.
Luke	Luke	42	8	4	When a large crowd was coming together, and those from the various cities were journeying to Him, He spoke by way of a parable:
Luke	Luke	42	8	5	"The sower went out to sow his seed; and as he sowed, some fell beside the road, and it was trampled under foot and the birds of the air ate it up.
Luke	Luke	42	8	6	"Other seed fell on rocky soil, and as soon as it grew up, it withered away, because it had no moisture.
Luke	Luke	42	8	7	"Other seed fell among the thorns; and the thorns grew up with it and choked it out.
Luke	Luke	42	8	8	"Other seed fell into the good soil, and grew up, and produced a crop a hundred times as great." As He said these things, He would call out, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
Luke	Luke	42	8	9	His disciples began questioning Him as to what this parable meant.
Luke	Luke	42	8	10	And He said, "To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest it is in parables, so that SEEING THEY MAY NOT SEE, AND HEARING THEY MAY NOT UNDERSTAND.
Luke	Luke	42	8	11	"Now the parable is this: the seed is the word of God.
Luke	Luke	42	8	12	"Those beside the road are those who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, so that they will not believe and be saved.
Luke	Luke	42	8	13	"Those on the rocky soil are those who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no firm root; they believe for a while, and in time of temptation fall away.
Luke	Luke	42	8	14	"The seed which fell among the thorns, these are the ones who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with worries and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to maturity.
Luke	Luke	42	8	15	"But the seed in the good soil, these are the ones who have heard the word in an honest and good heart, and hold it fast, and bear fruit with perseverance.
Luke	Luke	42	8	16	"Now no one after lighting a lamp covers it over with a container, or puts it under a bed; but he puts it on a lampstand, so that those who come in may see the light.
Luke	Luke	42	8	17	"For nothing is hidden that will not become evident, nor anything secret that will not be known and come to light.
Luke	Luke	42	8	18	"So take care how you listen; for whoever has, to him more shall be given; and whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has shall be taken away from him."
Luke	Luke	42	8	19	And His mother and brothers came to Him, and they were unable to get to Him because of the crowd.
Luke	Luke	42	8	20	And it was reported to Him, "Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, wishing to see You."
Luke	Luke	42	8	21	But He answered and said to them, "My mother and My brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it."
Luke	Luke	42	8	22	Now on one of those days Jesus and His disciples got into a boat, and He said to them, "Let us go over to the other side of the lake." So they launched out.
Luke	Luke	42	8	23	But as they were sailing along He fell asleep; and a fierce gale of wind descended on the lake, and they began to be swamped and to be in danger.
Luke	Luke	42	8	24	They came to Jesus and woke Him up, saying, "Master, Master, we are perishing!" And He got up and rebuked the wind and the surging waves, and they stopped, and it became calm.
Luke	Luke	42	8	25	And He said to them, "Where is your faith?" They were fearful and amazed, saying to one another, "Who then is this, that He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey Him?"
Luke	Luke	42	8	26	Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee.
Luke	Luke	42	8	27	And when He came out onto the land, He was met by a man from the city who was possessed with demons; and who had not put on any clothing for a long time, and was not living in a house, but in the tombs.
Luke	Luke	42	8	28	Seeing Jesus, he cried out and fell before Him, and said in a loud voice, "What business do we have with each other, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You, do not torment me."
Luke	Luke	42	8	29	For He had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For it had seized him many times; and he was bound with chains and shackles and kept under guard, and yet he would break his bonds and be driven by the demon into the desert.
Luke	Luke	42	8	30	And Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" And he said, "Legion"; for many demons had entered him.
Luke	Luke	42	8	31	They were imploring Him not to command them to go away into the abyss.
Luke	Luke	42	8	32	Now there was a herd of many swine feeding there on the mountain; and the demons implored Him to permit them to enter the swine. And He gave them permission.
Luke	Luke	42	8	33	And the demons came out of the man and entered the swine; and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.
Luke	Luke	42	8	34	When the herdsmen saw what had happened, they ran away and reported it in the city and out in the country.
Luke	Luke	42	8	35	The people went out to see what had happened; and they came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting down at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind; and they became frightened.
Luke	Luke	42	8	36	Those who had seen it reported to them how the man who was demon-possessed had been made well.
Luke	Luke	42	8	37	And all the people of the country of the Gerasenes and the surrounding district asked Him to leave them, for they were gripped with great fear; and He got into a boat and returned.
Luke	Luke	42	8	38	But the man from whom the demons had gone out was begging Him that he might accompany Him; but He sent him away, saying,
Luke	Luke	42	8	39	"Return to your house and describe what great things God has done for you." So he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.
Luke	Luke	42	8	40	And as Jesus returned, the people welcomed Him, for they had all been waiting for Him.
Luke	Luke	42	8	41	And there came a man named Jairus, and he was an official of the synagogue; and he fell at Jesus' feet, and began to implore Him to come to his house;
Luke	Luke	42	8	42	for he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. But as He went, the crowds were pressing against Him.
Luke	Luke	42	8	43	And a woman who had a hemorrhage for twelve years, and could not be healed by anyone,
Luke	Luke	42	8	44	came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His cloak, and immediately her hemorrhage stopped.
Luke	Luke	42	8	45	And Jesus said, "Who is the one who touched Me?" And while they were all denying it, Peter said, "Master, the people are crowding and pressing in on You."
Luke	Luke	42	8	46	But Jesus said, "Someone did touch Me, for I was aware that power had gone out of Me."
Luke	Luke	42	8	47	When the woman saw that she had not escaped notice, she came trembling and fell down before Him, and declared in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched Him, and how she had been immediately healed.
Luke	Luke	42	8	48	And He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace."
Luke	Luke	42	8	49	While He was still speaking, someone *came from the house of the synagogue official, saying, "Your daughter has died; do not trouble the Teacher anymore."
Luke	Luke	42	8	50	But when Jesus heard this, He answered him, "Do not be afraid any longer; only believe, and she will be made well."
Luke	Luke	42	8	51	When He came to the house, He did not allow anyone to enter with Him, except Peter and John and James, and the girl's father and mother.
Luke	Luke	42	8	52	Now they were all weeping and lamenting for her; but He said, "Stop weeping, for she has not died, but is asleep."
Luke	Luke	42	8	53	And they began laughing at Him, knowing that she had died.
Luke	Luke	42	8	54	He, however, took her by the hand and called, saying, "Child, arise!"
Luke	Luke	42	8	55	And her spirit returned, and she got up immediately; and He gave orders for something to be given her to eat.
Luke	Luke	42	8	56	Her parents were amazed; but He instructed them to tell no one what had happened.
Luke	Luke	42	9	1	And He called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all the demons and to heal diseases.
Luke	Luke	42	9	2	And He sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to perform healing.
Luke	Luke	42	9	3	And He said to them, "Take nothing for your journey, neither a staff, nor a bag, nor bread, nor money; and do not even have two tunics apiece.
Luke	Luke	42	9	4	"Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that city.
Luke	Luke	42	9	5	"And as for those who do not receive you, as you go out from that city, shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them."
Luke	Luke	42	9	6	Departing, they began going throughout the villages, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.
Luke	Luke	42	9	7	Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was happening; and he was greatly perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead,
Luke	Luke	42	9	8	and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the prophets of old had risen again.
Luke	Luke	42	9	9	Herod said, "I myself had John beheaded; but who is this man about whom I hear such things?" And he kept trying to see Him.
Luke	Luke	42	9	10	When the apostles returned, they gave an account to Him of all that they had done. Taking them with Him, He withdrew by Himself to a city called Bethsaida.
Luke	Luke	42	9	11	But the crowds were aware of this and followed Him; and welcoming them, He began speaking to them about the kingdom of God and curing those who had need of healing.
Luke	Luke	42	9	12	Now the day was ending, and the twelve came and said to Him, "Send the crowd away, that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside and find lodging and get something to eat; for here we are in a desolate place."
Luke	Luke	42	9	13	But He said to them, "You give them something to eat!" And they said, "We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless perhaps we go and buy food for all these people."
Luke	Luke	42	9	14	(For there were about five thousand men.) And He said to His disciples, "Have them sit down to eat in groups of about fifty each."
Luke	Luke	42	9	15	They did so, and had them all sit down.
Luke	Luke	42	9	16	Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed them, and broke them, and kept giving them to the disciples to set before the people.
Luke	Luke	42	9	17	And they all ate and were satisfied; and the broken pieces which they had left over were picked up, twelve baskets full.
Luke	Luke	42	9	18	And it happened that while He was praying alone, the disciples were with Him, and He questioned them, saying, "Who do the people say that I am?"
Luke	Luke	42	9	19	They answered and said, "John the Baptist, and others say Elijah; but others, that one of the prophets of old has risen again."
Luke	Luke	42	9	20	And He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?" And Peter answered and said, "The Christ of God."
Luke	Luke	42	9	21	But He warned them and instructed them not to tell this to anyone,
Luke	Luke	42	9	22	saying, "The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed and be raised up on the third day."
Luke	Luke	42	9	23	And He was saying to them all, "If anyone wishes to come after Me, he must deny himself, and take up his cross daily and follow Me.
Luke	Luke	42	9	24	"For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake, he is the one who will save it.
Luke	Luke	42	9	25	"For what is a man profited if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits himself?
Luke	Luke	42	9	26	"For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when He comes in His glory, and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.
Luke	Luke	42	9	27	"But I say to you truthfully, there are some of those standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God."
Luke	Luke	42	9	28	Some eight days after these sayings, He took along Peter and John and James, and went up on the mountain to pray.
Luke	Luke	42	9	29	And while He was praying, the appearance of His face became different, and His clothing became white and gleaming.
Luke	Luke	42	9	30	And behold, two men were talking with Him; and they were Moses and Elijah,
Luke	Luke	42	9	31	who, appearing in glory, were speaking of His departure which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.
Luke	Luke	42	9	32	Now Peter and his companions had been overcome with sleep; but when they were fully awake, they saw His glory and the two men standing with Him.
Luke	Luke	42	9	33	And as these were leaving Him, Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it is good for us to be here; let us make three tabernacles: one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah"--not realizing what he was saying.
Luke	Luke	42	9	34	While he was saying this, a cloud formed and began to overshadow them; and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.
Luke	Luke	42	9	35	Then a voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is My Son, My Chosen One; listen to Him!"
Luke	Luke	42	9	36	And when the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent, and reported to no one in those days any of the things which they had seen.
Luke	Luke	42	9	37	On the next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met Him.
Luke	Luke	42	9	38	And a man from the crowd shouted, saying, "Teacher, I beg You to look at my son, for he is my only boy,
Luke	Luke	42	9	39	and a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly screams, and it throws him into a convulsion with foaming at the mouth; and only with difficulty does it leave him, mauling him as it leaves.
Luke	Luke	42	9	40	"I begged Your disciples to cast it out, and they could not."
Luke	Luke	42	9	41	And Jesus answered and said, "You unbelieving and perverted generation, how long shall I be with you and put up with you? Bring your son here."
Luke	Luke	42	9	42	While he was still approaching, the demon slammed him to the ground and threw him into a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy and gave him back to his father.
Luke	Luke	42	9	43	And they were all amazed at the greatness of God. But while everyone was marveling at all that He was doing, He said to His disciples,
Luke	Luke	42	9	44	"Let these words sink into your ears; for the Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men."
Luke	Luke	42	9	45	But they did not understand this statement, and it was concealed from them so that they would not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask Him about this statement.
Luke	Luke	42	9	46	An argument started among them as to which of them might be the greatest.
Luke	Luke	42	9	47	But Jesus, knowing what they were thinking in their heart, took a child and stood him by His side,
Luke	Luke	42	9	48	and said to them, "Whoever receives this child in My name receives Me, and whoever receives Me receives Him who sent Me; for the one who is least among all of you, this is the one who is great."
Luke	Luke	42	9	49	John answered and said, "Master, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name; and we tried to prevent him because he does not follow along with us."
Luke	Luke	42	9	50	But Jesus said to him, "Do not hinder him; for he who is not against you is for you."
Luke	Luke	42	9	51	When the days were approaching for His ascension, He was determined to go to Jerusalem;
Luke	Luke	42	9	52	and He sent messengers on ahead of Him, and they went and entered a village of the Samaritans to make arrangements for Him.
Luke	Luke	42	9	53	But they did not receive Him, because He was traveling toward Jerusalem.
Luke	Luke	42	9	54	When His disciples James and John saw this, they said, "Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?"
Luke	Luke	42	9	55	But He turned and rebuked them, [and said, "You do not know what kind of spirit you are of;
Luke	Luke	42	9	56	for the Son of Man did not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them."] And they went on to another village.
Luke	Luke	42	9	57	As they were going along the road, someone said to Him, "I will follow You wherever You go."
Luke	Luke	42	9	58	And Jesus said to him, "The foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head."
Luke	Luke	42	9	59	And He said to another, "Follow Me." But he said, "Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father."
Luke	Luke	42	9	60	But He said to him, "Allow the dead to bury their own dead; but as for you, go and proclaim everywhere the kingdom of God."
Luke	Luke	42	9	61	Another also said, "I will follow You, Lord; but first permit me to say good-bye to those at home."
Luke	Luke	42	9	62	But Jesus said to him, "No one, after putting his hand to the plow and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God."
Luke	Luke	42	10	1	Now after this the Lord appointed seventy others, and sent them in pairs ahead of Him to every city and place where He Himself was going to come.
Luke	Luke	42	10	2	And He was saying to them, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.
Luke	Luke	42	10	3	"Go; behold, I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves.
Luke	Luke	42	10	4	"Carry no money belt, no bag, no shoes; and greet no one on the way.
Luke	Luke	42	10	5	"Whatever house you enter, first say, 'Peace be to this house.'
Luke	Luke	42	10	6	"If a man of peace is there, your peace will rest on him; but if not, it will return to you.
Luke	Luke	42	10	7	"Stay in that house, eating and drinking what they give you; for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Do not keep moving from house to house.
Luke	Luke	42	10	8	"Whatever city you enter and they receive you, eat what is set before you;
Luke	Luke	42	10	9	and heal those in it who are sick, and say to them, 'The kingdom of God has come near to you.'
Luke	Luke	42	10	10	"But whatever city you enter and they do not receive you, go out into its streets and say,
Luke	Luke	42	10	11	'Even the dust of your city which clings to our feet we wipe off in protest against you; yet be sure of this, that the kingdom of God has come near.'
Luke	Luke	42	10	12	"I say to you, it will be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city.
Luke	Luke	42	10	13	"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles had been performed in Tyre and Sidon which occurred in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
Luke	Luke	42	10	14	"But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.
Luke	Luke	42	10	15	"And you, Capernaum, will not be exalted to heaven, will you? You will be brought down to Hades!
Luke	Luke	42	10	16	"The one who listens to you listens to Me, and the one who rejects you rejects Me; and he who rejects Me rejects the One who sent Me."
Luke	Luke	42	10	17	The seventy returned with joy, saying, "Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name."
Luke	Luke	42	10	18	And He said to them, "I was watching Satan fall from heaven like lightning.
Luke	Luke	42	10	19	"Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing will injure you.
Luke	Luke	42	10	20	"Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are recorded in heaven."
Luke	Luke	42	10	21	At that very time He rejoiced greatly in the Holy Spirit, and said, "I praise You, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants. Yes, Father, for this way was well-pleasing in Your sight.
Luke	Luke	42	10	22	"All things have been handed over to Me by My Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son wills to reveal Him."
Luke	Luke	42	10	23	Turning to the disciples, He said privately, "Blessed are the eyes which see the things you see,
Luke	Luke	42	10	24	for I say to you, that many prophets and kings wished to see the things which you see, and did not see them, and to hear the things which you hear, and did not hear them."
Luke	Luke	42	10	25	And a lawyer stood up and put Him to the test, saying, "Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
Luke	Luke	42	10	26	And He said to him, "What is written in the Law? How does it read to you?"
Luke	Luke	42	10	27	And he answered, "YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR STRENGTH, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND; AND YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF."
Luke	Luke	42	10	28	And He said to him, "You have answered correctly; DO THIS AND YOU WILL LIVE."
Luke	Luke	42	10	29	But wishing to justify himself, he said to Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?"
Luke	Luke	42	10	30	Jesus replied and said, "A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers, and they stripped him and beat him, and went away leaving him half dead.
Luke	Luke	42	10	31	"And by chance a priest was going down on that road, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
Luke	Luke	42	10	32	"Likewise a Levite also, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.
Luke	Luke	42	10	33	"But a Samaritan, who was on a journey, came upon him; and when he saw him, he felt compassion,
Luke	Luke	42	10	34	and came to him and bandaged up his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them; and he put him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn and took care of him.
Luke	Luke	42	10	35	"On the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper and said, 'Take care of him; and whatever more you spend, when I return I will repay you.'
Luke	Luke	42	10	36	"Which of these three do you think proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell into the robbers' hands?"
Luke	Luke	42	10	37	And he said, "The one who showed mercy toward him." Then Jesus said to him, "Go and do the same."
Luke	Luke	42	10	38	Now as they were traveling along, He entered a village; and a woman named Martha welcomed Him into her home.
Luke	Luke	42	10	39	She had a sister called Mary, who was seated at the Lord's feet, listening to His word.
Luke	Luke	42	10	40	But Martha was distracted with all her preparations; and she came up to Him and said, "Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to do all the serving alone? Then tell her to help me."
Luke	Luke	42	10	41	But the Lord answered and said to her, "Martha, Martha, you are worried and bothered about so many things;
Luke	Luke	42	10	42	but only one thing is necessary, for Mary has chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her."
Luke	Luke	42	11	1	It happened that while Jesus was praying in a certain place, after He had finished, one of His disciples said to Him, "Lord, teach us to pray just as John also taught his disciples."
Luke	Luke	42	11	2	And He said to them, "When you pray, say: 'Father, hallowed be Your name. Your kingdom come.
Luke	Luke	42	11	3	'Give us each day our daily bread.
Luke	Luke	42	11	4	'And forgive us our sins, For we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation.'"
Luke	Luke	42	11	5	Then He said to them, "Suppose one of you has a friend, and goes to him at midnight and says to him, 'Friend, lend me three loaves;
Luke	Luke	42	11	6	for a friend of mine has come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him';
Luke	Luke	42	11	7	and from inside he answers and says, 'Do not bother me; the door has already been shut and my children and I are in bed; I cannot get up and give you anything.'
Luke	Luke	42	11	8	"I tell you, even though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence he will get up and give him as much as he needs.
Luke	Luke	42	11	9	"So I say to you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.
Luke	Luke	42	11	10	"For everyone who asks, receives; and he who seeks, finds; and to him who knocks, it will be opened.
Luke	Luke	42	11	11	"Now suppose one of you fathers is asked by his son for a fish; he will not give him a snake instead of a fish, will he?
Luke	Luke	42	11	12	"Or if he is asked for an egg, he will not give him a scorpion, will he?
Luke	Luke	42	11	13	"If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him?"
Luke	Luke	42	11	14	And He was casting out a demon, and it was mute; when the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke; and the crowds were amazed.
Luke	Luke	42	11	15	But some of them said, "He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."
Luke	Luke	42	11	16	Others, to test Him, were demanding of Him a sign from heaven.
Luke	Luke	42	11	17	But He knew their thoughts and said to them, "Any kingdom divided against itself is laid waste; and a house divided against itself falls.
Luke	Luke	42	11	18	"If Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul.
Luke	Luke	42	11	19	"And if I by Beelzebul cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? So they will be your judges.
Luke	Luke	42	11	20	"But if I cast out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
Luke	Luke	42	11	21	"When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house, his possessions are undisturbed.
Luke	Luke	42	11	22	"But when someone stronger than he attacks him and overpowers him, he takes away from him all his armor on which he had relied and distributes his plunder.
Luke	Luke	42	11	23	"He who is not with Me is against Me; and he who does not gather with Me, scatters.
Luke	Luke	42	11	24	"When the unclean spirit goes out of a man, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, and not finding any, it says, 'I will return to my house from which I came.'
Luke	Luke	42	11	25	"And when it comes, it finds it swept and put in order.
Luke	Luke	42	11	26	"Then it goes and takes along seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they go in and live there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first."
Luke	Luke	42	11	27	While Jesus was saying these things, one of the women in the crowd raised her voice and said to Him, "Blessed is the womb that bore You and the breasts at which You nursed."
Luke	Luke	42	11	28	But He said, "On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of God and observe it."
Luke	Luke	42	11	29	As the crowds were increasing, He began to say, "This generation is a wicked generation; it seeks for a sign, and yet no sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah.
Luke	Luke	42	11	30	"For just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so will the Son of Man be to this generation.
Luke	Luke	42	11	31	"The Queen of the South will rise up with the men of this generation at the judgment and condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.
Luke	Luke	42	11	32	"The men of Nineveh will stand up with this generation at the judgment and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
Luke	Luke	42	11	33	"No one, after lighting a lamp, puts it away in a cellar nor under a basket, but on the lampstand, so that those who enter may see the light.
Luke	Luke	42	11	34	"The eye is the lamp of your body; when your eye is clear, your whole body also is full of light; but when it is bad, your body also is full of darkness.
Luke	Luke	42	11	35	"Then watch out that the light in you is not darkness.
Luke	Luke	42	11	36	"If therefore your whole body is full of light, with no dark part in it, it will be wholly illumined, as when the lamp illumines you with its rays."
Luke	Luke	42	11	37	Now when He had spoken, a Pharisee *asked Him to have lunch with him; and He went in, and reclined at the table.
Luke	Luke	42	11	38	When the Pharisee saw it, he was surprised that He had not first ceremonially washed before the meal.
Luke	Luke	42	11	39	But the Lord said to him, "Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and of the platter; but inside of you, you are full of robbery and wickedness.
Luke	Luke	42	11	40	"You foolish ones, did not He who made the outside make the inside also?
Luke	Luke	42	11	41	"But give that which is within as charity, and then all things are clean for you.
Luke	Luke	42	11	42	"But woe to you Pharisees! For you pay tithe of mint and rue and every kind of garden herb, and yet disregard justice and the love of God; but these are the things you should have done without neglecting the others.
Luke	Luke	42	11	43	"Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the chief seats in the synagogues and the respectful greetings in the market places.
Luke	Luke	42	11	44	"Woe to you! For you are like concealed tombs, and the people who walk over them are unaware of it."
Luke	Luke	42	11	45	One of the lawyers *said to Him in reply, "Teacher, when You say this, You insult us too."
Luke	Luke	42	11	46	But He said, "Woe to you lawyers as well! For you weigh men down with burdens hard to bear, while you yourselves will not even touch the burdens with one of your fingers.
Luke	Luke	42	11	47	"Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and it was your fathers who killed them.
Luke	Luke	42	11	48	"So you are witnesses and approve the deeds of your fathers; because it was they who killed them, and you build their tombs.
Luke	Luke	42	11	49	"For this reason also the wisdom of God said, 'I will send to them prophets and apostles, and some of them they will kill and some they will persecute,
Luke	Luke	42	11	50	so that the blood of all the prophets, shed since the foundation of the world, may be charged against this generation,
Luke	Luke	42	11	51	from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the house of God; yes, I tell you, it shall be charged against this generation.'
Luke	Luke	42	11	52	"Woe to you lawyers! For you have taken away the key of knowledge; you yourselves did not enter, and you hindered those who were entering."
Luke	Luke	42	11	53	When He left there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be very hostile and to question Him closely on many subjects,
Luke	Luke	42	11	54	plotting against Him to catch Him in something He might say.
Luke	Luke	42	12	1	Under these circumstances, after so many thousands of people had gathered together that they were stepping on one another, He began saying to His disciples first of all, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
Luke	Luke	42	12	2	"But there is nothing covered up that will not be revealed, and hidden that will not be known.
Luke	Luke	42	12	3	"Accordingly, whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have whispered in the inner rooms will be proclaimed upon the housetops.
Luke	Luke	42	12	4	"I say to you, My friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that have no more that they can do.
Luke	Luke	42	12	5	"But I will warn you whom to fear: fear the One who, after He has killed, has authority to cast into hell; yes, I tell you, fear Him!
Luke	Luke	42	12	6	"Are not five sparrows sold for two cents? Yet not one of them is forgotten before God.
Luke	Luke	42	12	7	"Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Do not fear; you are more valuable than many sparrows.
Luke	Luke	42	12	8	"And I say to you, everyone who confesses Me before men, the Son of Man will confess him also before the angels of God;
Luke	Luke	42	12	9	but he who denies Me before men will be denied before the angels of God.
Luke	Luke	42	12	10	"And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him.
Luke	Luke	42	12	11	"When they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities, do not worry about how or what you are to speak in your defense, or what you are to say;
Luke	Luke	42	12	12	for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say."
Luke	Luke	42	12	13	Someone in the crowd said to Him, "Teacher, tell my brother to divide the family inheritance with me."
Luke	Luke	42	12	14	But He said to him, "Man, who appointed Me a judge or arbitrator over you?"
Luke	Luke	42	12	15	Then He said to them, "Beware, and be on your guard against every form of greed; for not even when one has an abundance does his life consist of his possessions."
Luke	Luke	42	12	16	And He told them a parable, saying, "The land of a rich man was very productive.
Luke	Luke	42	12	17	"And he began reasoning to himself, saying, 'What shall I do, since I have no place to store my crops?'
Luke	Luke	42	12	18	"Then he said, 'This is what I will do: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.
Luke	Luke	42	12	19	'And I will say to my soul, "Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years to come; take your ease, eat, drink and be merry."'
Luke	Luke	42	12	20	"But God said to him, 'You fool! This very night your soul is required of you; and now who will own what you have prepared?'
Luke	Luke	42	12	21	"So is the man who stores up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God."
Luke	Luke	42	12	22	And He said to His disciples, "For this reason I say to you, do not worry about your life, as to what you will eat; nor for your body, as to what you will put on.
Luke	Luke	42	12	23	"For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing.
Luke	Luke	42	12	24	"Consider the ravens, for they neither sow nor reap; they have no storeroom nor barn, and yet God feeds them; how much more valuable you are than the birds!
Luke	Luke	42	12	25	"And which of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life's span?
Luke	Luke	42	12	26	"If then you cannot do even a very little thing, why do you worry about other matters?
Luke	Luke	42	12	27	"Consider the lilies, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin; but I tell you, not even Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these.
Luke	Luke	42	12	28	"But if God so clothes the grass in the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, how much more will He clothe you? You men of little faith!
Luke	Luke	42	12	29	"And do not seek what you will eat and what you will drink, and do not keep worrying.
Luke	Luke	42	12	30	"For all these things the nations of the world eagerly seek; but your Father knows that you need these things.
Luke	Luke	42	12	31	"But seek His kingdom, and these things will be added to you.
Luke	Luke	42	12	32	"Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has chosen gladly to give you the kingdom.
Luke	Luke	42	12	33	"Sell your possessions and give to charity; make yourselves money belts which do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near nor moth destroys.
Luke	Luke	42	12	34	"For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
Luke	Luke	42	12	35	"Be dressed in readiness, and keep your lamps lit.
Luke	Luke	42	12	36	"Be like men who are waiting for their master when he returns from the wedding feast, so that they may immediately open the door to him when he comes and knocks.
Luke	Luke	42	12	37	"Blessed are those slaves whom the master will find on the alert when he comes; truly I say to you, that he will gird himself to serve, and have them recline at the table, and will come up and wait on them.
Luke	Luke	42	12	38	"Whether he comes in the second watch, or even in the third, and finds them so, blessed are those slaves.
Luke	Luke	42	12	39	"But be sure of this, that if the head of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have allowed his house to be broken into.
Luke	Luke	42	12	40	"You too, be ready; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour that you do not expect."
Luke	Luke	42	12	41	Peter said, "Lord, are You addressing this parable to us, or to everyone else as well?"
Luke	Luke	42	12	42	And the Lord said, "Who then is the faithful and sensible steward, whom his master will put in charge of his servants, to give them their rations at the proper time?
Luke	Luke	42	12	43	"Blessed is that slave whom his master finds so doing when he comes.
Luke	Luke	42	12	44	"Truly I say to you that he will put him in charge of all his possessions.
Luke	Luke	42	12	45	"But if that slave says in his heart, 'My master will be a long time in coming,' and begins to beat the slaves, both men and women, and to eat and drink and get drunk;
Luke	Luke	42	12	46	the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know, and will cut him in pieces, and assign him a place with the unbelievers.
Luke	Luke	42	12	47	"And that slave who knew his master's will and did not get ready or act in accord with his will, will receive many lashes,
Luke	Luke	42	12	48	but the one who did not know it, and committed deeds worthy of a flogging, will receive but few. From everyone who has been given much, much will be required; and to whom they entrusted much, of him they will ask all the more.
Luke	Luke	42	12	49	"I have come to cast fire upon the earth; and how I wish it were already kindled!
Luke	Luke	42	12	50	"But I have a baptism to undergo, and how distressed I am until it is accomplished!
Luke	Luke	42	12	51	"Do you suppose that I came to grant peace on earth? I tell you, no, but rather division;
Luke	Luke	42	12	52	for from now on five members in one household will be divided, three against two and two against three.
Luke	Luke	42	12	53	"They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law."
Luke	Luke	42	12	54	And He was also saying to the crowds, "When you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately you say, 'A shower is coming,' and so it turns out.
Luke	Luke	42	12	55	"And when you see a south wind blowing, you say, 'It will be a hot day,' and it turns out that way.
Luke	Luke	42	12	56	"You hypocrites! You know how to analyze the appearance of the earth and the sky, but why do you not analyze this present time?
Luke	Luke	42	12	57	"And why do you not even on your own initiative judge what is right?
Luke	Luke	42	12	58	"For while you are going with your opponent to appear before the magistrate, on your way there make an effort to settle with him, so that he may not drag you before the judge, and the judge turn you over to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.
Luke	Luke	42	12	59	"I say to you, you will not get out of there until you have paid the very last cent."
Luke	Luke	42	13	1	Now on the same occasion there were some present who reported to Him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.
Luke	Luke	42	13	2	And Jesus said to them, "Do you suppose that these Galileans were greater sinners than all other Galileans because they suffered this fate?
Luke	Luke	42	13	3	"I tell you, no, but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.
Luke	Luke	42	13	4	"Or do you suppose that those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them were worse culprits than all the men who live in Jerusalem?
Luke	Luke	42	13	5	"I tell you, no, but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish."
Luke	Luke	42	13	6	And He began telling this parable: "A man had a fig tree which had been planted in his vineyard; and he came looking for fruit on it and did not find any.
Luke	Luke	42	13	7	"And he said to the vineyard-keeper, 'Behold, for three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree without finding any. Cut it down! Why does it even use up the ground?'
Luke	Luke	42	13	8	"And he answered and said to him, 'Let it alone, sir, for this year too, until I dig around it and put in fertilizer;
Luke	Luke	42	13	9	and if it bears fruit next year, fine; but if not, cut it down.'"
Luke	Luke	42	13	10	And He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.
Luke	Luke	42	13	11	And there was a woman who for eighteen years had had a sickness caused by a spirit; and she was bent double, and could not straighten up at all.
Luke	Luke	42	13	12	When Jesus saw her, He called her over and said to her, "Woman, you are freed from your sickness."
Luke	Luke	42	13	13	And He laid His hands on her; and immediately she was made erect again and began glorifying God.
Luke	Luke	42	13	14	But the synagogue official, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, began saying to the crowd in response, "There are six days in which work should be done; so come during them and get healed, and not on the Sabbath day."
Luke	Luke	42	13	15	But the Lord answered him and said, "You hypocrites, does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the stall and lead him away to water him?
Luke	Luke	42	13	16	"And this woman, a daughter of Abraham as she is, whom Satan has bound for eighteen long years, should she not have been released from this bond on the Sabbath day?"
Luke	Luke	42	13	17	As He said this, all His opponents were being humiliated; and the entire crowd was rejoicing over all the glorious things being done by Him.
Luke	Luke	42	13	18	So He was saying, "What is the kingdom of God like, and to what shall I compare it?
Luke	Luke	42	13	19	"It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and threw into his own garden; and it grew and became a tree, and THE BIRDS OF THE AIR NESTED IN ITS BRANCHES."
Luke	Luke	42	13	20	And again He said, "To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?
Luke	Luke	42	13	21	"It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three pecks of flour until it was all leavened."
Luke	Luke	42	13	22	And He was passing through from one city and village to another, teaching, and proceeding on His way to Jerusalem.
Luke	Luke	42	13	23	And someone said to Him, "Lord, are there just a few who are being saved?" And He said to them,
Luke	Luke	42	13	24	"Strive to enter through the narrow door; for many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able.
Luke	Luke	42	13	25	"Once the head of the house gets up and shuts the door, and you begin to stand outside and knock on the door, saying, 'Lord, open up to us!' then He will answer and say to you, 'I do not know where you are from.'
Luke	Luke	42	13	26	"Then you will begin to say, 'We ate and drank in Your presence, and You taught in our streets';
Luke	Luke	42	13	27	and He will say, 'I tell you, I do not know where you are from; DEPART FROM ME, ALL YOU EVILDOERS.'
Luke	Luke	42	13	28	"In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but yourselves being thrown out.
Luke	Luke	42	13	29	"And they will come from east and west and from north and south, and will recline at the table in the kingdom of God.
Luke	Luke	42	13	30	"And behold, some are last who will be first and some are first who will be last."
Luke	Luke	42	13	31	Just at that time some Pharisees approached, saying to Him, "Go away, leave here, for Herod wants to kill You."
Luke	Luke	42	13	32	And He said to them, "Go and tell that fox, 'Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I reach My goal.'
Luke	Luke	42	13	33	"Nevertheless I must journey on today and tomorrow and the next day; for it cannot be that a prophet would perish outside of Jerusalem.
Luke	Luke	42	13	34	"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, just as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not have it!
Luke	Luke	42	13	35	"Behold, your house is left to you desolate; and I say to you, you will not see Me until the time comes when you say, 'BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD!'"
Luke	Luke	42	14	1	It happened that when He went into the house of one of the leaders of the Pharisees on the Sabbath to eat bread, they were watching Him closely.
Luke	Luke	42	14	2	And there in front of Him was a man suffering from dropsy.
Luke	Luke	42	14	3	And Jesus answered and spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not?"
Luke	Luke	42	14	4	But they kept silent. And He took hold of him and healed him, and sent him away.
Luke	Luke	42	14	5	And He said to them, "Which one of you will have a son or an ox fall into a well, and will not immediately pull him out on a Sabbath day?"
Luke	Luke	42	14	6	And they could make no reply to this.
Luke	Luke	42	14	7	And He began speaking a parable to the invited guests when He noticed how they had been picking out the places of honor at the table, saying to them,
Luke	Luke	42	14	8	"When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor, for someone more distinguished than you may have been invited by him,
Luke	Luke	42	14	9	and he who invited you both will come and say to you, 'Give your place to this man,' and then in disgrace you proceed to occupy the last place.
Luke	Luke	42	14	10	"But when you are invited, go and recline at the last place, so that when the one who has invited you comes, he may say to you, 'Friend, move up higher'; then you will have honor in the sight of all who are at the table with you.
Luke	Luke	42	14	11	"For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted."
Luke	Luke	42	14	12	And He also went on to say to the one who had invited Him, "When you give a luncheon or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, otherwise they may also invite you in return and that will be your repayment.
Luke	Luke	42	14	13	"But when you give a reception, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind,
Luke	Luke	42	14	14	and you will be blessed, since they do not have the means to repay you; for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous."
Luke	Luke	42	14	15	When one of those who were reclining at the table with Him heard this, he said to Him, "Blessed is everyone who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!"
Luke	Luke	42	14	16	But He said to him, "A man was giving a big dinner, and he invited many;
Luke	Luke	42	14	17	and at the dinner hour he sent his slave to say to those who had been invited, 'Come; for everything is ready now.'
Luke	Luke	42	14	18	"But they all alike began to make excuses. The first one said to him, 'I have bought a piece of land and I need to go out and look at it; please consider me excused.'
Luke	Luke	42	14	19	"Another one said, 'I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to try them out; please consider me excused.'
Luke	Luke	42	14	20	"Another one said, 'I have married a wife, and for that reason I cannot come.'
Luke	Luke	42	14	21	"And the slave came back and reported this to his master. Then the head of the household became angry and said to his slave, 'Go out at once into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in here the poor and crippled and blind and lame.'
Luke	Luke	42	14	22	"And the slave said, 'Master, what you commanded has been done, and still there is room.'
Luke	Luke	42	14	23	"And the master said to the slave, 'Go out into the highways and along the hedges, and compel them to come in, so that my house may be filled.
Luke	Luke	42	14	24	'For I tell you, none of those men who were invited shall taste of my dinner.'"
Luke	Luke	42	14	25	Now large crowds were going along with Him; and He turned and said to them,
Luke	Luke	42	14	26	"If anyone comes to Me, and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be My disciple.
Luke	Luke	42	14	27	"Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple.
Luke	Luke	42	14	28	"For which one of you, when he wants to build a tower, does not first sit down and calculate the cost to see if he has enough to complete it?
Luke	Luke	42	14	29	"Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who observe it begin to ridicule him,
Luke	Luke	42	14	30	saying, 'This man began to build and was not able to finish.'
Luke	Luke	42	14	31	"Or what king, when he sets out to meet another king in battle, will not first sit down and consider whether he is strong enough with ten thousand men to encounter the one coming against him with twenty thousand?
Luke	Luke	42	14	32	"Or else, while the other is still far away, he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace.
Luke	Luke	42	14	33	"So then, none of you can be My disciple who does not give up all his own possessions.
Luke	Luke	42	14	34	"Therefore, salt is good; but if even salt has become tasteless, with what will it be seasoned?
Luke	Luke	42	14	35	"It is useless either for the soil or for the manure pile; it is thrown out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
Luke	Luke	42	15	1	Now all the tax collectors and the sinners were coming near Him to listen to Him.
Luke	Luke	42	15	2	Both the Pharisees and the scribes began to grumble, saying, "This man receives sinners and eats with them."
Luke	Luke	42	15	3	So He told them this parable, saying,
Luke	Luke	42	15	4	"What man among you, if he has a hundred sheep and has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the open pasture and go after the one which is lost until he finds it?
Luke	Luke	42	15	5	"When he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.
Luke	Luke	42	15	6	"And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!'
Luke	Luke	42	15	7	"I tell you that in the same way, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.
Luke	Luke	42	15	8	"Or what woman, if she has ten silver coins and loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it?
Luke	Luke	42	15	9	"When she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin which I had lost!'
Luke	Luke	42	15	10	"In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents."
Luke	Luke	42	15	11	And He said, "A man had two sons.
Luke	Luke	42	15	12	"The younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me the share of the estate that falls to me.' So he divided his wealth between them.
Luke	Luke	42	15	13	"And not many days later, the younger son gathered everything together and went on a journey into a distant country, and there he squandered his estate with loose living.
Luke	Luke	42	15	14	"Now when he had spent everything, a severe famine occurred in that country, and he began to be impoverished.
Luke	Luke	42	15	15	"So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.
Luke	Luke	42	15	16	"And he would have gladly filled his stomach with the pods that the swine were eating, and no one was giving anything to him.
Luke	Luke	42	15	17	"But when he came to his senses, he said, 'How many of my father's hired men have more than enough bread, but I am dying here with hunger!
Luke	Luke	42	15	18	'I will get up and go to my father, and will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight;
Luke	Luke	42	15	19	I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me as one of your hired men."'
Luke	Luke	42	15	20	"So he got up and came to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion for him, and ran and embraced him and kissed him.
Luke	Luke	42	15	21	"And the son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.'
Luke	Luke	42	15	22	"But the father said to his slaves, 'Quickly bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet;
Luke	Luke	42	15	23	and bring the fattened calf, kill it, and let us eat and celebrate;
Luke	Luke	42	15	24	for this son of mine was dead and has come to life again; he was lost and has been found.' And they began to celebrate.
Luke	Luke	42	15	25	"Now his older son was in the field, and when he came and approached the house, he heard music and dancing.
Luke	Luke	42	15	26	"And he summoned one of the servants and began inquiring what these things could be.
Luke	Luke	42	15	27	"And he said to him, 'Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has received him back safe and sound.'
Luke	Luke	42	15	28	"But he became angry and was not willing to go in; and his father came out and began pleading with him.
Luke	Luke	42	15	29	"But he answered and said to his father, 'Look! For so many years I have been serving you and I have never neglected a command of yours; and yet you have never given me a young goat, so that I might celebrate with my friends;
Luke	Luke	42	15	30	but when this son of yours came, who has devoured your wealth with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him.'
Luke	Luke	42	15	31	"And he said to him, 'Son, you have always been with me, and all that is mine is yours.
Luke	Luke	42	15	32	'But we had to celebrate and rejoice, for this brother of yours was dead and has begun to live, and was lost and has been found.'"
Luke	Luke	42	16	1	Now He was also saying to the disciples, "There was a rich man who had a manager, and this manager was reported to him as squandering his possessions.
Luke	Luke	42	16	2	"And he called him and said to him, 'What is this I hear about you? Give an accounting of your management, for you can no longer be manager.'
Luke	Luke	42	16	3	"The manager said to himself, 'What shall I do, since my master is taking the management away from me? I am not strong enough to dig; I am ashamed to beg.
Luke	Luke	42	16	4	'I know what I shall do, so that when I am removed from the management people will welcome me into their homes.'
Luke	Luke	42	16	5	"And he summoned each one of his master's debtors, and he began saying to the first, 'How much do you owe my master?'
Luke	Luke	42	16	6	"And he said, 'A hundred measures of oil.' And he said to him, 'Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.'
Luke	Luke	42	16	7	"Then he said to another, 'And how much do you owe?' And he said, 'A hundred measures of wheat.' He *said to him, 'Take your bill, and write eighty.'
Luke	Luke	42	16	8	"And his master praised the unrighteous manager because he had acted shrewdly; for the sons of this age are more shrewd in relation to their own kind than the sons of light.
Luke	Luke	42	16	9	"And I say to you, make friends for yourselves by means of the wealth of unrighteousness, so that when it fails, they will receive you into the eternal dwellings.
Luke	Luke	42	16	10	"He who is faithful in a very little thing is faithful also in much; and he who is unrighteous in a very little thing is unrighteous also in much.
Luke	Luke	42	16	11	"Therefore if you have not been faithful in the use of unrighteous wealth, who will entrust the true riches to you?
Luke	Luke	42	16	12	"And if you have not been faithful in the use of that which is another's, who will give you that which is your own?
Luke	Luke	42	16	13	"No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth."
Luke	Luke	42	16	14	Now the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, were listening to all these things and were scoffing at Him.
Luke	Luke	42	16	15	And He said to them, "You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men, but God knows your hearts; for that which is highly esteemed among men is detestable in the sight of God.
Luke	Luke	42	16	16	"The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John; since that time the gospel of the kingdom of God has been preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it.
Luke	Luke	42	16	17	"But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter of the Law to fail.
Luke	Luke	42	16	18	"Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries one who is divorced from a husband commits adultery.
Luke	Luke	42	16	19	"Now there was a rich man, and he habitually dressed in purple and fine linen, joyously living in splendor every day.
Luke	Luke	42	16	20	"And a poor man named Lazarus was laid at his gate, covered with sores,
Luke	Luke	42	16	21	and longing to be fed with the crumbs which were falling from the rich man's table; besides, even the dogs were coming and licking his sores.
Luke	Luke	42	16	22	"Now the poor man died and was carried away by the angels to Abraham's bosom; and the rich man also died and was buried.
Luke	Luke	42	16	23	"In Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and *saw Abraham far away and Lazarus in his bosom.
Luke	Luke	42	16	24	"And he cried out and said, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus so that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool off my tongue, for I am in agony in this flame.'
Luke	Luke	42	16	25	"But Abraham said, 'Child, remember that during your life you received your good things, and likewise Lazarus bad things; but now he is being comforted here, and you are in agony.
Luke	Luke	42	16	26	'And besides all this, between us and you there is a great chasm fixed, so that those who wish to come over from here to you will not be able, and that none may cross over from there to us.'
Luke	Luke	42	16	27	"And he said, 'Then I beg you, father, that you send him to my father's house--
Luke	Luke	42	16	28	for I have five brothers--in order that he may warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.'
Luke	Luke	42	16	29	"But Abraham *said, 'They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them.'
Luke	Luke	42	16	30	"But he said, 'No, father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent!'
Luke	Luke	42	16	31	"But he said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be persuaded even if someone rises from the dead.'"
Luke	Luke	42	17	1	He said to His disciples, "It is inevitable that stumbling blocks come, but woe to him through whom they come!
Luke	Luke	42	17	2	"It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea, than that he would cause one of these little ones to stumble.
Luke	Luke	42	17	3	"Be on your guard! If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.
Luke	Luke	42	17	4	"And if he sins against you seven times a day, and returns to you seven times, saying, 'I repent,' forgive him."
Luke	Luke	42	17	5	The apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our faith!"
Luke	Luke	42	17	6	And the Lord said, "If you had faith like a mustard seed, you would say to this mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and be planted in the sea'; and it would obey you.
Luke	Luke	42	17	7	"Which of you, having a slave plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, 'Come immediately and sit down to eat'?
Luke	Luke	42	17	8	"But will he not say to him, 'Prepare something for me to eat, and properly clothe yourself and serve me while I eat and drink; and afterward you may eat and drink'?
Luke	Luke	42	17	9	"He does not thank the slave because he did the things which were commanded, does he?
Luke	Luke	42	17	10	"So you too, when you do all the things which are commanded you, say, 'We are unworthy slaves; we have done only that which we ought to have done.'"
Luke	Luke	42	17	11	While He was on the way to Jerusalem, He was passing between Samaria and Galilee.
Luke	Luke	42	17	12	As He entered a village, ten leprous men who stood at a distance met Him;
Luke	Luke	42	17	13	and they raised their voices, saying, "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!"
Luke	Luke	42	17	14	When He saw them, He said to them, "Go and show yourselves to the priests." And as they were going, they were cleansed.
Luke	Luke	42	17	15	Now one of them, when he saw that he had been healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice,
Luke	Luke	42	17	16	and he fell on his face at His feet, giving thanks to Him. And he was a Samaritan.
Luke	Luke	42	17	17	Then Jesus answered and said, "Were there not ten cleansed? But the nine--where are they?
Luke	Luke	42	17	18	"Was no one found who returned to give glory to God, except this foreigner?"
Luke	Luke	42	17	19	And He said to him, "Stand up and go; your faith has made you well."
Luke	Luke	42	17	20	Now having been questioned by the Pharisees as to when the kingdom of God was coming, He answered them and said, "The kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed;
Luke	Luke	42	17	21	nor will they say, 'Look, here it is!' or, 'There it is!' For behold, the kingdom of God is in your midst."
Luke	Luke	42	17	22	And He said to the disciples, "The days will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it.
Luke	Luke	42	17	23	"They will say to you, 'Look there! Look here!' Do not go away, and do not run after them.
Luke	Luke	42	17	24	"For just like the lightning, when it flashes out of one part of the sky, shines to the other part of the sky, so will the Son of Man be in His day.
Luke	Luke	42	17	25	"But first He must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.
Luke	Luke	42	17	26	"And just as it happened in the days of Noah, so it will be also in the days of the Son of Man:
Luke	Luke	42	17	27	they were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were being given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.
Luke	Luke	42	17	28	"It was the same as happened in the days of Lot: they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building;
Luke	Luke	42	17	29	but on the day that Lot went out from Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all.
Luke	Luke	42	17	30	"It will be just the same on the day that the Son of Man is revealed.
Luke	Luke	42	17	31	"On that day, the one who is on the housetop and whose goods are in the house must not go down to take them out; and likewise the one who is in the field must not turn back.
Luke	Luke	42	17	32	"Remember Lot's wife.
Luke	Luke	42	17	33	"Whoever seeks to keep his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life will preserve it.
Luke	Luke	42	17	34	"I tell you, on that night there will be two in one bed; one will be taken and the other will be left.
Luke	Luke	42	17	35	"There will be two women grinding at the same place; one will be taken and the other will be left.
Luke	Luke	42	17	36	["Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other will be left."]
Luke	Luke	42	17	37	And answering they *said to Him, "Where, Lord?" And He said to them, "Where the body is, there also the vultures will be gathered."
Luke	Luke	42	18	1	Now He was telling them a parable to show that at all times they ought to pray and not to lose heart,
Luke	Luke	42	18	2	saying, "In a certain city there was a judge who did not fear God and did not respect man.
Luke	Luke	42	18	3	"There was a widow in that city, and she kept coming to him, saying, 'Give me legal protection from my opponent.'
Luke	Luke	42	18	4	"For a while he was unwilling; but afterward he said to himself, 'Even though I do not fear God nor respect man,
Luke	Luke	42	18	5	yet because this widow bothers me, I will give her legal protection, otherwise by continually coming she will wear me out.'"
Luke	Luke	42	18	6	And the Lord said, "Hear what the unrighteous judge *said;
Luke	Luke	42	18	7	now, will not God bring about justice for His elect who cry to Him day and night, and will He delay long over them?
Luke	Luke	42	18	8	"I tell you that He will bring about justice for them quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?"
Luke	Luke	42	18	9	And He also told this parable to some people who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and viewed others with contempt:
Luke	Luke	42	18	10	"Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.
Luke	Luke	42	18	11	"The Pharisee stood and was praying this to himself: 'God, I thank You that I am not like other people: swindlers, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.
Luke	Luke	42	18	12	'I fast twice a week; I pay tithes of all that I get.'
Luke	Luke	42	18	13	"But the tax collector, standing some distance away, was even unwilling to lift up his eyes to heaven, but was beating his breast, saying, 'God, be merciful to me, the sinner!'
Luke	Luke	42	18	14	"I tell you, this man went to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted."
Luke	Luke	42	18	15	And they were bringing even their babies to Him so that He would touch them, but when the disciples saw it, they began rebuking them.
Luke	Luke	42	18	16	But Jesus called for them, saying, "Permit the children to come to Me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
Luke	Luke	42	18	17	"Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it at all."
Luke	Luke	42	18	18	A ruler questioned Him, saying, "Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
Luke	Luke	42	18	19	And Jesus said to him, "Why do you call Me good? No one is good except God alone.
Luke	Luke	42	18	20	"You know the commandments, 'DO NOT COMMIT ADULTERY, DO NOT MURDER, DO NOT STEAL, DO NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS, HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER.'"
Luke	Luke	42	18	21	And he said, "All these things I have kept from my youth."
Luke	Luke	42	18	22	When Jesus heard this, He said to him, "One thing you still lack; sell all that you possess and distribute it to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me."
Luke	Luke	42	18	23	But when he had heard these things, he became very sad, for he was extremely rich.
Luke	Luke	42	18	24	And Jesus looked at him and said, "How hard it is for those who are wealthy to enter the kingdom of God!
Luke	Luke	42	18	25	"For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."
Luke	Luke	42	18	26	They who heard it said, "Then who can be saved?"
Luke	Luke	42	18	27	But He said, "The things that are impossible with people are possible with God."
Luke	Luke	42	18	28	Peter said, "Behold, we have left our own homes and followed You."
Luke	Luke	42	18	29	And He said to them, "Truly I say to you, there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,
Luke	Luke	42	18	30	who will not receive many times as much at this time and in the age to come, eternal life."
Luke	Luke	42	18	31	Then He took the twelve aside and said to them, "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things which are written through the prophets about the Son of Man will be accomplished.
Luke	Luke	42	18	32	"For He will be handed over to the Gentiles, and will be mocked and mistreated and spit upon,
Luke	Luke	42	18	33	and after they have scourged Him, they will kill Him; and the third day He will rise again."
Luke	Luke	42	18	34	But the disciples understood none of these things, and the meaning of this statement was hidden from them, and they did not comprehend the things that were said.
Luke	Luke	42	18	35	As Jesus was approaching Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the road begging.
Luke	Luke	42	18	36	Now hearing a crowd going by, he began to inquire what this was.
Luke	Luke	42	18	37	They told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.
Luke	Luke	42	18	38	And he called out, saying, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"
Luke	Luke	42	18	39	Those who led the way were sternly telling him to be quiet; but he kept crying out all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"
Luke	Luke	42	18	40	And Jesus stopped and commanded that he be brought to Him; and when he came near, He questioned him,
Luke	Luke	42	18	41	"What do you want Me to do for you?" And he said, "Lord, I want to regain my sight!"
Luke	Luke	42	18	42	And Jesus said to him, "Receive your sight; your faith has made you well."
Luke	Luke	42	18	43	Immediately he regained his sight and began following Him, glorifying God; and when all the people saw it, they gave praise to God.
Luke	Luke	42	19	1	He entered Jericho and was passing through.
Luke	Luke	42	19	2	And there was a man called by the name of Zaccheus; he was a chief tax collector and he was rich.
Luke	Luke	42	19	3	Zaccheus was trying to see who Jesus was, and was unable because of the crowd, for he was small in stature.
Luke	Luke	42	19	4	So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree in order to see Him, for He was about to pass through that way.
Luke	Luke	42	19	5	When Jesus came to the place, He looked up and said to him, "Zaccheus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house."
Luke	Luke	42	19	6	And he hurried and came down and received Him gladly.
Luke	Luke	42	19	7	When they saw it, they all began to grumble, saying, "He has gone to be the guest of a man who is a sinner."
Luke	Luke	42	19	8	Zaccheus stopped and said to the Lord, "Behold, Lord, half of my possessions I will give to the poor, and if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I will give back four times as much."
Luke	Luke	42	19	9	And Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has come to this house, because he, too, is a son of Abraham.
Luke	Luke	42	19	10	"For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost."
Luke	Luke	42	19	11	While they were listening to these things, Jesus went on to tell a parable, because He was near Jerusalem, and they supposed that the kingdom of God was going to appear immediately.
Luke	Luke	42	19	12	So He said, "A nobleman went to a distant country to receive a kingdom for himself, and then return.
Luke	Luke	42	19	13	"And he called ten of his slaves, and gave them ten minas and said to them, 'Do business with this until I come back.'
Luke	Luke	42	19	14	"But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, 'We do not want this man to reign over us.'
Luke	Luke	42	19	15	"When he returned, after receiving the kingdom, he ordered that these slaves, to whom he had given the money, be called to him so that he might know what business they had done.
Luke	Luke	42	19	16	"The first appeared, saying, 'Master, your mina has made ten minas more.'
Luke	Luke	42	19	17	"And he said to him, 'Well done, good slave, because you have been faithful in a very little thing, you are to be in authority over ten cities.'
Luke	Luke	42	19	18	"The second came, saying, 'Your mina, master, has made five minas.'
Luke	Luke	42	19	19	"And he said to him also, 'And you are to be over five cities.'
Luke	Luke	42	19	20	"Another came, saying, 'Master, here is your mina, which I kept put away in a handkerchief;
Luke	Luke	42	19	21	for I was afraid of you, because you are an exacting man; you take up what you did not lay down and reap what you did not sow.'
Luke	Luke	42	19	22	"He *said to him, 'By your own words I will judge you, you worthless slave. Did you know that I am an exacting man, taking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow?
Luke	Luke	42	19	23	'Then why did you not put my money in the bank, and having come, I would have collected it with interest?'
Luke	Luke	42	19	24	"Then he said to the bystanders, 'Take the mina away from him and give it to the one who has the ten minas.'
Luke	Luke	42	19	25	"And they said to him, 'Master, he has ten minas already.'
Luke	Luke	42	19	26	"I tell you that to everyone who has, more shall be given, but from the one who does not have, even what he does have shall be taken away.
Luke	Luke	42	19	27	"But these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slay them in my presence."
Luke	Luke	42	19	28	After He had said these things, He was going on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.
Luke	Luke	42	19	29	When He approached Bethphage and Bethany, near the mount that is called Olivet, He sent two of the disciples,
Luke	Luke	42	19	30	saying, "Go into the village ahead of you; there, as you enter, you will find a colt tied on which no one yet has ever sat; untie it and bring it here.
Luke	Luke	42	19	31	"If anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' you shall say, 'The Lord has need of it.'"
Luke	Luke	42	19	32	So those who were sent went away and found it just as He had told them.
Luke	Luke	42	19	33	As they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, "Why are you untying the colt?"
Luke	Luke	42	19	34	They said, "The Lord has need of it."
Luke	Luke	42	19	35	They brought it to Jesus, and they threw their coats on the colt and put Jesus on it.
Luke	Luke	42	19	36	As He was going, they were spreading their coats on the road.
Luke	Luke	42	19	37	As soon as He was approaching, near the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of the disciples began to praise God joyfully with a loud voice for all the miracles which they had seen,
Luke	Luke	42	19	38	shouting: "BLESSED IS THE KING WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD; Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!"
Luke	Luke	42	19	39	Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Him, "Teacher, rebuke Your disciples."
Luke	Luke	42	19	40	But Jesus answered, "I tell you, if these become silent, the stones will cry out!"
Luke	Luke	42	19	41	When He approached Jerusalem, He saw the city and wept over it,
Luke	Luke	42	19	42	saying, "If you had known in this day, even you, the things which make for peace! But now they have been hidden from your eyes.
Luke	Luke	42	19	43	"For the days will come upon you when your enemies will throw up a barricade against you, and surround you and hem you in on every side,
Luke	Luke	42	19	44	and they will level you to the ground and your children within you, and they will not leave in you one stone upon another, because you did not recognize the time of your visitation."
Luke	Luke	42	19	45	Jesus entered the temple and began to drive out those who were selling,
Luke	Luke	42	19	46	saying to them, "It is written, 'AND MY HOUSE SHALL BE A HOUSE OF PRAYER,' but you have made it a ROBBERS' DEN."
Luke	Luke	42	19	47	And He was teaching daily in the temple; but the chief priests and the scribes and the leading men among the people were trying to destroy Him,
Luke	Luke	42	19	48	and they could not find anything that they might do, for all the people were hanging on to every word He said.
Luke	Luke	42	20	1	On one of the days while He was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes with the elders confronted Him,
Luke	Luke	42	20	2	and they spoke, saying to Him, "Tell us by what authority You are doing these things, or who is the one who gave You this authority?"
Luke	Luke	42	20	3	Jesus answered and said to them, "I will also ask you a question, and you tell Me:
Luke	Luke	42	20	4	"Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men?"
Luke	Luke	42	20	5	They reasoned among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' He will say, 'Why did you not believe him?'
Luke	Luke	42	20	6	"But if we say, 'From men,' all the people will stone us to death, for they are convinced that John was a prophet."
Luke	Luke	42	20	7	So they answered that they did not know where it came from.
Luke	Luke	42	20	8	And Jesus said to them, "Nor will I tell you by what authority I do these things."
Luke	Luke	42	20	9	And He began to tell the people this parable: "A man planted a vineyard and rented it out to vine-growers, and went on a journey for a long time.
Luke	Luke	42	20	10	"At the harvest time he sent a slave to the vine-growers, so that they would give him some of the produce of the vineyard; but the vine-growers beat him and sent him away empty-handed.
Luke	Luke	42	20	11	"And he proceeded to send another slave; and they beat him also and treated him shamefully and sent him away empty-handed.
Luke	Luke	42	20	12	"And he proceeded to send a third; and this one also they wounded and cast out.
Luke	Luke	42	20	13	"The owner of the vineyard said, 'What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.'
Luke	Luke	42	20	14	"But when the vine-growers saw him, they reasoned with one another, saying, 'This is the heir; let us kill him so that the inheritance will be ours.'
Luke	Luke	42	20	15	"So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What, then, will the owner of the vineyard do to them?
Luke	Luke	42	20	16	"He will come and destroy these vine-growers and will give the vineyard to others." When they heard it, they said, "May it never be!"
Luke	Luke	42	20	17	But Jesus looked at them and said, "What then is this that is written: 'THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED, THIS BECAME THE CHIEF CORNER stone'?
Luke	Luke	42	20	18	"Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls, it will scatter him like dust."
Luke	Luke	42	20	19	The scribes and the chief priests tried to lay hands on Him that very hour, and they feared the people; for they understood that He spoke this parable against them.
Luke	Luke	42	20	20	So they watched Him, and sent spies who pretended to be righteous, in order that they might catch Him in some statement, so that they could deliver Him to the rule and the authority of the governor.
Luke	Luke	42	20	21	They questioned Him, saying, "Teacher, we know that You speak and teach correctly, and You are not partial to any, but teach the way of God in truth.
Luke	Luke	42	20	22	"Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?"
Luke	Luke	42	20	23	But He detected their trickery and said to them,
Luke	Luke	42	20	24	"Show Me a denarius. Whose likeness and inscription does it have?" They said, "Caesar's."
Luke	Luke	42	20	25	And He said to them, "Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
Luke	Luke	42	20	26	And they were unable to catch Him in a saying in the presence of the people; and being amazed at His answer, they became silent.
Luke	Luke	42	20	27	Now there came to Him some of the Sadducees (who say that there is no resurrection),
Luke	Luke	42	20	28	and they questioned Him, saying, "Teacher, Moses wrote for us that IF A MAN'S BROTHER DIES, having a wife, AND HE IS CHILDLESS, HIS BROTHER SHOULD MARRY THE WIFE AND RAISE UP CHILDREN TO HIS BROTHER.
Luke	Luke	42	20	29	"Now there were seven brothers; and the first took a wife and died childless;
Luke	Luke	42	20	30	and the second
Luke	Luke	42	20	31	and the third married her; and in the same way all seven died, leaving no children.
Luke	Luke	42	20	32	"Finally the woman died also.
Luke	Luke	42	20	33	"In the resurrection therefore, which one's wife will she be? For all seven had married her."
Luke	Luke	42	20	34	Jesus said to them, "The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage,
Luke	Luke	42	20	35	but those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage;
Luke	Luke	42	20	36	for they cannot even die anymore, because they are like angels, and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.
Luke	Luke	42	20	37	"But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed, in the passage about the burning bush, where he calls the Lord THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, AND THE GOD OF ISAAC, AND THE GOD OF JACOB.
Luke	Luke	42	20	38	"Now He is not the God of the dead but of the living; for all live to Him."
Luke	Luke	42	20	39	Some of the scribes answered and said, "Teacher, You have spoken well."
Luke	Luke	42	20	40	For they did not have courage to question Him any longer about anything.
Luke	Luke	42	20	41	Then He said to them, "How is it that they say the Christ is David's son?
Luke	Luke	42	20	42	"For David himself says in the book of Psalms, 'THE LORD SAID TO MY LORD, "SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND,
Luke	Luke	42	20	43	UNTIL I MAKE YOUR ENEMIES A FOOTSTOOL FOR YOUR FEET."'
Luke	Luke	42	20	44	"Therefore David calls Him 'Lord,' and how is He his son?"
Luke	Luke	42	20	45	And while all the people were listening, He said to the disciples,
Luke	Luke	42	20	46	"Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes, and love respectful greetings in the market places, and chief seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets,
Luke	Luke	42	20	47	who devour widows' houses, and for appearance's sake offer long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation."
Luke	Luke	42	21	1	And He looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury.
Luke	Luke	42	21	2	And He saw a poor widow putting in two small copper coins.
Luke	Luke	42	21	3	And He said, "Truly I say to you, this poor widow put in more than all of them;
Luke	Luke	42	21	4	for they all out of their surplus put into the offering; but she out of her poverty put in all that she had to live on."
Luke	Luke	42	21	5	And while some were talking about the temple, that it was adorned with beautiful stones and votive gifts, He said,
Luke	Luke	42	21	6	"As for these things which you are looking at, the days will come in which there will not be left one stone upon another which will not be torn down."
Luke	Luke	42	21	7	They questioned Him, saying, "Teacher, when therefore will these things happen? And what will be the sign when these things are about to take place?"
Luke	Luke	42	21	8	And He said, "See to it that you are not misled; for many will come in My name, saying, 'I am He,' and, 'The time is near.' Do not go after them.
Luke	Luke	42	21	9	"When you hear of wars and disturbances, do not be terrified; for these things must take place first, but the end does not follow immediately."
Luke	Luke	42	21	10	Then He continued by saying to them, "Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom,
Luke	Luke	42	21	11	and there will be great earthquakes, and in various places plagues and famines; and there will be terrors and great signs from heaven.
Luke	Luke	42	21	12	"But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you, delivering you to the synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors for My name's sake.
Luke	Luke	42	21	13	"It will lead to an opportunity for your testimony.
Luke	Luke	42	21	14	"So make up your minds not to prepare beforehand to defend yourselves;
Luke	Luke	42	21	15	for I will give you utterance and wisdom which none of your opponents will be able to resist or refute.
Luke	Luke	42	21	16	"But you will be betrayed even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and they will put some of you to death,
Luke	Luke	42	21	17	and you will be hated by all because of My name.
Luke	Luke	42	21	18	"Yet not a hair of your head will perish.
Luke	Luke	42	21	19	"By your endurance you will gain your lives.
Luke	Luke	42	21	20	"But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then recognize that her desolation is near.
Luke	Luke	42	21	21	"Then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains, and those who are in the midst of the city must leave, and those who are in the country must not enter the city;
Luke	Luke	42	21	22	because these are days of vengeance, so that all things which are written will be fulfilled.
Luke	Luke	42	21	23	"Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days; for there will be great distress upon the land and wrath to this people;
Luke	Luke	42	21	24	and they will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led captive into all the nations; and Jerusalem will be trampled under foot by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.
Luke	Luke	42	21	25	"There will be signs in sun and moon and stars, and on the earth dismay among nations, in perplexity at the roaring of the sea and the waves,
Luke	Luke	42	21	26	men fainting from fear and the expectation of the things which are coming upon the world; for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
Luke	Luke	42	21	27	"Then they will see THE SON OF MAN COMING IN A CLOUD with power and great glory.
Luke	Luke	42	21	28	"But when these things begin to take place, straighten up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near."
Luke	Luke	42	21	29	Then He told them a parable: "Behold the fig tree and all the trees;
Luke	Luke	42	21	30	as soon as they put forth leaves, you see it and know for yourselves that summer is now near.
Luke	Luke	42	21	31	"So you also, when you see these things happening, recognize that the kingdom of God is near.
Luke	Luke	42	21	32	"Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all things take place.
Luke	Luke	42	21	33	"Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away.
Luke	Luke	42	21	34	"Be on guard, so that your hearts will not be weighted down with dissipation and drunkenness and the worries of life, and that day will not come on you suddenly like a trap;
Luke	Luke	42	21	35	for it will come upon all those who dwell on the face of all the earth.
Luke	Luke	42	21	36	"But keep on the alert at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that are about to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man."
Luke	Luke	42	21	37	Now during the day He was teaching in the temple, but at evening He would go out and spend the night on the mount that is called Olivet.
Luke	Luke	42	21	38	And all the people would get up early in the morning to come to Him in the temple to listen to Him.
Luke	Luke	42	22	1	Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was approaching.
Luke	Luke	42	22	2	The chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they might put Him to death; for they were afraid of the people.
Luke	Luke	42	22	3	And Satan entered into Judas who was called Iscariot, belonging to the number of the twelve.
Luke	Luke	42	22	4	And he went away and discussed with the chief priests and officers how he might betray Him to them.
Luke	Luke	42	22	5	They were glad and agreed to give him money.
Luke	Luke	42	22	6	So he consented, and began seeking a good opportunity to betray Him to them apart from the crowd.
Luke	Luke	42	22	7	Then came the first day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.
Luke	Luke	42	22	8	And Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and prepare the Passover for us, so that we may eat it."
Luke	Luke	42	22	9	They said to Him, "Where do You want us to prepare it?"
Luke	Luke	42	22	10	And He said to them, "When you have entered the city, a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him into the house that he enters.
Luke	Luke	42	22	11	"And you shall say to the owner of the house, 'The Teacher says to you, "Where is the guest room in which I may eat the Passover with My disciples?"'
Luke	Luke	42	22	12	"And he will show you a large, furnished upper room; prepare it there."
Luke	Luke	42	22	13	And they left and found everything just as He had told them; and they prepared the Passover.
Luke	Luke	42	22	14	When the hour had come, He reclined at the table, and the apostles with Him.
Luke	Luke	42	22	15	And He said to them, "I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer;
Luke	Luke	42	22	16	for I say to you, I shall never again eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God."
Luke	Luke	42	22	17	And when He had taken a cup and given thanks, He said, "Take this and share it among yourselves;
Luke	Luke	42	22	18	for I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine from now on until the kingdom of God comes."
Luke	Luke	42	22	19	And when He had taken some bread and given thanks, He broke it and gave it to them, saying, "This is My body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of Me."
Luke	Luke	42	22	20	And in the same way He took the cup after they had eaten, saying, "This cup which is poured out for you is the new covenant in My blood.
Luke	Luke	42	22	21	"But behold, the hand of the one betraying Me is with Mine on the table.
Luke	Luke	42	22	22	"For indeed, the Son of Man is going as it has been determined; but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed!"
Luke	Luke	42	22	23	And they began to discuss among themselves which one of them it might be who was going to do this thing.
Luke	Luke	42	22	24	And there arose also a dispute among them as to which one of them was regarded to be greatest.
Luke	Luke	42	22	25	And He said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who have authority over them are called 'Benefactors.'
Luke	Luke	42	22	26	"But it is not this way with you, but the one who is the greatest among you must become like the youngest, and the leader like the servant.
Luke	Luke	42	22	27	"For who is greater, the one who reclines at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at the table? But I am among you as the one who serves.
Luke	Luke	42	22	28	"You are those who have stood by Me in My trials;
Luke	Luke	42	22	29	and just as My Father has granted Me a kingdom, I grant you
Luke	Luke	42	22	30	that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
Luke	Luke	42	22	31	"Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded permission to sift you like wheat;
Luke	Luke	42	22	32	but I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail; and you, when once you have turned again, strengthen your brothers."
Luke	Luke	42	22	33	But he said to Him, "Lord, with You I am ready to go both to prison and to death!"
Luke	Luke	42	22	34	And He said, "I say to you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know Me."
Luke	Luke	42	22	35	And He said to them, "When I sent you out without money belt and bag and sandals, you did not lack anything, did you?" They said, "No, nothing."
Luke	Luke	42	22	36	And He said to them, "But now, whoever has a money belt is to take it along, likewise also a bag, and whoever has no sword is to sell his coat and buy one.
Luke	Luke	42	22	37	"For I tell you that this which is written must be fulfilled in Me, 'AND HE WAS NUMBERED WITH TRANSGRESSORS'; for that which refers to Me has its fulfillment."
Luke	Luke	42	22	38	They said, "Lord, look, here are two swords." And He said to them, "It is enough."
Luke	Luke	42	22	39	And He came out and proceeded as was His custom to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples also followed Him.
Luke	Luke	42	22	40	When He arrived at the place, He said to them, "Pray that you may not enter into temptation."
Luke	Luke	42	22	41	And He withdrew from them about a stone's throw, and He knelt down and began to pray,
Luke	Luke	42	22	42	saying, "Father, if You are willing, remove this cup from Me; yet not My will, but Yours be done."
Luke	Luke	42	22	43	Now an angel from heaven appeared to Him, strengthening Him.
Luke	Luke	42	22	44	And being in agony He was praying very fervently; and His sweat became like drops of blood, falling down upon the ground.
Luke	Luke	42	22	45	When He rose from prayer, He came to the disciples and found them sleeping from sorrow,
Luke	Luke	42	22	46	and said to them, "Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray that you may not enter into temptation."
Luke	Luke	42	22	47	While He was still speaking, behold, a crowd came, and the one called Judas, one of the twelve, was preceding them; and he approached Jesus to kiss Him.
Luke	Luke	42	22	48	But Jesus said to him, "Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?"
Luke	Luke	42	22	49	When those who were around Him saw what was going to happen, they said, "Lord, shall we strike with the sword?"
Luke	Luke	42	22	50	And one of them struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear.
Luke	Luke	42	22	51	But Jesus answered and said, "Stop! No more of this." And He touched his ear and healed him.
Luke	Luke	42	22	52	Then Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders who had come against Him, "Have you come out with swords and clubs as you would against a robber?
Luke	Luke	42	22	53	"While I was with you daily in the temple, you did not lay hands on Me; but this hour and the power of darkness are yours."
Luke	Luke	42	22	54	Having arrested Him, they led Him away and brought Him to the house of the high priest; but Peter was following at a distance.
Luke	Luke	42	22	55	After they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter was sitting among them.
Luke	Luke	42	22	56	And a servant-girl, seeing him as he sat in the firelight and looking intently at him, said, "This man was with Him too."
Luke	Luke	42	22	57	But he denied it, saying, "Woman, I do not know Him."
Luke	Luke	42	22	58	A little later, another saw him and said, "You are one of them too!" But Peter said, "Man, I am not!"
Luke	Luke	42	22	59	After about an hour had passed, another man began to insist, saying, "Certainly this man also was with Him, for he is a Galilean too."
Luke	Luke	42	22	60	But Peter said, "Man, I do not know what you are talking about." Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.
Luke	Luke	42	22	61	The Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had told him, "Before a rooster crows today, you will deny Me three times."
Luke	Luke	42	22	62	And he went out and wept bitterly.
Luke	Luke	42	22	63	Now the men who were holding Jesus in custody were mocking Him and beating Him,
Luke	Luke	42	22	64	and they blindfolded Him and were asking Him, saying, "Prophesy, who is the one who hit You?"
Luke	Luke	42	22	65	And they were saying many other things against Him, blaspheming.
Luke	Luke	42	22	66	When it was day, the Council of elders of the people assembled, both chief priests and scribes, and they led Him away to their council chamber, saying,
Luke	Luke	42	22	67	"If You are the Christ, tell us." But He said to them, "If I tell you, you will not believe;
Luke	Luke	42	22	68	and if I ask a question, you will not answer.
Luke	Luke	42	22	69	"But from now on THE SON OF MAN WILL BE SEATED AT THE RIGHT HAND of the power OF GOD."
Luke	Luke	42	22	70	And they all said, "Are You the Son of God, then?" And He said to them, "Yes, I am."
Luke	Luke	42	22	71	Then they said, "What further need do we have of testimony? For we have heard it ourselves from His own mouth."
Luke	Luke	42	23	1	Then the whole body of them got up and brought Him before Pilate.
Luke	Luke	42	23	2	And they began to accuse Him, saying, "We found this man misleading our nation and forbidding to pay taxes to Caesar, and saying that He Himself is Christ, a King."
Luke	Luke	42	23	3	So Pilate asked Him, saying, "Are You the King of the Jews?" And He answered him and said, "It is as you say."
Luke	Luke	42	23	4	Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, "I find no guilt in this man."
Luke	Luke	42	23	5	But they kept on insisting, saying, "He stirs up the people, teaching all over Judea, starting from Galilee even as far as this place."
Luke	Luke	42	23	6	When Pilate heard it, he asked whether the man was a Galilean.
Luke	Luke	42	23	7	And when he learned that He belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who himself also was in Jerusalem at that time.
Luke	Luke	42	23	8	Now Herod was very glad when he saw Jesus; for he had wanted to see Him for a long time, because he had been hearing about Him and was hoping to see some sign performed by Him.
Luke	Luke	42	23	9	And he questioned Him at some length; but He answered him nothing.
Luke	Luke	42	23	10	And the chief priests and the scribes were standing there, accusing Him vehemently.
Luke	Luke	42	23	11	And Herod with his soldiers, after treating Him with contempt and mocking Him, dressed Him in a gorgeous robe and sent Him back to Pilate.
Luke	Luke	42	23	12	Now Herod and Pilate became friends with one another that very day; for before they had been enemies with each other.
Luke	Luke	42	23	13	Pilate summoned the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
Luke	Luke	42	23	14	and said to them, "You brought this man to me as one who incites the people to rebellion, and behold, having examined Him before you, I have found no guilt in this man regarding the charges which you make against Him.
Luke	Luke	42	23	15	"No, nor has Herod, for he sent Him back to us; and behold, nothing deserving death has been done by Him.
Luke	Luke	42	23	16	"Therefore I will punish Him and release Him."
Luke	Luke	42	23	17	[Now he was obliged to release to them at the feast one prisoner.]
Luke	Luke	42	23	18	But they cried out all together, saying, "Away with this man, and release for us Barabbas!"
Luke	Luke	42	23	19	(He was one who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection made in the city, and for murder.)
Luke	Luke	42	23	20	Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, addressed them again,
Luke	Luke	42	23	21	but they kept on calling out, saying, "Crucify, crucify Him!"
Luke	Luke	42	23	22	And he said to them the third time, "Why, what evil has this man done? I have found in Him no guilt demanding death; therefore I will punish Him and release Him."
Luke	Luke	42	23	23	But they were insistent, with loud voices asking that He be crucified. And their voices began to prevail.
Luke	Luke	42	23	24	And Pilate pronounced sentence that their demand be granted.
Luke	Luke	42	23	25	And he released the man they were asking for who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, but he delivered Jesus to their will.
Luke	Luke	42	23	26	When they led Him away, they seized a man, Simon of Cyrene, coming in from the country, and placed on him the cross to carry behind Jesus.
Luke	Luke	42	23	27	And following Him was a large crowd of the people, and of women who were mourning and lamenting Him.
Luke	Luke	42	23	28	But Jesus turning to them said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, stop weeping for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.
Luke	Luke	42	23	29	"For behold, the days are coming when they will say, 'Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.'
Luke	Luke	42	23	30	"Then they will begin TO SAY TO THE MOUNTAINS, 'FALL ON US,' AND TO THE HILLS, 'COVER US.'
Luke	Luke	42	23	31	"For if they do these things when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?"
Luke	Luke	42	23	32	Two others also, who were criminals, were being led away to be put to death with Him.
Luke	Luke	42	23	33	When they came to the place called The Skull, there they crucified Him and the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left.
Luke	Luke	42	23	34	But Jesus was saying, "Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing." And they cast lots, dividing up His garments among themselves.
Luke	Luke	42	23	35	And the people stood by, looking on. And even the rulers were sneering at Him, saying, "He saved others; let Him save Himself if this is the Christ of God, His Chosen One."
Luke	Luke	42	23	36	The soldiers also mocked Him, coming up to Him, offering Him sour wine,
Luke	Luke	42	23	37	and saying, "If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself!"
Luke	Luke	42	23	38	Now there was also an inscription above Him, "THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS."
Luke	Luke	42	23	39	One of the criminals who were hanged there was hurling abuse at Him, saying, "Are You not the Christ? Save Yourself and us!"
Luke	Luke	42	23	40	But the other answered, and rebuking him said, "Do you not even fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation?
Luke	Luke	42	23	41	"And we indeed are suffering justly, for we are receiving what we deserve for our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong."
Luke	Luke	42	23	42	And he was saying, "Jesus, remember me when You come in Your kingdom!"
Luke	Luke	42	23	43	And He said to him, "Truly I say to you, today you shall be with Me in Paradise."
Luke	Luke	42	23	44	It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour,
Luke	Luke	42	23	45	because the sun was obscured; and the veil of the temple was torn in two.
Luke	Luke	42	23	46	And Jesus, crying out with a loud voice, said, "Father, INTO YOUR HANDS I COMMIT MY SPIRIT." Having said this, He breathed His last.
Luke	Luke	42	23	47	Now when the centurion saw what had happened, he began praising God, saying, "Certainly this man was innocent."
Luke	Luke	42	23	48	And all the crowds who came together for this spectacle, when they observed what had happened, began to return, beating their breasts.
Luke	Luke	42	23	49	And all His acquaintances and the women who accompanied Him from Galilee were standing at a distance, seeing these things.
Luke	Luke	42	23	50	And a man named Joseph, who was a member of the Council, a good and righteous man
Luke	Luke	42	23	51	(he had not consented to their plan and action), a man from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who was waiting for the kingdom of God;
Luke	Luke	42	23	52	this man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
Luke	Luke	42	23	53	And he took it down and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid Him in a tomb cut into the rock, where no one had ever lain.
Luke	Luke	42	23	54	It was the preparation day, and the Sabbath was about to begin.
Luke	Luke	42	23	55	Now the women who had come with Him out of Galilee followed, and saw the tomb and how His body was laid.
Luke	Luke	42	23	56	Then they returned and prepared spices and perfumes. And on the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.
Luke	Luke	42	24	1	But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared.
Luke	Luke	42	24	2	And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb,
Luke	Luke	42	24	3	but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
Luke	Luke	42	24	4	While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men suddenly stood near them in dazzling clothing;
Luke	Luke	42	24	5	and as the women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, "Why do you seek the living One among the dead?
Luke	Luke	42	24	6	"He is not here, but He has risen. Remember how He spoke to you while He was still in Galilee,
Luke	Luke	42	24	7	saying that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again."
Luke	Luke	42	24	8	And they remembered His words,
Luke	Luke	42	24	9	and returned from the tomb and reported all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.
Luke	Luke	42	24	10	Now they were Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James; also the other women with them were telling these things to the apostles.
Luke	Luke	42	24	11	But these words appeared to them as nonsense, and they would not believe them.
Luke	Luke	42	24	12	But Peter got up and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he *saw the linen wrappings only; and he went away to his home, marveling at what had happened.
Luke	Luke	42	24	13	And behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was about seven miles from Jerusalem.
Luke	Luke	42	24	14	And they were talking with each other about all these things which had taken place.
Luke	Luke	42	24	15	While they were talking and discussing, Jesus Himself approached and began traveling with them.
Luke	Luke	42	24	16	But their eyes were prevented from recognizing Him.
Luke	Luke	42	24	17	And He said to them, "What are these words that you are exchanging with one another as you are walking?" And they stood still, looking sad.
Luke	Luke	42	24	18	One of them, named Cleopas, answered and said to Him, "Are You the only one visiting Jerusalem and unaware of the things which have happened here in these days?"
Luke	Luke	42	24	19	And He said to them, "What things?" And they said to Him, "The things about Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word in the sight of God and all the people,
Luke	Luke	42	24	20	and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to the sentence of death, and crucified Him.
Luke	Luke	42	24	21	"But we were hoping that it was He who was going to redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all this, it is the third day since these things happened.
Luke	Luke	42	24	22	"But also some women among us amazed us. When they were at the tomb early in the morning,
Luke	Luke	42	24	23	and did not find His body, they came, saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said that He was alive.
Luke	Luke	42	24	24	"Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just exactly as the women also had said; but Him they did not see."
Luke	Luke	42	24	25	And He said to them, "O foolish men and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!
Luke	Luke	42	24	26	"Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and to enter into His glory?"
Luke	Luke	42	24	27	Then beginning with Moses and with all the prophets, He explained to them the things concerning Himself in all the Scriptures.
Luke	Luke	42	24	28	And they approached the village where they were going, and He acted as though He were going farther.
Luke	Luke	42	24	29	But they urged Him, saying, "Stay with us, for it is getting toward evening, and the day is now nearly over." So He went in to stay with them.
Luke	Luke	42	24	30	When He had reclined at the table with them, He took the bread and blessed it, and breaking it, He began giving it to them.
Luke	Luke	42	24	31	Then their eyes were opened and they recognized Him; and He vanished from their sight.
Luke	Luke	42	24	32	They said to one another, "Were not our hearts burning within us while He was speaking to us on the road, while He was explaining the Scriptures to us?"
Luke	Luke	42	24	33	And they got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and found gathered together the eleven and those who were with them,
Luke	Luke	42	24	34	saying, "The Lord has really risen and has appeared to Simon."
Luke	Luke	42	24	35	They began to relate their experiences on the road and how He was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread.
Luke	Luke	42	24	36	While they were telling these things, He Himself stood in their midst and *said to them, "Peace be to you."
Luke	Luke	42	24	37	But they were startled and frightened and thought that they were seeing a spirit.
Luke	Luke	42	24	38	And He said to them, "Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts?
Luke	Luke	42	24	39	"See My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself; touch Me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have."
Luke	Luke	42	24	40	And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet.
Luke	Luke	42	24	41	While they still could not believe it because of their joy and amazement, He said to them, "Have you anything here to eat?"
Luke	Luke	42	24	42	They gave Him a piece of a broiled fish;
Luke	Luke	42	24	43	and He took it and ate it before them.
Luke	Luke	42	24	44	Now He said to them, "These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things which are written about Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled."
Luke	Luke	42	24	45	Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,
Luke	Luke	42	24	46	and He said to them, "Thus it is written, that the Christ would suffer and rise again from the dead the third day,
Luke	Luke	42	24	47	and that repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.
Luke	Luke	42	24	48	"You are witnesses of these things.
Luke	Luke	42	24	49	"And behold, I am sending forth the promise of My Father upon you; but you are to stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high."
Luke	Luke	42	24	50	And He led them out as far as Bethany, and He lifted up His hands and blessed them.
Luke	Luke	42	24	51	While He was blessing them, He parted from them and was carried up into heaven.
Luke	Luke	42	24	52	And they, after worshiping Him, returned to Jerusalem with great joy,
Luke	Luke	42	24	53	and were continually in the temple praising God.
John	John	43	1	1	In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
John	John	43	1	2	He was in the beginning with God.
John	John	43	1	3	All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being that has come into being.
John	John	43	1	4	In Him was life, and the life was the Light of men.
John	John	43	1	5	The Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.
John	John	43	1	6	There came a man sent from God, whose name was John.
John	John	43	1	7	He came as a witness, to testify about the Light, so that all might believe through him.
John	John	43	1	8	He was not the Light, but he came to testify about the Light.
John	John	43	1	9	There was the true Light which, coming into the world, enlightens every man.
John	John	43	1	10	He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the world did not know Him.
John	John	43	1	11	He came to His own, and those who were His own did not receive Him.
John	John	43	1	12	But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, even to those who believe in His name,
John	John	43	1	13	who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.
John	John	43	1	14	And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.
John	John	43	1	15	John *testified about Him and cried out, saying, "This was He of whom I said, 'He who comes after me has a higher rank than I, for He existed before me.'"
John	John	43	1	16	For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.
John	John	43	1	17	For the Law was given through Moses; grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ.
John	John	43	1	18	No one has seen God at any time; the only begotten God who is in the bosom of the Father, He has explained Him.
John	John	43	1	19	This is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent to him priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?"
John	John	43	1	20	And he confessed and did not deny, but confessed, "I am not the Christ."
John	John	43	1	21	They asked him, "What then? Are you Elijah?" And he *said, "I am not." "Are you the Prophet?" And he answered, "No."
John	John	43	1	22	Then they said to him, "Who are you, so that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?"
John	John	43	1	23	He said, "I am A VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS, 'MAKE STRAIGHT THE WAY OF THE LORD,' as Isaiah the prophet said."
John	John	43	1	24	Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.
John	John	43	1	25	They asked him, and said to him, "Why then are you baptizing, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?"
John	John	43	1	26	John answered them saying, "I baptize in water, but among you stands One whom you do not know.
John	John	43	1	27	"It is He who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie."
John	John	43	1	28	These things took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
John	John	43	1	29	The next day he *saw Jesus coming to him and *said, "Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!
John	John	43	1	30	"This is He on behalf of whom I said, 'After me comes a Man who has a higher rank than I, for He existed before me.'
John	John	43	1	31	"I did not recognize Him, but so that He might be manifested to Israel, I came baptizing in water."
John	John	43	1	32	John testified saying, "I have seen the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He remained upon Him.
John	John	43	1	33	"I did not recognize Him, but He who sent me to baptize in water said to me, 'He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining upon Him, this is the One who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.'
John	John	43	1	34	"I myself have seen, and have testified that this is the Son of God."
John	John	43	1	35	Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples,
John	John	43	1	36	and he looked at Jesus as He walked, and *said, "Behold, the Lamb of God!"
John	John	43	1	37	The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
John	John	43	1	38	And Jesus turned and saw them following, and *said to them, "What do you seek?" They said to Him, "Rabbi (which translated means Teacher), where are You staying?"
John	John	43	1	39	He *said to them, "Come, and you will see." So they came and saw where He was staying; and they stayed with Him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.
John	John	43	1	40	One of the two who heard John speak and followed Him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.
John	John	43	1	41	He *found first his own brother Simon and *said to him, "We have found the Messiah" (which translated means Christ).
John	John	43	1	42	He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, "You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas" (which is translated Peter).
John	John	43	1	43	The next day He purposed to go into Galilee, and He *found Philip. And Jesus *said to him, "Follow Me."
John	John	43	1	44	Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.
John	John	43	1	45	Philip *found Nathanael and *said to him, "We have found Him of whom Moses in the Law and also the Prophets wrote--Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."
John	John	43	1	46	Nathanael said to him, "Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?" Philip *said to him, "Come and see."
John	John	43	1	47	Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him, and *said of him, "Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit!"
John	John	43	1	48	Nathanael *said to Him, "How do You know me?" Jesus answered and said to him, "Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you."
John	John	43	1	49	Nathanael answered Him, "Rabbi, You are the Son of God; You are the King of Israel."
John	John	43	1	50	Jesus answered and said to him, "Because I said to you that I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You will see greater things than these."
John	John	43	1	51	And He *said to him, "Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see the heavens opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."
John	John	43	2	1	On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there;
John	John	43	2	2	and both Jesus and His disciples were invited to the wedding.
John	John	43	2	3	When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus *said to Him, "They have no wine."
John	John	43	2	4	And Jesus *said to her, "Woman, what does that have to do with us? My hour has not yet come."
John	John	43	2	5	His mother *said to the servants, "Whatever He says to you, do it."
John	John	43	2	6	Now there were six stone waterpots set there for the Jewish custom of purification, containing twenty or thirty gallons each.
John	John	43	2	7	Jesus *said to them, "Fill the waterpots with water." So they filled them up to the brim.
John	John	43	2	8	And He *said to them, "Draw some out now and take it to the headwaiter." So they took it to him.
John	John	43	2	9	When the headwaiter tasted the water which had become wine, and did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the headwaiter *called the bridegroom,
John	John	43	2	10	and *said to him, "Every man serves the good wine first, and when the people have drunk freely, then he serves the poorer wine; but you have kept the good wine until now."
John	John	43	2	11	This beginning of His signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and manifested His glory, and His disciples believed in Him.
John	John	43	2	12	After this He went down to Capernaum, He and His mother and His brothers and His disciples; and they stayed there a few days.
John	John	43	2	13	The Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
John	John	43	2	14	And He found in the temple those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the money changers seated at their tables.
John	John	43	2	15	And He made a scourge of cords, and drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and the oxen; and He poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables;
John	John	43	2	16	and to those who were selling the doves He said, "Take these things away; stop making My Father's house a place of business."
John	John	43	2	17	His disciples remembered that it was written, "ZEAL FOR YOUR HOUSE WILL CONSUME ME."
John	John	43	2	18	The Jews then said to Him, "What sign do You show us as your authority for doing these things?"
John	John	43	2	19	Jesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."
John	John	43	2	20	The Jews then said, "It took forty-six years to build this temple, and will You raise it up in three days?"
John	John	43	2	21	But He was speaking of the temple of His body.
John	John	43	2	22	So when He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He said this; and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.
John	John	43	2	23	Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in His name, observing His signs which He was doing.
John	John	43	2	24	But Jesus, on His part, was not entrusting Himself to them, for He knew all men,
John	John	43	2	25	and because He did not need anyone to testify concerning man, for He Himself knew what was in man.
John	John	43	3	1	Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews;
John	John	43	3	2	this man came to Jesus by night and said to Him, "Rabbi, we know that You have come from God as a teacher; for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him."
John	John	43	3	3	Jesus answered and said to him, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God."
John	John	43	3	4	Nicodemus *said to Him, "How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born, can he?"
John	John	43	3	5	Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
John	John	43	3	6	"That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
John	John	43	3	7	"Do not be amazed that I said to you, 'You must be born again.'
John	John	43	3	8	"The wind blows where it wishes and you hear the sound of it, but do not know where it comes from and where it is going; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit."
John	John	43	3	9	Nicodemus said to Him, "How can these things be?"
John	John	43	3	10	Jesus answered and said to him, "Are you the teacher of Israel and do not understand these things?
John	John	43	3	11	"Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know and testify of what we have seen, and you do not accept our testimony.
John	John	43	3	12	"If I told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?
John	John	43	3	13	"No one has ascended into heaven, but He who descended from heaven: the Son of Man.
John	John	43	3	14	"As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up;
John	John	43	3	15	so that whoever believes will in Him have eternal life.
John	John	43	3	16	"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.
John	John	43	3	17	"For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.
John	John	43	3	18	"He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
John	John	43	3	19	"This is the judgment, that the Light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil.
John	John	43	3	20	"For everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come to the Light for fear that his deeds will be exposed.
John	John	43	3	21	"But he who practices the truth comes to the Light, so that his deeds may be manifested as having been wrought in God."
John	John	43	3	22	After these things Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea, and there He was spending time with them and baptizing.
John	John	43	3	23	John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there; and people were coming and were being baptized--
John	John	43	3	24	for John had not yet been thrown into prison.
John	John	43	3	25	Therefore there arose a discussion on the part of John's disciples with a Jew about purification.
John	John	43	3	26	And they came to John and said to him, "Rabbi, He who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified, behold, He is baptizing and all are coming to Him."
John	John	43	3	27	John answered and said, "A man can receive nothing unless it has been given him from heaven.
John	John	43	3	28	"You yourselves are my witnesses that I said, 'I am not the Christ,' but, 'I have been sent ahead of Him.'
John	John	43	3	29	"He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice. So this joy of mine has been made full.
John	John	43	3	30	"He must increase, but I must decrease.
John	John	43	3	31	"He who comes from above is above all, he who is of the earth is from the earth and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all.
John	John	43	3	32	"What He has seen and heard, of that He testifies; and no one receives His testimony.
John	John	43	3	33	"He who has received His testimony has set his seal to this, that God is true.
John	John	43	3	34	"For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for He gives the Spirit without measure.
John	John	43	3	35	"The Father loves the Son and has given all things into His hand.
John	John	43	3	36	"He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him."
John	John	43	4	1	Therefore when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John
John	John	43	4	2	(although Jesus Himself was not baptizing, but His disciples were),
John	John	43	4	3	He left Judea and went away again into Galilee.
John	John	43	4	4	And He had to pass through Samaria.
John	John	43	4	5	So He *came to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph;
John	John	43	4	6	and Jacob's well was there. So Jesus, being wearied from His journey, was sitting thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.
John	John	43	4	7	There *came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus *said to her, "Give Me a drink."
John	John	43	4	8	For His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.
John	John	43	4	9	Therefore the Samaritan woman *said to Him, "How is it that You, being a Jew, ask me for a drink since I am a Samaritan woman?" (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)
John	John	43	4	10	Jesus answered and said to her, "If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, 'Give Me a drink,' you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water."
John	John	43	4	11	She *said to Him, "Sir, You have nothing to draw with and the well is deep; where then do You get that living water?
John	John	43	4	12	"You are not greater than our father Jacob, are You, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself and his sons and his cattle?"
John	John	43	4	13	Jesus answered and said to her, "Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again;
John	John	43	4	14	but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall never thirst; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life."
John	John	43	4	15	The woman *said to Him, "Sir, give me this water, so I will not be thirsty nor come all the way here to draw."
John	John	43	4	16	He *said to her, "Go, call your husband and come here."
John	John	43	4	17	The woman answered and said, "I have no husband." Jesus *said to her, "You have correctly said, 'I have no husband';
John	John	43	4	18	for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you now have is not your husband; this you have said truly."
John	John	43	4	19	The woman *said to Him, "Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet.
John	John	43	4	20	"Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you people say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship."
John	John	43	4	21	Jesus *said to her, "Woman, believe Me, an hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.
John	John	43	4	22	"You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.
John	John	43	4	23	"But an hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for such people the Father seeks to be His worshipers.
John	John	43	4	24	"God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth."
John	John	43	4	25	The woman *said to Him, "I know that Messiah is coming (He who is called Christ); when that One comes, He will declare all things to us."
John	John	43	4	26	Jesus *said to her, "I who speak to you am He."
John	John	43	4	27	At this point His disciples came, and they were amazed that He had been speaking with a woman, yet no one said, "What do You seek?" or, "Why do You speak with her?"
John	John	43	4	28	So the woman left her waterpot, and went into the city and *said to the men,
John	John	43	4	29	"Come, see a man who told me all the things that I have done; this is not the Christ, is it?"
John	John	43	4	30	They went out of the city, and were coming to Him.
John	John	43	4	31	Meanwhile the disciples were urging Him, saying, "Rabbi, eat."
John	John	43	4	32	But He said to them, "I have food to eat that you do not know about."
John	John	43	4	33	So the disciples were saying to one another, "No one brought Him anything to eat, did he?"
John	John	43	4	34	Jesus *said to them, "My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to accomplish His work.
John	John	43	4	35	"Do you not say, 'There are yet four months, and then comes the harvest'? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and look on the fields, that they are white for harvest.
John	John	43	4	36	"Already he who reaps is receiving wages and is gathering fruit for life eternal; so that he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.
John	John	43	4	37	"For in this case the saying is true, 'One sows and another reaps.'
John	John	43	4	38	"I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored and you have entered into their labor."
John	John	43	4	39	From that city many of the Samaritans believed in Him because of the word of the woman who testified, "He told me all the things that I have done."
John	John	43	4	40	So when the Samaritans came to Jesus, they were asking Him to stay with them; and He stayed there two days.
John	John	43	4	41	Many more believed because of His word;
John	John	43	4	42	and they were saying to the woman, "It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves and know that this One is indeed the Savior of the world."
John	John	43	4	43	After the two days He went forth from there into Galilee.
John	John	43	4	44	For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
John	John	43	4	45	So when He came to Galilee, the Galileans received Him, having seen all the things that He did in Jerusalem at the feast; for they themselves also went to the feast.
John	John	43	4	46	Therefore He came again to Cana of Galilee where He had made the water wine. And there was a royal official whose son was sick at Capernaum.
John	John	43	4	47	When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and was imploring Him to come down and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.
John	John	43	4	48	So Jesus said to him, "Unless you people see signs and wonders, you simply will not believe."
John	John	43	4	49	The royal official *said to Him, "Sir, come down before my child dies."
John	John	43	4	50	Jesus *said to him, "Go; your son lives." The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and started off.
John	John	43	4	51	As he was now going down, his slaves met him, saying that his son was living.
John	John	43	4	52	So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. Then they said to him, "Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him."
John	John	43	4	53	So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him, "Your son lives"; and he himself believed and his whole household.
John	John	43	4	54	This is again a second sign that Jesus performed when He had come out of Judea into Galilee.
John	John	43	5	1	After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
John	John	43	5	2	Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep gate a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porticoes.
John	John	43	5	3	In these lay a multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, and withered, [waiting for the moving of the waters;
John	John	43	5	4	for an angel of the Lord went down at certain seasons into the pool and stirred up the water; whoever then first, after the stirring up of the water, stepped in was made well from whatever disease with which he was afflicted.]
John	John	43	5	5	A man was there who had been ill for thirty-eight years.
John	John	43	5	6	When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had already been a long time in that condition, He *said to him, "Do you wish to get well?"
John	John	43	5	7	The sick man answered Him, "Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I am coming, another steps down before me."
John	John	43	5	8	Jesus *said to him, "Get up, pick up your pallet and walk."
John	John	43	5	9	Immediately the man became well, and picked up his pallet and began to walk. Now it was the Sabbath on that day.
John	John	43	5	10	So the Jews were saying to the man who was cured, "It is the Sabbath, and it is not permissible for you to carry your pallet."
John	John	43	5	11	But he answered them, "He who made me well was the one who said to me, 'Pick up your pallet and walk.'"
John	John	43	5	12	They asked him, "Who is the man who said to you, 'Pick up your pallet and walk'?"
John	John	43	5	13	But the man who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away while there was a crowd in that place.
John	John	43	5	14	Afterward Jesus *found him in the temple and said to him, "Behold, you have become well; do not sin anymore, so that nothing worse happens to you."
John	John	43	5	15	The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.
John	John	43	5	16	For this reason the Jews were persecuting Jesus, because He was doing these things on the Sabbath.
John	John	43	5	17	But He answered them, "My Father is working until now, and I Myself am working."
John	John	43	5	18	For this reason therefore the Jews were seeking all the more to kill Him, because He not only was breaking the Sabbath, but also was calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.
John	John	43	5	19	Therefore Jesus answered and was saying to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, unless it is something He sees the Father doing; for whatever the Father does, these things the Son also does in like manner.
John	John	43	5	20	"For the Father loves the Son, and shows Him all things that He Himself is doing; and the Father will show Him greater works than these, so that you will marvel.
John	John	43	5	21	"For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom He wishes.
John	John	43	5	22	"For not even the Father judges anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son,
John	John	43	5	23	so that all will honor the Son even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.
John	John	43	5	24	"Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word, and believes Him who sent Me, has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.
John	John	43	5	25	"Truly, truly, I say to you, an hour is coming and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.
John	John	43	5	26	"For just as the Father has life in Himself, even so He gave to the Son also to have life in Himself;
John	John	43	5	27	and He gave Him authority to execute judgment, because He is the Son of Man.
John	John	43	5	28	"Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,
John	John	43	5	29	and will come forth; those who did the good deeds to a resurrection of life, those who committed the evil deeds to a resurrection of judgment.
John	John	43	5	30	"I can do nothing on My own initiative. As I hear, I judge; and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.
John	John	43	5	31	"If I alone testify about Myself, My testimony is not true.
John	John	43	5	32	"There is another who testifies of Me, and I know that the testimony which He gives about Me is true.
John	John	43	5	33	"You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.
John	John	43	5	34	"But the testimony which I receive is not from man, but I say these things so that you may be saved.
John	John	43	5	35	"He was the lamp that was burning and was shining and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.
John	John	43	5	36	"But the testimony which I have is greater than the testimony of John; for the works which the Father has given Me to accomplish--the very works that I do--testify about Me, that the Father has sent Me.
John	John	43	5	37	"And the Father who sent Me, He has testified of Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time nor seen His form.
John	John	43	5	38	"You do not have His word abiding in you, for you do not believe Him whom He sent.
John	John	43	5	39	"You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; it is these that testify about Me;
John	John	43	5	40	and you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life.
John	John	43	5	41	"I do not receive glory from men;
John	John	43	5	42	but I know you, that you do not have the love of God in yourselves.
John	John	43	5	43	"I have come in My Father's name, and you do not receive Me; if another comes in his own name, you will receive him.
John	John	43	5	44	"How can you believe, when you receive glory from one another and you do not seek the glory that is from the one and only God?
John	John	43	5	45	"Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father; the one who accuses you is Moses, in whom you have set your hope.
John	John	43	5	46	"For if you believed Moses, you would believe Me, for he wrote about Me.
John	John	43	5	47	"But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?"
John	John	43	6	1	After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee (or Tiberias).
John	John	43	6	2	A large crowd followed Him, because they saw the signs which He was performing on those who were sick.
John	John	43	6	3	Then Jesus went up on the mountain, and there He sat down with His disciples.
John	John	43	6	4	Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.
John	John	43	6	5	Therefore Jesus, lifting up His eyes and seeing that a large crowd was coming to Him, *said to Philip, "Where are we to buy bread, so that these may eat?"
John	John	43	6	6	This He was saying to test him, for He Himself knew what He was intending to do.
John	John	43	6	7	Philip answered Him, "Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, for everyone to receive a little."
John	John	43	6	8	One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, *said to Him,
John	John	43	6	9	"There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are these for so many people?"
John	John	43	6	10	Jesus said, "Have the people sit down." Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.
John	John	43	6	11	Jesus then took the loaves, and having given thanks, He distributed to those who were seated; likewise also of the fish as much as they wanted.
John	John	43	6	12	When they were filled, He *said to His disciples, "Gather up the leftover fragments so that nothing will be lost."
John	John	43	6	13	So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves which were left over by those who had eaten.
John	John	43	6	14	Therefore when the people saw the sign which He had performed, they said, "This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world."
John	John	43	6	15	So Jesus, perceiving that they were intending to come and take Him by force to make Him king, withdrew again to the mountain by Himself alone.
John	John	43	6	16	Now when evening came, His disciples went down to the sea,
John	John	43	6	17	and after getting into a boat, they started to cross the sea to Capernaum. It had already become dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.
John	John	43	6	18	The sea began to be stirred up because a strong wind was blowing.
John	John	43	6	19	Then, when they had rowed about three or four miles, they *saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near to the boat; and they were frightened.
John	John	43	6	20	But He *said to them, "It is I; do not be afraid."
John	John	43	6	21	So they were willing to receive Him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going.
John	John	43	6	22	The next day the crowd that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other small boat there, except one, and that Jesus had not entered with His disciples into the boat, but that His disciples had gone away alone.
John	John	43	6	23	There came other small boats from Tiberias near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
John	John	43	6	24	So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they themselves got into the small boats, and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus.
John	John	43	6	25	When they found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, "Rabbi, when did You get here?"
John	John	43	6	26	Jesus answered them and said, "Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek Me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were filled.
John	John	43	6	27	"Do not work for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you, for on Him the Father, God, has set His seal."
John	John	43	6	28	Therefore they said to Him, "What shall we do, so that we may work the works of God?"
John	John	43	6	29	Jesus answered and said to them, "This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He has sent."
John	John	43	6	30	So they said to Him, "What then do You do for a sign, so that we may see, and believe You? What work do You perform?
John	John	43	6	31	"Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, 'HE GAVE THEM BREAD OUT OF HEAVEN TO EAT.'"
John	John	43	6	32	Jesus then said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, it is not Moses who has given you the bread out of heaven, but it is My Father who gives you the true bread out of heaven.
John	John	43	6	33	"For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven, and gives life to the world."
John	John	43	6	34	Then they said to Him, "Lord, always give us this bread."
John	John	43	6	35	Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me will not hunger, and he who believes in Me will never thirst.
John	John	43	6	36	"But I said to you that you have seen Me, and yet do not believe.
John	John	43	6	37	"All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will certainly not cast out.
John	John	43	6	38	"For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.
John	John	43	6	39	"This is the will of Him who sent Me, that of all that He has given Me I lose nothing, but raise it up on the last day.
John	John	43	6	40	"For this is the will of My Father, that everyone who beholds the Son and believes in Him will have eternal life, and I Myself will raise him up on the last day."
John	John	43	6	41	Therefore the Jews were grumbling about Him, because He said, "I am the bread that came down out of heaven."
John	John	43	6	42	They were saying, "Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does He now say, 'I have come down out of heaven'?"
John	John	43	6	43	Jesus answered and said to them, "Do not grumble among yourselves.
John	John	43	6	44	"No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up on the last day.
John	John	43	6	45	"It is written in the prophets, 'AND THEY SHALL ALL BE TAUGHT OF GOD.' Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father, comes to Me.
John	John	43	6	46	"Not that anyone has seen the Father, except the One who is from God; He has seen the Father.
John	John	43	6	47	"Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has eternal life.
John	John	43	6	48	"I am the bread of life.
John	John	43	6	49	"Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.
John	John	43	6	50	"This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, so that one may eat of it and not die.
John	John	43	6	51	"I am the living bread that came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever; and the bread also which I will give for the life of the world is My flesh."
John	John	43	6	52	Then the Jews began to argue with one another, saying, "How can this man give us His flesh to eat?"
John	John	43	6	53	So Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in yourselves.
John	John	43	6	54	"He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.
John	John	43	6	55	"For My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink.
John	John	43	6	56	"He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me, and I in him.
John	John	43	6	57	"As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also will live because of Me.
John	John	43	6	58	"This is the bread which came down out of heaven; not as the fathers ate and died; he who eats this bread will live forever."
John	John	43	6	59	These things He said in the synagogue as He taught in Capernaum.
John	John	43	6	60	Therefore many of His disciples, when they heard this said, "This is a difficult statement; who can listen to it?"
John	John	43	6	61	But Jesus, conscious that His disciples grumbled at this, said to them, "Does this cause you to stumble?
John	John	43	6	62	"What then if you see the Son of Man ascending to where He was before?
John	John	43	6	63	"It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.
John	John	43	6	64	"But there are some of you who do not believe." For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who it was that would betray Him.
John	John	43	6	65	And He was saying, "For this reason I have said to you, that no one can come to Me unless it has been granted him from the Father."
John	John	43	6	66	As a result of this many of His disciples withdrew and were not walking with Him anymore.
John	John	43	6	67	So Jesus said to the twelve, "You do not want to go away also, do you?"
John	John	43	6	68	Simon Peter answered Him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have words of eternal life.
John	John	43	6	69	"We have believed and have come to know that You are the Holy One of God."
John	John	43	6	70	Jesus answered them, "Did I Myself not choose you, the twelve, and yet one of you is a devil?"
John	John	43	6	71	Now He meant Judas the son of Simon Iscariot, for he, one of the twelve, was going to betray Him.
John	John	43	7	1	After these things Jesus was walking in Galilee, for He was unwilling to walk in Judea because the Jews were seeking to kill Him.
John	John	43	7	2	Now the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was near.
John	John	43	7	3	Therefore His brothers said to Him, "Leave here and go into Judea, so that Your disciples also may see Your works which You are doing.
John	John	43	7	4	"For no one does anything in secret when he himself seeks to be known publicly. If You do these things, show Yourself to the world."
John	John	43	7	5	For not even His brothers were believing in Him.
John	John	43	7	6	So Jesus *said to them, "My time is not yet here, but your time is always opportune.
John	John	43	7	7	"The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me because I testify of it, that its deeds are evil.
John	John	43	7	8	"Go up to the feast yourselves; I do not go up to this feast because My time has not yet fully come."
John	John	43	7	9	Having said these things to them, He stayed in Galilee.
John	John	43	7	10	But when His brothers had gone up to the feast, then He Himself also went up, not publicly, but as if, in secret.
John	John	43	7	11	So the Jews were seeking Him at the feast and were saying, "Where is He?"
John	John	43	7	12	There was much grumbling among the crowds concerning Him; some were saying, "He is a good man"; others were saying, "No, on the contrary, He leads the people astray."
John	John	43	7	13	Yet no one was speaking openly of Him for fear of the Jews.
John	John	43	7	14	But when it was now the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and began to teach.
John	John	43	7	15	The Jews then were astonished, saying, "How has this man become learned, having never been educated?"
John	John	43	7	16	So Jesus answered them and said, "My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me.
John	John	43	7	17	"If anyone is willing to do His will, he will know of the teaching, whether it is of God or whether I speak from Myself.
John	John	43	7	18	"He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but He who is seeking the glory of the One who sent Him, He is true, and there is no unrighteousness in Him.
John	John	43	7	19	"Did not Moses give you the Law, and yet none of you carries out the Law? Why do you seek to kill Me?"
John	John	43	7	20	The crowd answered, "You have a demon! Who seeks to kill You?"
John	John	43	7	21	Jesus answered them, "I did one deed, and you all marvel.
John	John	43	7	22	"For this reason Moses has given you circumcision (not because it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a man.
John	John	43	7	23	"If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath so that the Law of Moses will not be broken, are you angry with Me because I made an entire man well on the Sabbath?
John	John	43	7	24	"Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with righteous judgment."
John	John	43	7	25	So some of the people of Jerusalem were saying, "Is this not the man whom they are seeking to kill?
John	John	43	7	26	"Look, He is speaking publicly, and they are saying nothing to Him. The rulers do not really know that this is the Christ, do they?
John	John	43	7	27	"However, we know where this man is from; but whenever the Christ may come, no one knows where He is from."
John	John	43	7	28	Then Jesus cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, "You both know Me and know where I am from; and I have not come of Myself, but He who sent Me is true, whom you do not know.
John	John	43	7	29	"I know Him, because I am from Him, and He sent Me."
John	John	43	7	30	So they were seeking to seize Him; and no man laid his hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come.
John	John	43	7	31	But many of the crowd believed in Him; and they were saying, "When the Christ comes, He will not perform more signs than those which this man has, will He?"
John	John	43	7	32	The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things about Him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to seize Him.
John	John	43	7	33	Therefore Jesus said, "For a little while longer I am with you, then I go to Him who sent Me.
John	John	43	7	34	"You will seek Me, and will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come."
John	John	43	7	35	The Jews then said to one another, "Where does this man intend to go that we will not find Him? He is not intending to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks, is He?
John	John	43	7	36	"What is this statement that He said, 'You will seek Me, and will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come'?"
John	John	43	7	37	Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, "If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink.
John	John	43	7	38	"He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, 'From his innermost being will flow rivers of living water.'"
John	John	43	7	39	But this He spoke of the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were to receive; for the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.
John	John	43	7	40	Some of the people therefore, when they heard these words, were saying, "This certainly is the Prophet."
John	John	43	7	41	Others were saying, "This is the Christ." Still others were saying, "Surely the Christ is not going to come from Galilee, is He?
John	John	43	7	42	"Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes from the descendants of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?"
John	John	43	7	43	So a division occurred in the crowd because of Him.
John	John	43	7	44	Some of them wanted to seize Him, but no one laid hands on Him.
John	John	43	7	45	The officers then came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, "Why did you not bring Him?"
John	John	43	7	46	The officers answered, "Never has a man spoken the way this man speaks."
John	John	43	7	47	The Pharisees then answered them, "You have not also been led astray, have you?
John	John	43	7	48	"No one of the rulers or Pharisees has believed in Him, has he?
John	John	43	7	49	"But this crowd which does not know the Law is accursed."
John	John	43	7	50	Nicodemus (he who came to Him before, being one of them) *said to them,
John	John	43	7	51	"Our Law does not judge a man unless it first hears from him and knows what he is doing, does it?"
John	John	43	7	52	They answered him, "You are not also from Galilee, are you? Search, and see that no prophet arises out of Galilee."
John	John	43	7	53	[Everyone went to his home.
John	John	43	8	1	But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
John	John	43	8	2	Early in the morning He came again into the temple, and all the people were coming to Him; and He sat down and began to teach them.
John	John	43	8	3	The scribes and the Pharisees *brought a woman caught in adultery, and having set her in the center of the court,
John	John	43	8	4	they *said to Him, "Teacher, this woman has been caught in adultery, in the very act.
John	John	43	8	5	"Now in the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women; what then do You say?"
John	John	43	8	6	They were saying this, testing Him, so that they might have grounds for accusing Him. But Jesus stooped down and with His finger wrote on the ground.
John	John	43	8	7	But when they persisted in asking Him, He straightened up, and said to them, "He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her."
John	John	43	8	8	Again He stooped down and wrote on the ground.
John	John	43	8	9	When they heard it, they began to go out one by one, beginning with the older ones, and He was left alone, and the woman, where she was, in the center of the court.
John	John	43	8	10	Straightening up, Jesus said to her, "Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn you?"
John	John	43	8	11	She said, "No one, Lord." And Jesus said, "I do not condemn you, either. Go. From now on sin no more."]
John	John	43	8	12	Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, "I am the Light of the world; he who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light of life."
John	John	43	8	13	So the Pharisees said to Him, "You are testifying about Yourself; Your testimony is not true."
John	John	43	8	14	Jesus answered and said to them, "Even if I testify about Myself, My testimony is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from or where I am going.
John	John	43	8	15	"You judge according to the flesh; I am not judging anyone.
John	John	43	8	16	"But even if I do judge, My judgment is true; for I am not alone in it, but I and the Father who sent Me.
John	John	43	8	17	"Even in your law it has been written that the testimony of two men is true.
John	John	43	8	18	"I am He who testifies about Myself, and the Father who sent Me testifies about Me."
John	John	43	8	19	So they were saying to Him, "Where is Your Father?" Jesus answered, "You know neither Me nor My Father; if you knew Me, you would know My Father also."
John	John	43	8	20	These words He spoke in the treasury, as He taught in the temple; and no one seized Him, because His hour had not yet come.
John	John	43	8	21	Then He said again to them, "I go away, and you will seek Me, and will die in your sin; where I am going, you cannot come."
John	John	43	8	22	So the Jews were saying, "Surely He will not kill Himself, will He, since He says, 'Where I am going, you cannot come'?"
John	John	43	8	23	And He was saying to them, "You are from below, I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world.
John	John	43	8	24	"Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am He, you will die in your sins."
John	John	43	8	25	So they were saying to Him, "Who are You?" Jesus said to them, "What have I been saying to you from the beginning?
John	John	43	8	26	"I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you, but He who sent Me is true; and the things which I heard from Him, these I speak to the world."
John	John	43	8	27	They did not realize that He had been speaking to them about the Father.
John	John	43	8	28	So Jesus said, "When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am He, and I do nothing on My own initiative, but I speak these things as the Father taught Me.
John	John	43	8	29	"And He who sent Me is with Me; He has not left Me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to Him."
John	John	43	8	30	As He spoke these things, many came to believe in Him.
John	John	43	8	31	So Jesus was saying to those Jews who had believed Him, "If you continue in My word, then you are truly disciples of Mine;
John	John	43	8	32	and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free."
John	John	43	8	33	They answered Him, "We are Abraham's descendants and have never yet been enslaved to anyone; how is it that You say, 'You will become free'?"
John	John	43	8	34	Jesus answered them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is the slave of sin.
John	John	43	8	35	"The slave does not remain in the house forever; the son does remain forever.
John	John	43	8	36	"So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.
John	John	43	8	37	"I know that you are Abraham's descendants; yet you seek to kill Me, because My word has no place in you.
John	John	43	8	38	"I speak the things which I have seen with My Father; therefore you also do the things which you heard from your father."
John	John	43	8	39	They answered and said to Him, "Abraham is our father." Jesus *said to them, "If you are Abraham's children, do the deeds of Abraham.
John	John	43	8	40	"But as it is, you are seeking to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth, which I heard from God; this Abraham did not do.
John	John	43	8	41	"You are doing the deeds of your father." They said to Him, "We were not born of fornication; we have one Father: God."
John	John	43	8	42	Jesus said to them, "If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I proceeded forth and have come from God, for I have not even come on My own initiative, but He sent Me.
John	John	43	8	43	"Why do you not understand what I am saying? It is because you cannot hear My word.
John	John	43	8	44	"You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. Whenever he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.
John	John	43	8	45	"But because I speak the truth, you do not believe Me.
John	John	43	8	46	"Which one of you convicts Me of sin? If I speak truth, why do you not believe Me?
John	John	43	8	47	"He who is of God hears the words of God; for this reason you do not hear them, because you are not of God."
John	John	43	8	48	The Jews answered and said to Him, "Do we not say rightly that You are a Samaritan and have a demon?"
John	John	43	8	49	Jesus answered, "I do not have a demon; but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me.
John	John	43	8	50	"But I do not seek My glory; there is One who seeks and judges.
John	John	43	8	51	"Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps My word he will never see death."
John	John	43	8	52	The Jews said to Him, "Now we know that You have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets also; and You say, 'If anyone keeps My word, he will never taste of death.'
John	John	43	8	53	"Surely You are not greater than our father Abraham, who died? The prophets died too; whom do You make Yourself out to be?"
John	John	43	8	54	Jesus answered, "If I glorify Myself, My glory is nothing; it is My Father who glorifies Me, of whom you say, 'He is our God';
John	John	43	8	55	and you have not come to know Him, but I know Him; and if I say that I do not know Him, I will be a liar like you, but I do know Him and keep His word.
John	John	43	8	56	"Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it and was glad."
John	John	43	8	57	So the Jews said to Him, "You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?"
John	John	43	8	58	Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was born, I am."
John	John	43	8	59	Therefore they picked up stones to throw at Him, but Jesus hid Himself and went out of the temple.
John	John	43	9	1	As He passed by, He saw a man blind from birth.
John	John	43	9	2	And His disciples asked Him, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he would be born blind?"
John	John	43	9	3	Jesus answered, "It was neither that this man sinned, nor his parents; but it was so that the works of God might be displayed in him.
John	John	43	9	4	"We must work the works of Him who sent Me as long as it is day; night is coming when no one can work.
John	John	43	9	5	"While I am in the world, I am the Light of the world."
John	John	43	9	6	When He had said this, He spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and applied the clay to his eyes,
John	John	43	9	7	and said to him, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam" (which is translated, Sent). So he went away and washed, and came back seeing.
John	John	43	9	8	Therefore the neighbors, and those who previously saw him as a beggar, were saying, "Is not this the one who used to sit and beg?"
John	John	43	9	9	Others were saying, "This is he," still others were saying, "No, but he is like him." He kept saying, "I am the one."
John	John	43	9	10	So they were saying to him, "How then were your eyes opened?"
John	John	43	9	11	He answered, "The man who is called Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me, 'Go to Siloam and wash'; so I went away and washed, and I received sight."
John	John	43	9	12	They said to him, "Where is He?" He *said, "I do not know."
John	John	43	9	13	They *brought to the Pharisees the man who was formerly blind.
John	John	43	9	14	Now it was a Sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.
John	John	43	9	15	Then the Pharisees also were asking him again how he received his sight. And he said to them, "He applied clay to my eyes, and I washed, and I see."
John	John	43	9	16	Therefore some of the Pharisees were saying, "This man is not from God, because He does not keep the Sabbath." But others were saying, "How can a man who is a sinner perform such signs?" And there was a division among them.
John	John	43	9	17	So they *said to the blind man again, "What do you say about Him, since He opened your eyes?" And he said, "He is a prophet."
John	John	43	9	18	The Jews then did not believe it of him, that he had been blind and had received sight, until they called the parents of the very one who had received his sight,
John	John	43	9	19	and questioned them, saying, "Is this your son, who you say was born blind? Then how does he now see?"
John	John	43	9	20	His parents answered them and said, "We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;
John	John	43	9	21	but how he now sees, we do not know; or who opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him; he is of age, he will speak for himself."
John	John	43	9	22	His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone confessed Him to be Christ, he was to be put out of the synagogue.
John	John	43	9	23	For this reason his parents said, "He is of age; ask him."
John	John	43	9	24	So a second time they called the man who had been blind, and said to him, "Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner."
John	John	43	9	25	He then answered, "Whether He is a sinner, I do not know; one thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see."
John	John	43	9	26	So they said to him, "What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?"
John	John	43	9	27	He answered them, "I told you already and you did not listen; why do you want to hear it again? You do not want to become His disciples too, do you?"
John	John	43	9	28	They reviled him and said, "You are His disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.
John	John	43	9	29	"We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where He is from."
John	John	43	9	30	The man answered and said to them, "Well, here is an amazing thing, that you do not know where He is from, and yet He opened my eyes.
John	John	43	9	31	"We know that God does not hear sinners; but if anyone is God-fearing and does His will, He hears him.
John	John	43	9	32	"Since the beginning of time it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a person born blind.
John	John	43	9	33	"If this man were not from God, He could do nothing."
John	John	43	9	34	They answered him, "You were born entirely in sins, and are you teaching us?" So they put him out.
John	John	43	9	35	Jesus heard that they had put him out, and finding him, He said, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?"
John	John	43	9	36	He answered, "Who is He, Lord, that I may believe in Him?"
John	John	43	9	37	Jesus said to him, "You have both seen Him, and He is the one who is talking with you."
John	John	43	9	38	And he said, "Lord, I believe." And he worshiped Him.
John	John	43	9	39	And Jesus said, "For judgment I came into this world, so that those who do not see may see, and that those who see may become blind."
John	John	43	9	40	Those of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these things and said to Him, "We are not blind too, are we?"
John	John	43	9	41	Jesus said to them, "If you were blind, you would have no sin; but since you say, 'We see,' your sin remains.
John	John	43	10	1	"Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter by the door into the fold of the sheep, but climbs up some other way, he is a thief and a robber.
John	John	43	10	2	"But he who enters by the door is a shepherd of the sheep.
John	John	43	10	3	"To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.
John	John	43	10	4	"When he puts forth all his own, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.
John	John	43	10	5	"A stranger they simply will not follow, but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers."
John	John	43	10	6	This figure of speech Jesus spoke to them, but they did not understand what those things were which He had been saying to them.
John	John	43	10	7	So Jesus said to them again, "Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.
John	John	43	10	8	"All who came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them.
John	John	43	10	9	"I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture.
John	John	43	10	10	"The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I came that they may have life, and have it abundantly.
John	John	43	10	11	"I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.
John	John	43	10	12	"He who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd, who is not the owner of the sheep, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and scatters them.
John	John	43	10	13	"He flees because he is a hired hand and is not concerned about the sheep.
John	John	43	10	14	"I am the good shepherd, and I know My own and My own know Me,
John	John	43	10	15	even as the Father knows Me and I know the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep.
John	John	43	10	16	"I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they will hear My voice; and they will become one flock with one shepherd.
John	John	43	10	17	"For this reason the Father loves Me, because I lay down My life so that I may take it again.
John	John	43	10	18	"No one has taken it away from Me, but I lay it down on My own initiative. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. This commandment I received from My Father."
John	John	43	10	19	A division occurred again among the Jews because of these words.
John	John	43	10	20	Many of them were saying, "He has a demon and is insane. Why do you listen to Him?"
John	John	43	10	21	Others were saying, "These are not the sayings of one demon-possessed. A demon cannot open the eyes of the blind, can he?"
John	John	43	10	22	At that time the Feast of the Dedication took place at Jerusalem;
John	John	43	10	23	it was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple in the portico of Solomon.
John	John	43	10	24	The Jews then gathered around Him, and were saying to Him, "How long will You keep us in suspense? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly."
John	John	43	10	25	Jesus answered them, "I told you, and you do not believe; the works that I do in My Father's name, these testify of Me.
John	John	43	10	26	"But you do not believe because you are not of My sheep.
John	John	43	10	27	"My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me;
John	John	43	10	28	and I give eternal life to them, and they will never perish; and no one will snatch them out of My hand.
John	John	43	10	29	"My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand.
John	John	43	10	30	"I and the Father are one."
John	John	43	10	31	The Jews picked up stones again to stone Him.
John	John	43	10	32	Jesus answered them, "I showed you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you stoning Me?"
John	John	43	10	33	The Jews answered Him, "For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy; and because You, being a man, make Yourself out to be God."
John	John	43	10	34	Jesus answered them, "Has it not been written in your Law, 'I SAID, YOU ARE GODS'?
John	John	43	10	35	"If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture cannot be broken),
John	John	43	10	36	do you say of Him, whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, 'You are blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God'?
John	John	43	10	37	"If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me;
John	John	43	10	38	but if I do them, though you do not believe Me, believe the works, so that you may know and understand that the Father is in Me, and I in the Father."
John	John	43	10	39	Therefore they were seeking again to seize Him, and He eluded their grasp.
John	John	43	10	40	And He went away again beyond the Jordan to the place where John was first baptizing, and He was staying there.
John	John	43	10	41	Many came to Him and were saying, "While John performed no sign, yet everything John said about this man was true."
John	John	43	10	42	Many believed in Him there.
John	John	43	11	1	Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
John	John	43	11	2	It was the Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.
John	John	43	11	3	So the sisters sent word to Him, saying, "Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick."
John	John	43	11	4	But when Jesus heard this, He said, "This sickness is not to end in death, but for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified by it."
John	John	43	11	5	Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
John	John	43	11	6	So when He heard that he was sick, He then stayed two days longer in the place where He was.
John	John	43	11	7	Then after this He *said to the disciples, "Let us go to Judea again."
John	John	43	11	8	The disciples *said to Him, "Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone You, and are You going there again?"
John	John	43	11	9	Jesus answered, "Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.
John	John	43	11	10	"But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him."
John	John	43	11	11	This He said, and after that He *said to them, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I go, so that I may awaken him out of sleep."
John	John	43	11	12	The disciples then said to Him, "Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover."
John	John	43	11	13	Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that He was speaking of literal sleep.
John	John	43	11	14	So Jesus then said to them plainly, "Lazarus is dead,
John	John	43	11	15	and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe; but let us go to him."
John	John	43	11	16	Therefore Thomas, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, "Let us also go, so that we may die with Him."
John	John	43	11	17	So when Jesus came, He found that he had already been in the tomb four days.
John	John	43	11	18	Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles off;
John	John	43	11	19	and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother.
John	John	43	11	20	Martha therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet Him, but Mary stayed at the house.
John	John	43	11	21	Martha then said to Jesus, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.
John	John	43	11	22	"Even now I know that whatever You ask of God, God will give You."
John	John	43	11	23	Jesus *said to her, "Your brother will rise again."
John	John	43	11	24	Martha *said to Him, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day."
John	John	43	11	25	Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me will live even if he dies,
John	John	43	11	26	and everyone who lives and believes in Me will never die. Do you believe this?"
John	John	43	11	27	She *said to Him, "Yes, Lord; I have believed that You are the Christ, the Son of God, even He who comes into the world."
John	John	43	11	28	When she had said this, she went away and called Mary her sister, saying secretly, "The Teacher is here and is calling for you."
John	John	43	11	29	And when she heard it, she *got up quickly and was coming to Him.
John	John	43	11	30	Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met Him.
John	John	43	11	31	Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and consoling her, when they saw that Mary got up quickly and went out, they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there.
John	John	43	11	32	Therefore, when Mary came where Jesus was, she saw Him, and fell at His feet, saying to Him, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died."
John	John	43	11	33	When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her also weeping, He was deeply moved in spirit and was troubled,
John	John	43	11	34	and said, "Where have you laid him?" They *said to Him, "Lord, come and see."
John	John	43	11	35	Jesus wept.
John	John	43	11	36	So the Jews were saying, "See how He loved him!"
John	John	43	11	37	But some of them said, "Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind man, have kept this man also from dying?"
John	John	43	11	38	So Jesus, again being deeply moved within, *came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone was lying against it.
John	John	43	11	39	Jesus *said, "Remove the stone." Martha, the sister of the deceased, *said to Him, "Lord, by this time there will be a stench, for he has been dead four days."
John	John	43	11	40	Jesus *said to her, "Did I not say to you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God?"
John	John	43	11	41	So they removed the stone. Then Jesus raised His eyes, and said, "Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.
John	John	43	11	42	"I knew that You always hear Me; but because of the people standing around I said it, so that they may believe that You sent Me."
John	John	43	11	43	When He had said these things, He cried out with a loud voice, "Lazarus, come forth."
John	John	43	11	44	The man who had died came forth, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around with a cloth. Jesus *said to them, "Unbind him, and let him go."
John	John	43	11	45	Therefore many of the Jews who came to Mary, and saw what He had done, believed in Him.
John	John	43	11	46	But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them the things which Jesus had done.
John	John	43	11	47	Therefore the chief priests and the Pharisees convened a council, and were saying, "What are we doing? For this man is performing many signs.
John	John	43	11	48	"If we let Him go on like this, all men will believe in Him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation."
John	John	43	11	49	But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, "You know nothing at all,
John	John	43	11	50	nor do you take into account that it is expedient for you that one man die for the people, and that the whole nation not perish."
John	John	43	11	51	Now he did not say this on his own initiative, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation,
John	John	43	11	52	and not for the nation only, but in order that He might also gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.
John	John	43	11	53	So from that day on they planned together to kill Him.
John	John	43	11	54	Therefore Jesus no longer continued to walk publicly among the Jews, but went away from there to the country near the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim; and there He stayed with the disciples.
John	John	43	11	55	Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the Passover to purify themselves.
John	John	43	11	56	So they were seeking for Jesus, and were saying to one another as they stood in the temple, "What do you think; that He will not come to the feast at all?"
John	John	43	11	57	Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where He was, he was to report it, so that they might seize Him.
John	John	43	12	1	Jesus, therefore, six days before the Passover, came to Bethany where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.
John	John	43	12	2	So they made Him a supper there, and Martha was serving; but Lazarus was one of those reclining at the table with Him.
John	John	43	12	3	Mary then took a pound of very costly perfume of pure nard, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped His feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.
John	John	43	12	4	But Judas Iscariot, one of His disciples, who was intending to betray Him, *said,
John	John	43	12	5	"Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and given to poor people?"
John	John	43	12	6	Now he said this, not because he was concerned about the poor, but because he was a thief, and as he had the money box, he used to pilfer what was put into it.
John	John	43	12	7	Therefore Jesus said, "Let her alone, so that she may keep it for the day of My burial.
John	John	43	12	8	"For you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have Me."
John	John	43	12	9	The large crowd of the Jews then learned that He was there; and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might also see Lazarus, whom He raised from the dead.
John	John	43	12	10	But the chief priests planned to put Lazarus to death also;
John	John	43	12	11	because on account of him many of the Jews were going away and were believing in Jesus.
John	John	43	12	12	On the next day the large crowd who had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
John	John	43	12	13	took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet Him, and began to shout, "Hosanna! BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD, even the King of Israel."
John	John	43	12	14	Jesus, finding a young donkey, sat on it; as it is written,
John	John	43	12	15	"FEAR NOT, DAUGHTER OF ZION; BEHOLD, YOUR KING IS COMING, SEATED ON A DONKEY'S COLT."
John	John	43	12	16	These things His disciples did not understand at the first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of Him, and that they had done these things to Him.
John	John	43	12	17	So the people, who were with Him when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead, continued to testify about Him.
John	John	43	12	18	For this reason also the people went and met Him, because they heard that He had performed this sign.
John	John	43	12	19	So the Pharisees said to one another, "You see that you are not doing any good; look, the world has gone after Him."
John	John	43	12	20	Now there were some Greeks among those who were going up to worship at the feast;
John	John	43	12	21	these then came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and began to ask him, saying, "Sir, we wish to see Jesus."
John	John	43	12	22	Philip *came and *told Andrew; Andrew and Philip *came and *told Jesus.
John	John	43	12	23	And Jesus *answered them, saying, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.
John	John	43	12	24	"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.
John	John	43	12	25	"He who loves his life loses it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it to life eternal.
John	John	43	12	26	"If anyone serves Me, he must follow Me; and where I am, there My servant will be also; if anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him.
John	John	43	12	27	"Now My soul has become troubled; and what shall I say, 'Father, save Me from this hour'? But for this purpose I came to this hour.
John	John	43	12	28	"Father, glorify Your name." Then a voice came out of heaven: "I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again."
John	John	43	12	29	So the crowd of people who stood by and heard it were saying that it had thundered; others were saying, "An angel has spoken to Him."
John	John	43	12	30	Jesus answered and said, "This voice has not come for My sake, but for your sakes.
John	John	43	12	31	"Now judgment is upon this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out.
John	John	43	12	32	"And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to Myself."
John	John	43	12	33	But He was saying this to indicate the kind of death by which He was to die.
John	John	43	12	34	The crowd then answered Him, "We have heard out of the Law that the Christ is to remain forever; and how can You say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this Son of Man?"
John	John	43	12	35	So Jesus said to them, "For a little while longer the Light is among you. Walk while you have the Light, so that darkness will not overtake you; he who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes.
John	John	43	12	36	"While you have the Light, believe in the Light, so that you may become sons of Light." These things Jesus spoke, and He went away and hid Himself from them.
John	John	43	12	37	But though He had performed so many signs before them, yet they were not believing in Him.
John	John	43	12	38	This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet which he spoke: "LORD, WHO HAS BELIEVED OUR REPORT? AND TO WHOM HAS THE ARM OF THE LORD BEEN REVEALED?"
John	John	43	12	39	For this reason they could not believe, for Isaiah said again,
John	John	43	12	40	"HE HAS BLINDED THEIR EYES AND HE HARDENED THEIR HEART, SO THAT THEY WOULD NOT SEE WITH THEIR EYES AND PERCEIVE WITH THEIR HEART, AND BE CONVERTED AND I HEAL THEM."
John	John	43	12	41	These things Isaiah said because he saw His glory, and he spoke of Him.
John	John	43	12	42	Nevertheless many even of the rulers believed in Him, but because of the Pharisees they were not confessing Him, for fear that they would be put out of the synagogue;
John	John	43	12	43	for they loved the approval of men rather than the approval of God.
John	John	43	12	44	And Jesus cried out and said, "He who believes in Me, does not believe in Me but in Him who sent Me.
John	John	43	12	45	"He who sees Me sees the One who sent Me.
John	John	43	12	46	"I have come as Light into the world, so that everyone who believes in Me will not remain in darkness.
John	John	43	12	47	"If anyone hears My sayings and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world.
John	John	43	12	48	"He who rejects Me and does not receive My sayings, has one who judges him; the word I spoke is what will judge him at the last day.
John	John	43	12	49	"For I did not speak on My own initiative, but the Father Himself who sent Me has given Me a commandment as to what to say and what to speak.
John	John	43	12	50	"I know that His commandment is eternal life; therefore the things I speak, I speak just as the Father has told Me."
John	John	43	13	1	Now before the Feast of the Passover, Jesus knowing that His hour had come that He would depart out of this world to the Father, having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the end.
John	John	43	13	2	During supper, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray Him,
John	John	43	13	3	Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He had come forth from God and was going back to God,
John	John	43	13	4	*got up from supper, and *laid aside His garments; and taking a towel, He girded Himself.
John	John	43	13	5	Then He *poured water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded.
John	John	43	13	6	So He *came to Simon Peter. He *said to Him, "Lord, do You wash my feet?"
John	John	43	13	7	Jesus answered and said to him, "What I do you do not realize now, but you will understand hereafter."
John	John	43	13	8	Peter *said to Him, "Never shall You wash my feet!" Jesus answered him, "If I do not wash you, you have no part with Me."
John	John	43	13	9	Simon Peter *said to Him, "Lord, then wash not only my feet, but also my hands and my head."
John	John	43	13	10	Jesus *said to him, "He who has bathed needs only to wash his feet, but is completely clean; and you are clean, but not all of you."
John	John	43	13	11	For He knew the one who was betraying Him; for this reason He said, "Not all of you are clean."
John	John	43	13	12	So when He had washed their feet, and taken His garments and reclined at the table again, He said to them, "Do you know what I have done to you?
John	John	43	13	13	"You call Me Teacher and Lord; and you are right, for so I am.
John	John	43	13	14	"If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet.
John	John	43	13	15	"For I gave you an example that you also should do as I did to you.
John	John	43	13	16	"Truly, truly, I say to you, a slave is not greater than his master, nor is one who is sent greater than the one who sent him.
John	John	43	13	17	"If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.
John	John	43	13	18	"I do not speak of all of you. I know the ones I have chosen; but it is that the Scripture may be fulfilled, 'HE WHO EATS MY BREAD HAS LIFTED UP HIS HEEL AGAINST ME.'
John	John	43	13	19	"From now on I am telling you before it comes to pass, so that when it does occur, you may believe that I am He.
John	John	43	13	20	"Truly, truly, I say to you, he who receives whomever I send receives Me; and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me."
John	John	43	13	21	When Jesus had said this, He became troubled in spirit, and testified and said, "Truly, truly, I say to you, that one of you will betray Me."
John	John	43	13	22	The disciples began looking at one another, at a loss to know of which one He was speaking.
John	John	43	13	23	There was reclining on Jesus' bosom one of His disciples, whom Jesus loved.
John	John	43	13	24	So Simon Peter *gestured to him, and *said to him, "Tell us who it is of whom He is speaking."
John	John	43	13	25	He, leaning back thus on Jesus' bosom, *said to Him, "Lord, who is it?"
John	John	43	13	26	Jesus then *answered, "That is the one for whom I shall dip the morsel and give it to him." So when He had dipped the morsel, He *took and *gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.
John	John	43	13	27	After the morsel, Satan then entered into him. Therefore Jesus *said to him, "What you do, do quickly."
John	John	43	13	28	Now no one of those reclining at the table knew for what purpose He had said this to him.
John	John	43	13	29	For some were supposing, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus was saying to him, "Buy the things we have need of for the feast"; or else, that he should give something to the poor.
John	John	43	13	30	So after receiving the morsel he went out immediately; and it was night.
John	John	43	13	31	Therefore when he had gone out, Jesus *said, "Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in Him;
John	John	43	13	32	if God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and will glorify Him immediately.
John	John	43	13	33	"Little children, I am with you a little while longer. You will seek Me; and as I said to the Jews, now I also say to you, 'Where I am going, you cannot come.'
John	John	43	13	34	"A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another.
John	John	43	13	35	"By this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another."
John	John	43	13	36	Simon Peter *said to Him, "Lord, where are You going?" Jesus answered, "Where I go, you cannot follow Me now; but you will follow later."
John	John	43	13	37	Peter *said to Him, "Lord, why can I not follow You right now? I will lay down my life for You."
John	John	43	13	38	Jesus *answered, "Will you lay down your life for Me? Truly, truly, I say to you, a rooster will not crow until you deny Me three times.
John	John	43	14	1	"Do not let your heart be troubled; believe in God, believe also in Me.
John	John	43	14	2	"In My Father's house are many dwelling places; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.
John	John	43	14	3	"If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself, that where I am, there you may be also.
John	John	43	14	4	"And you know the way where I am going."
John	John	43	14	5	Thomas *said to Him, "Lord, we do not know where You are going, how do we know the way?"
John	John	43	14	6	Jesus *said to him, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father but through Me.
John	John	43	14	7	"If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; from now on you know Him, and have seen Him."
John	John	43	14	8	Philip *said to Him, "Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us."
John	John	43	14	9	Jesus *said to him, "Have I been so long with you, and yet you have not come to know Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how can you say, 'Show us the Father'?
John	John	43	14	10	"Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on My own initiative, but the Father abiding in Me does His works.
John	John	43	14	11	"Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me; otherwise believe because of the works themselves.
John	John	43	14	12	"Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do, he will do also; and greater works than these he will do; because I go to the Father.
John	John	43	14	13	"Whatever you ask in My name, that will I do, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
John	John	43	14	14	"If you ask Me anything in My name, I will do it.
John	John	43	14	15	"If you love Me, you will keep My commandments.
John	John	43	14	16	"I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may be with you forever;
John	John	43	14	17	that is the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see Him or know Him, but you know Him because He abides with you and will be in you.
John	John	43	14	18	"I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.
John	John	43	14	19	"After a little while the world will no longer see Me, but you will see Me; because I live, you will live also.
John	John	43	14	20	"In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.
John	John	43	14	21	"He who has My commandments and keeps them is the one who loves Me; and he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will disclose Myself to him."
John	John	43	14	22	Judas (not Iscariot) *said to Him, "Lord, what then has happened that You are going to disclose Yourself to us and not to the world?"
John	John	43	14	23	Jesus answered and said to him, "If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our abode with him.
John	John	43	14	24	"He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father's who sent Me.
John	John	43	14	25	"These things I have spoken to you while abiding with you.
John	John	43	14	26	"But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I said to you.
John	John	43	14	27	"Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Do not let your heart be troubled, nor let it be fearful.
John	John	43	14	28	"You heard that I said to you, 'I go away, and I will come to you.' If you loved Me, you would have rejoiced because I go to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.
John	John	43	14	29	"Now I have told you before it happens, so that when it happens, you may believe.
John	John	43	14	30	"I will not speak much more with you, for the ruler of the world is coming, and he has nothing in Me;
John	John	43	14	31	but so that the world may know that I love the Father, I do exactly as the Father commanded Me. Get up, let us go from here.
John	John	43	15	1	"I am the true vine, and My Father is the vinedresser.
John	John	43	15	2	"Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes away; and every branch that bears fruit, He prunes it so that it may bear more fruit.
John	John	43	15	3	"You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.
John	John	43	15	4	"Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me.
John	John	43	15	5	"I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing.
John	John	43	15	6	"If anyone does not abide in Me, he is thrown away as a branch and dries up; and they gather them, and cast them into the fire and they are burned.
John	John	43	15	7	"If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.
John	John	43	15	8	"My Father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit, and so prove to be My disciples.
John	John	43	15	9	"Just as the Father has loved Me, I have also loved you; abide in My love.
John	John	43	15	10	"If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love; just as I have kept My Father's commandments and abide in His love.
John	John	43	15	11	"These things I have spoken to you so that My joy may be in you, and that your joy may be made full.
John	John	43	15	12	"This is My commandment, that you love one another, just as I have loved you.
John	John	43	15	13	"Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his friends.
John	John	43	15	14	"You are My friends if you do what I command you.
John	John	43	15	15	"No longer do I call you slaves, for the slave does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard from My Father I have made known to you.
John	John	43	15	16	"You did not choose Me but I chose you, and appointed you that you would go and bear fruit, and that your fruit would remain, so that whatever you ask of the Father in My name He may give to you.
John	John	43	15	17	"This I command you, that you love one another.
John	John	43	15	18	"If the world hates you, you know that it has hated Me before it hated you.
John	John	43	15	19	"If you were of the world, the world would love its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, because of this the world hates you.
John	John	43	15	20	"Remember the word that I said to you, 'A slave is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted Me, they will also persecute you; if they kept My word, they will keep yours also.
John	John	43	15	21	"But all these things they will do to you for My name's sake, because they do not know the One who sent Me.
John	John	43	15	22	"If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin.
John	John	43	15	23	"He who hates Me hates My Father also.
John	John	43	15	24	"If I had not done among them the works which no one else did, they would not have sin; but now they have both seen and hated Me and My Father as well.
John	John	43	15	25	"But they have done this to fulfill the word that is written in their Law, 'THEY HATED ME WITHOUT A CAUSE.'
John	John	43	15	26	"When the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, that is the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, He will testify about Me,
John	John	43	15	27	and you will testify also, because you have been with Me from the beginning.
John	John	43	16	1	"These things I have spoken to you so that you may be kept from stumbling.
John	John	43	16	2	"They will make you outcasts from the synagogue, but an hour is coming for everyone who kills you to think that he is offering service to God.
John	John	43	16	3	"These things they will do because they have not known the Father or Me.
John	John	43	16	4	"But these things I have spoken to you, so that when their hour comes, you may remember that I told you of them. These things I did not say to you at the beginning, because I was with you.
John	John	43	16	5	"But now I am going to Him who sent Me; and none of you asks Me, 'Where are You going?'
John	John	43	16	6	"But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.
John	John	43	16	7	"But I tell you the truth, it is to your advantage that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you.
John	John	43	16	8	"And He, when He comes, will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment;
John	John	43	16	9	concerning sin, because they do not believe in Me;
John	John	43	16	10	and concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father and you no longer see Me;
John	John	43	16	11	and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.
John	John	43	16	12	"I have many more things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.
John	John	43	16	13	"But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own initiative, but whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come.
John	John	43	16	14	"He will glorify Me, for He will take of Mine and will disclose it to you.
John	John	43	16	15	"All things that the Father has are Mine; therefore I said that He takes of Mine and will disclose it to you.
John	John	43	16	16	"A little while, and you will no longer see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me."
John	John	43	16	17	Some of His disciples then said to one another, "What is this thing He is telling us, 'A little while, and you will not see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me'; and, 'because I go to the Father'?"
John	John	43	16	18	So they were saying, "What is this that He says, 'A little while'? We do not know what He is talking about."
John	John	43	16	19	Jesus knew that they wished to question Him, and He said to them, "Are you deliberating together about this, that I said, 'A little while, and you will not see Me, and again a little while, and you will see Me'?
John	John	43	16	20	"Truly, truly, I say to you, that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; you will grieve, but your grief will be turned into joy.
John	John	43	16	21	"Whenever a woman is in labor she has pain, because her hour has come; but when she gives birth to the child, she no longer remembers the anguish because of the joy that a child has been born into the world.
John	John	43	16	22	"Therefore you too have grief now; but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you.
John	John	43	16	23	"In that day you will not question Me about anything. Truly, truly, I say to you, if you ask the Father for anything in My name, He will give it to you.
John	John	43	16	24	"Until now you have asked for nothing in My name; ask and you will receive, so that your joy may be made full.
John	John	43	16	25	"These things I have spoken to you in figurative language; an hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figurative language, but will tell you plainly of the Father.
John	John	43	16	26	"In that day you will ask in My name, and I do not say to you that I will request of the Father on your behalf;
John	John	43	16	27	for the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me and have believed that I came forth from the Father.
John	John	43	16	28	"I came forth from the Father and have come into the world; I am leaving the world again and going to the Father."
John	John	43	16	29	His disciples *said, "Lo, now You are speaking plainly and are not using a figure of speech.
John	John	43	16	30	"Now we know that You know all things, and have no need for anyone to question You; by this we believe that You came from God."
John	John	43	16	31	Jesus answered them, "Do you now believe?
John	John	43	16	32	"Behold, an hour is coming, and has already come, for you to be scattered, each to his own home, and to leave Me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me.
John	John	43	16	33	"These things I have spoken to you, so that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have tribulation, but take courage; I have overcome the world."
John	John	43	17	1	Jesus spoke these things; and lifting up His eyes to heaven, He said, "Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son, that the Son may glorify You,
John	John	43	17	2	even as You gave Him authority over all flesh, that to all whom You have given Him, He may give eternal life.
John	John	43	17	3	"This is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.
John	John	43	17	4	"I glorified You on the earth, having accomplished the work which You have given Me to do.
John	John	43	17	5	"Now, Father, glorify Me together with Yourself, with the glory which I had with You before the world was.
John	John	43	17	6	"I have manifested Your name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world; they were Yours and You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word.
John	John	43	17	7	"Now they have come to know that everything You have given Me is from You;
John	John	43	17	8	for the words which You gave Me I have given to them; and they received them and truly understood that I came forth from You, and they believed that You sent Me.
John	John	43	17	9	"I ask on their behalf; I do not ask on behalf of the world, but of those whom You have given Me; for they are Yours;
John	John	43	17	10	and all things that are Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine; and I have been glorified in them.
John	John	43	17	11	"I am no longer in the world; and yet they themselves are in the world, and I come to You. Holy Father, keep them in Your name, the name which You have given Me, that they may be one even as We are.
John	John	43	17	12	"While I was with them, I was keeping them in Your name which You have given Me; and I guarded them and not one of them perished but the son of perdition, so that the Scripture would be fulfilled.
John	John	43	17	13	"But now I come to You; and these things I speak in the world so that they may have My joy made full in themselves.
John	John	43	17	14	"I have given them Your word; and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
John	John	43	17	15	"I do not ask You to take them out of the world, but to keep them from the evil one.
John	John	43	17	16	"They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
John	John	43	17	17	"Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.
John	John	43	17	18	"As You sent Me into the world, I also have sent them into the world.
John	John	43	17	19	"For their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.
John	John	43	17	20	"I do not ask on behalf of these alone, but for those also who believe in Me through their word;
John	John	43	17	21	that they may all be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us, so that the world may believe that You sent Me.
John	John	43	17	22	"The glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, just as We are one;
John	John	43	17	23	I in them and You in Me, that they may be perfected in unity, so that the world may know that You sent Me, and loved them, even as You have loved Me.
John	John	43	17	24	"Father, I desire that they also, whom You have given Me, be with Me where I am, so that they may see My glory which You have given Me, for You loved Me before the foundation of the world.
John	John	43	17	25	"O righteous Father, although the world has not known You, yet I have known You; and these have known that You sent Me;
John	John	43	17	26	and I have made Your name known to them, and will make it known, so that the love with which You loved Me may be in them, and I in them."
John	John	43	18	1	When Jesus had spoken these words, He went forth with His disciples over the ravine of the Kidron, where there was a garden, in which He entered with His disciples.
John	John	43	18	2	Now Judas also, who was betraying Him, knew the place, for Jesus had often met there with His disciples.
John	John	43	18	3	Judas then, having received the Roman cohort and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, *came there with lanterns and torches and weapons.
John	John	43	18	4	So Jesus, knowing all the things that were coming upon Him, went forth and *said to them, "Whom do you seek?"
John	John	43	18	5	They answered Him, "Jesus the Nazarene." He *said to them, "I am He." And Judas also, who was betraying Him, was standing with them.
John	John	43	18	6	So when He said to them, "I am He," they drew back and fell to the ground.
John	John	43	18	7	Therefore He again asked them, "Whom do you seek?" And they said, "Jesus the Nazarene."
John	John	43	18	8	Jesus answered, "I told you that I am He; so if you seek Me, let these go their way,"
John	John	43	18	9	to fulfill the word which He spoke, "Of those whom You have given Me I lost not one."
John	John	43	18	10	Simon Peter then, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's slave, and cut off his right ear; and the slave's name was Malchus.
John	John	43	18	11	So Jesus said to Peter, "Put the sword into the sheath; the cup which the Father has given Me, shall I not drink it?"
John	John	43	18	12	So the Roman cohort and the commander and the officers of the Jews, arrested Jesus and bound Him,
John	John	43	18	13	and led Him to Annas first; for he was father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.
John	John	43	18	14	Now Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it was expedient for one man to die on behalf of the people.
John	John	43	18	15	Simon Peter was following Jesus, and so was another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and entered with Jesus into the court of the high priest,
John	John	43	18	16	but Peter was standing at the door outside. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the doorkeeper, and brought Peter in.
John	John	43	18	17	Then the slave-girl who kept the door *said to Peter, "You are not also one of this man's disciples, are you?" He *said, "I am not."
John	John	43	18	18	Now the slaves and the officers were standing there, having made a charcoal fire, for it was cold and they were warming themselves; and Peter was also with them, standing and warming himself.
John	John	43	18	19	The high priest then questioned Jesus about His disciples, and about His teaching.
John	John	43	18	20	Jesus answered him, "I have spoken openly to the world; I always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; and I spoke nothing in secret.
John	John	43	18	21	"Why do you question Me? Question those who have heard what I spoke to them; they know what I said."
John	John	43	18	22	When He had said this, one of the officers standing nearby struck Jesus, saying, "Is that the way You answer the high priest?"
John	John	43	18	23	Jesus answered him, "If I have spoken wrongly, testify of the wrong; but if rightly, why do you strike Me?"
John	John	43	18	24	So Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
John	John	43	18	25	Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. So they said to him, "You are not also one of His disciples, are you?" He denied it, and said, "I am not."
John	John	43	18	26	One of the slaves of the high priest, being a relative of the one whose ear Peter cut off, *said, "Did I not see you in the garden with Him?"
John	John	43	18	27	Peter then denied it again, and immediately a rooster crowed.
John	John	43	18	28	Then they *led Jesus from Caiaphas into the Praetorium, and it was early; and they themselves did not enter into the Praetorium so that they would not be defiled, but might eat the Passover.
John	John	43	18	29	Therefore Pilate went out to them and *said, "What accusation do you bring against this Man?"
John	John	43	18	30	They answered and said to him, "If this Man were not an evildoer, we would not have delivered Him to you."
John	John	43	18	31	So Pilate said to them, "Take Him yourselves, and judge Him according to your law." The Jews said to him, "We are not permitted to put anyone to death,"
John	John	43	18	32	to fulfill the word of Jesus which He spoke, signifying by what kind of death He was about to die.
John	John	43	18	33	Therefore Pilate entered again into the Praetorium, and summoned Jesus and said to Him, "Are You the King of the Jews?"
John	John	43	18	34	Jesus answered, "Are you saying this on your own initiative, or did others tell you about Me?"
John	John	43	18	35	Pilate answered, "I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered You to me; what have You done?"
John	John	43	18	36	Jesus answered, "My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, then My servants would be fighting so that I would not be handed over to the Jews; but as it is, My kingdom is not of this realm."
John	John	43	18	37	Therefore Pilate said to Him, "So You are a king?" Jesus answered, "You say correctly that I am a king. For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice."
John	John	43	18	38	Pilate *said to Him, "What is truth?" And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews and *said to them, "I find no guilt in Him.
John	John	43	18	39	"But you have a custom that I release someone for you at the Passover; do you wish then that I release for you the King of the Jews?"
John	John	43	18	40	So they cried out again, saying, "Not this Man, but Barabbas." Now Barabbas was a robber.
John	John	43	19	1	Pilate then took Jesus and scourged Him.
John	John	43	19	2	And the soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on His head, and put a purple robe on Him;
John	John	43	19	3	and they began to come up to Him and say, "Hail, King of the Jews!" and to give Him slaps in the face.
John	John	43	19	4	Pilate came out again and *said to them, "Behold, I am bringing Him out to you so that you may know that I find no guilt in Him."
John	John	43	19	5	Jesus then came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate *said to them, "Behold, the Man!"
John	John	43	19	6	So when the chief priests and the officers saw Him, they cried out saying, "Crucify, crucify!" Pilate *said to them, "Take Him yourselves and crucify Him, for I find no guilt in Him."
John	John	43	19	7	The Jews answered him, "We have a law, and by that law He ought to die because He made Himself out to be the Son of God."
John	John	43	19	8	Therefore when Pilate heard this statement, he was even more afraid;
John	John	43	19	9	and he entered into the Praetorium again and *said to Jesus, "Where are You from?" But Jesus gave him no answer.
John	John	43	19	10	So Pilate *said to Him, "You do not speak to me? Do You not know that I have authority to release You, and I have authority to crucify You?"
John	John	43	19	11	Jesus answered, "You would have no authority over Me, unless it had been given you from above; for this reason he who delivered Me to you has the greater sin."
John	John	43	19	12	As a result of this Pilate made efforts to release Him, but the Jews cried out saying, "If you release this Man, you are no friend of Caesar; everyone who makes himself out to be a king opposes Caesar."
John	John	43	19	13	Therefore when Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.
John	John	43	19	14	Now it was the day of preparation for the Passover; it was about the sixth hour. And he *said to the Jews, "Behold, your King!"
John	John	43	19	15	So they cried out, "Away with Him, away with Him, crucify Him!" Pilate *said to them, "Shall I crucify your King?" The chief priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar."
John	John	43	19	16	So he then handed Him over to them to be crucified.
John	John	43	19	17	They took Jesus, therefore, and He went out, bearing His own cross, to the place called the Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha.
John	John	43	19	18	There they crucified Him, and with Him two other men, one on either side, and Jesus in between.
John	John	43	19	19	Pilate also wrote an inscription and put it on the cross. It was written, "JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS."
John	John	43	19	20	Therefore many of the Jews read this inscription, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Latin and in Greek.
John	John	43	19	21	So the chief priests of the Jews were saying to Pilate, "Do not write, 'The King of the Jews'; but that He said, 'I am King of the Jews.'"
John	John	43	19	22	Pilate answered, "What I have written I have written."
John	John	43	19	23	Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took His outer garments and made four parts, a part to every soldier and also the tunic; now the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece.
John	John	43	19	24	So they said to one another, "Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it, to decide whose it shall be"; this was to fulfill the Scripture: "THEY DIVIDED MY OUTER GARMENTS AMONG THEM, AND FOR MY CLOTHING THEY CAST LOTS."
John	John	43	19	25	Therefore the soldiers did these things. But standing by the cross of Jesus were His mother, and His mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
John	John	43	19	26	When Jesus then saw His mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing nearby, He *said to His mother, "Woman, behold, your son!"
John	John	43	19	27	Then He *said to the disciple, "Behold, your mother!" From that hour the disciple took her into his own household.
John	John	43	19	28	After this, Jesus, knowing that all things had already been accomplished, to fulfill the Scripture, *said, "I am thirsty."
John	John	43	19	29	A jar full of sour wine was standing there; so they put a sponge full of the sour wine upon a branch of hyssop and brought it up to His mouth.
John	John	43	19	30	Therefore when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, "It is finished!" And He bowed His head and gave up His spirit.
John	John	43	19	31	Then the Jews, because it was the day of preparation, so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.
John	John	43	19	32	So the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first man and of the other who was crucified with Him;
John	John	43	19	33	but coming to Jesus, when they saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs.
John	John	43	19	34	But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.
John	John	43	19	35	And he who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true; and he knows that he is telling the truth, so that you also may believe.
John	John	43	19	36	For these things came to pass to fulfill the Scripture, "NOT A BONE OF HIM SHALL BE BROKEN."
John	John	43	19	37	And again another Scripture says, "THEY SHALL LOOK ON HIM WHOM THEY PIERCED."
John	John	43	19	38	After these things Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but a secret one for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate granted permission. So he came and took away His body.
John	John	43	19	39	Nicodemus, who had first come to Him by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds weight.
John	John	43	19	40	So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen wrappings with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews.
John	John	43	19	41	Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid.
John	John	43	19	42	Therefore because of the Jewish day of preparation, since the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.
John	John	43	20	1	Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene *came early to the tomb, while it *was still dark, and *saw the stone already taken away from the tomb.
John	John	43	20	2	So she *ran and *came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and *said to them, "They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him."
John	John	43	20	3	So Peter and the other disciple went forth, and they were going to the tomb.
John	John	43	20	4	The two were running together; and the other disciple ran ahead faster than Peter and came to the tomb first;
John	John	43	20	5	and stooping and looking in, he *saw the linen wrappings lying there; but he did not go in.
John	John	43	20	6	And so Simon Peter also *came, following him, and entered the tomb; and he *saw the linen wrappings lying there,
John	John	43	20	7	and the face-cloth which had been on His head, not lying with the linen wrappings, but rolled up in a place by itself.
John	John	43	20	8	So the other disciple who had first come to the tomb then also entered, and he saw and believed.
John	John	43	20	9	For as yet they did not understand the Scripture, that He must rise again from the dead.
John	John	43	20	10	So the disciples went away again to their own homes.
John	John	43	20	11	But Mary was standing outside the tomb weeping; and so, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb;
John	John	43	20	12	and she *saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been lying.
John	John	43	20	13	And they *said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?" She *said to them, "Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him."
John	John	43	20	14	When she had said this, she turned around and *saw Jesus standing there, and did not know that it was Jesus.
John	John	43	20	15	Jesus *said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?" Supposing Him to be the gardener, she *said to Him, "Sir, if you have carried Him away, tell me where you have laid Him, and I will take Him away."
John	John	43	20	16	Jesus *said to her, "Mary!" She turned and *said to Him in Hebrew, "Rabboni!" (which means, Teacher).
John	John	43	20	17	Jesus *said to her, "Stop clinging to Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brethren and say to them, 'I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God.'"
John	John	43	20	18	Mary Magdalene *came, announcing to the disciples, "I have seen the Lord," and that He had said these things to her.
John	John	43	20	19	So when it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and when the doors were shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in their midst and *said to them, "Peace be with you."
John	John	43	20	20	And when He had said this, He showed them both His hands and His side. The disciples then rejoiced when they saw the Lord.
John	John	43	20	21	So Jesus said to them again, "Peace be with you; as the Father has sent Me, I also send you."
John	John	43	20	22	And when He had said this, He breathed on them and *said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit.
John	John	43	20	23	"If you forgive the sins of any, their sins have been forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they have been retained."
John	John	43	20	24	But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.
John	John	43	20	25	So the other disciples were saying to him, "We have seen the Lord!" But he said to them, "Unless I see in His hands the imprint of the nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails, and put my hand into His side, I will not believe."
John	John	43	20	26	After eight days His disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Jesus *came, the doors having been shut, and stood in their midst and said, "Peace be with you."
John	John	43	20	27	Then He *said to Thomas, "Reach here with your finger, and see My hands; and reach here your hand and put it into My side; and do not be unbelieving, but believing."
John	John	43	20	28	Thomas answered and said to Him, "My Lord and my God!"
John	John	43	20	29	Jesus *said to him, "Because you have seen Me, have you believed? Blessed are they who did not see, and yet believed."
John	John	43	20	30	Therefore many other signs Jesus also performed in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book;
John	John	43	20	31	but these have been written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing you may have life in His name.
John	John	43	21	1	After these things Jesus manifested Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias, and He manifested Himself in this way.
John	John	43	21	2	Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of His disciples were together.
John	John	43	21	3	Simon Peter *said to them, "I am going fishing." They *said to him, "We will also come with you." They went out and got into the boat; and that night they caught nothing.
John	John	43	21	4	But when the day was now breaking, Jesus stood on the beach; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.
John	John	43	21	5	So Jesus *said to them, "Children, you do not have any fish, do you?" They answered Him, "No."
John	John	43	21	6	And He said to them, "Cast the net on the right-hand side of the boat and you will find a catch." So they cast, and then they were not able to haul it in because of the great number of fish.
John	John	43	21	7	Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved *said to Peter, "It is the Lord." So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put his outer garment on (for he was stripped for work), and threw himself into the sea.
John	John	43	21	8	But the other disciples came in the little boat, for they were not far from the land, but about one hundred yards away, dragging the net full of fish.
John	John	43	21	9	So when they got out on the land, they *saw a charcoal fire already laid and fish placed on it, and bread.
John	John	43	21	10	Jesus *said to them, "Bring some of the fish which you have now caught."
John	John	43	21	11	Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land, full of large fish, a hundred and fifty-three; and although there were so many, the net was not torn.
John	John	43	21	12	Jesus *said to them, "Come and have breakfast." None of the disciples ventured to question Him, "Who are You?" knowing that it was the Lord.
John	John	43	21	13	Jesus *came and *took the bread and *gave it to them, and the fish likewise.
John	John	43	21	14	This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to the disciples, after He was raised from the dead.
John	John	43	21	15	So when they had finished breakfast, Jesus *said to Simon Peter, "Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these?" He *said to Him, "Yes, Lord; You know that I love You." He *said to him, "Tend My lambs."
John	John	43	21	16	He *said to him again a second time, "Simon, son of John, do you love Me?" He *said to Him, "Yes, Lord; You know that I love You." He *said to him, "Shepherd My sheep."
John	John	43	21	17	He *said to him the third time, "Simon, son of John, do you love Me?" Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time, "Do you love Me?" And he said to Him, "Lord, You know all things; You know that I love You." Jesus *said to him, "Tend My sheep.
John	John	43	21	18	"Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were younger, you used to gird yourself and walk wherever you wished; but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands and someone else will gird you, and bring you where you do not wish to go."
John	John	43	21	19	Now this He said, signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God. And when He had spoken this, He *said to him, "Follow Me!"
John	John	43	21	20	Peter, turning around, *saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them; the one who also had leaned back on His bosom at the supper and said, "Lord, who is the one who betrays You?"
John	John	43	21	21	So Peter seeing him *said to Jesus, "Lord, and what about this man?"
John	John	43	21	22	Jesus *said to him, "If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow Me!"
John	John	43	21	23	Therefore this saying went out among the brethren that that disciple would not die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but only, "If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you?"
John	John	43	21	24	This is the disciple who is testifying to these things and wrote these things, and we know that his testimony is true.
John	John	43	21	25	And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which if they *were written in detail, I suppose that even the world itself *would not contain the books that *would be written.
Acts		44	1	1	The first account I composed, Theophilus, about all that Jesus began to do and teach,
Acts		44	1	2	until the day when He was taken up to heaven, after He had by the Holy Spirit given orders to the apostles whom He had chosen.
Acts		44	1	3	To these He also presented Himself alive after His suffering, by many convincing proofs, appearing to them over a period of forty days and speaking of the things concerning the kingdom of God.
Acts		44	1	4	Gathering them together, He commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for what the Father had promised, "Which," He said, "you heard of from Me;
Acts		44	1	5	for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now."
Acts		44	1	6	So when they had come together, they were asking Him, saying, "Lord, is it at this time You are restoring the kingdom to Israel?"
Acts		44	1	7	He said to them, "It is not for you to know times or epochs which the Father has fixed by His own authority;
Acts		44	1	8	but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth."
Acts		44	1	9	And after He had said these things, He was lifted up while they were looking on, and a cloud received Him out of their sight.
Acts		44	1	10	And as they were gazing intently into the sky while He was going, behold, two men in white clothing stood beside them.
Acts		44	1	11	They also said, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in just the same way as you have watched Him go into heaven."
Acts		44	1	12	Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away.
Acts		44	1	13	When they had entered the city, they went up to the upper room where they were staying; that is, Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.
Acts		44	1	14	These all with one mind were continually devoting themselves to prayer, along with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers.
Acts		44	1	15	At this time Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren (a gathering of about one hundred and twenty persons was there together), and said,
Acts		44	1	16	"Brethren, the Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit foretold by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus.
Acts		44	1	17	"For he was counted among us and received his share in this ministry."
Acts		44	1	18	(Now this man acquired a field with the price of his wickedness, and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his intestines gushed out.
Acts		44	1	19	And it became known to all who were living in Jerusalem; so that in their own language that field was called Hakeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)
Acts		44	1	20	"For it is written in the book of Psalms, 'LET HIS HOMESTEAD BE MADE DESOLATE, AND LET NO ONE DWELL IN IT'; and, 'LET ANOTHER MAN TAKE HIS OFFICE.'
Acts		44	1	21	"Therefore it is necessary that of the men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us--
Acts		44	1	22	beginning with the baptism of John until the day that He was taken up from us--one of these must become a witness with us of His resurrection."
Acts		44	1	23	So they put forward two men, Joseph called Barsabbas (who was also called Justus), and Matthias.
Acts		44	1	24	And they prayed and said, "You, Lord, who know the hearts of all men, show which one of these two You have chosen
Acts		44	1	25	to occupy this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place."
Acts		44	1	26	And they drew lots for them, and the lot fell to Matthias; and he was added to the eleven apostles.
Acts		44	2	1	When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place.
Acts		44	2	2	And suddenly there came from heaven a noise like a violent rushing wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.
Acts		44	2	3	And there appeared to them tongues as of fire distributing themselves, and they rested on each one of them.
Acts		44	2	4	And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit was giving them utterance.
Acts		44	2	5	Now there were Jews living in Jerusalem, devout men from every nation under heaven.
Acts		44	2	6	And when this sound occurred, the crowd came together, and were bewildered because each one of them was hearing them speak in his own language.
Acts		44	2	7	They were amazed and astonished, saying, "Why, are not all these who are speaking Galileans?
Acts		44	2	8	"And how is it that we each hear them in our own language to which we were born?
Acts		44	2	9	"Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,
Acts		44	2	10	Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the districts of Libya around Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,
Acts		44	2	11	Cretans and Arabs--we hear them in our own tongues speaking of the mighty deeds of God."
Acts		44	2	12	And they all continued in amazement and great perplexity, saying to one another, "What does this mean?"
Acts		44	2	13	But others were mocking and saying, "They are full of sweet wine."
Acts		44	2	14	But Peter, taking his stand with the eleven, raised his voice and declared to them: "Men of Judea and all you who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you and give heed to my words.
Acts		44	2	15	"For these men are not drunk, as you suppose, for it is only the third hour of the day;
Acts		44	2	16	but this is what was spoken of through the prophet Joel:
Acts		44	2	17	'AND IT SHALL BE IN THE LAST DAYS,' God says, 'THAT I WILL POUR FORTH OF MY SPIRIT ON ALL MANKIND; AND YOUR SONS AND YOUR DAUGHTERS SHALL PROPHESY, AND YOUR YOUNG MEN SHALL SEE VISIONS, AND YOUR OLD MEN SHALL DREAM DREAMS;
Acts		44	2	18	EVEN ON MY BONDSLAVES, BOTH MEN AND WOMEN, I WILL IN THOSE DAYS POUR FORTH OF MY SPIRIT And they shall prophesy.
Acts		44	2	19	'AND I WILL GRANT WONDERS IN THE SKY ABOVE AND SIGNS ON THE EARTH BELOW, BLOOD, AND FIRE, AND VAPOR OF SMOKE.
Acts		44	2	20	'THE SUN WILL BE TURNED INTO DARKNESS AND THE MOON INTO BLOOD, BEFORE THE GREAT AND GLORIOUS DAY OF THE LORD SHALL COME.
Acts		44	2	21	'AND IT SHALL BE THAT EVERYONE WHO CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD WILL BE SAVED.'
Acts		44	2	22	"Men of Israel, listen to these words: Jesus the Nazarene, a man attested to you by God with miracles and wonders and signs which God performed through Him in your midst, just as you yourselves know--
Acts		44	2	23	this Man, delivered over by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you nailed to a cross by the hands of godless men and put Him to death.
Acts		44	2	24	"But God raised Him up again, putting an end to the agony of death, since it was impossible for Him to be held in its power.
Acts		44	2	25	"For David says of Him, 'I SAW THE LORD ALWAYS IN MY PRESENCE; FOR HE IS AT MY RIGHT HAND, SO THAT I WILL NOT BE SHAKEN.
Acts		44	2	26	'THEREFORE MY HEART WAS GLAD AND MY TONGUE EXULTED; MOREOVER MY FLESH ALSO WILL LIVE IN HOPE;
Acts		44	2	27	BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT ABANDON MY SOUL TO HADES, NOR ALLOW YOUR HOLY ONE TO UNDERGO DECAY.
Acts		44	2	28	'YOU HAVE MADE KNOWN TO ME THE WAYS OF LIFE; YOU WILL MAKE ME FULL OF GLADNESS WITH YOUR PRESENCE.'
Acts		44	2	29	"Brethren, I may confidently say to you regarding the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.
Acts		44	2	30	"And so, because he was a prophet and knew that GOD HAD SWORN TO HIM WITH AN OATH TO SEAT one OF HIS DESCENDANTS ON HIS THRONE,
Acts		44	2	31	he looked ahead and spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that HE WAS NEITHER ABANDONED TO HADES, NOR DID His flesh SUFFER DECAY.
Acts		44	2	32	"This Jesus God raised up again, to which we are all witnesses.
Acts		44	2	33	"Therefore having been exalted to the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He has poured forth this which you both see and hear.
Acts		44	2	34	"For it was not David who ascended into heaven, but he himself says: 'THE LORD SAID TO MY LORD, "SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND,
Acts		44	2	35	UNTIL I MAKE YOUR ENEMIES A FOOTSTOOL FOR YOUR FEET."'
Acts		44	2	36	"Therefore let all the house of Israel know for certain that God has made Him both Lord and Christ--this Jesus whom you crucified."
Acts		44	2	37	Now when they heard this, they were pierced to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, "Brethren, what shall we do?"
Acts		44	2	38	Peter said to them, "Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
Acts		44	2	39	"For the promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off, as many as the Lord our God will call to Himself."
Acts		44	2	40	And with many other words he solemnly testified and kept on exhorting them, saying, "Be saved from this perverse generation!"
Acts		44	2	41	So then, those who had received his word were baptized; and that day there were added about three thousand souls.
Acts		44	2	42	They were continually devoting themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.
Acts		44	2	43	Everyone kept feeling a sense of awe; and many wonders and signs were taking place through the apostles.
Acts		44	2	44	And all those who had believed were together and had all things in common;
Acts		44	2	45	and they began selling their property and possessions and were sharing them with all, as anyone might have need.
Acts		44	2	46	Day by day continuing with one mind in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they were taking their meals together with gladness and sincerity of heart,
Acts		44	2	47	praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord was adding to their number day by day those who were being saved.
Acts		44	3	1	Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the ninth hour, the hour of prayer.
Acts		44	3	2	And a man who had been lame from his mother's womb was being carried along, whom they used to set down every day at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, in order to beg alms of those who were entering the temple.
Acts		44	3	3	When he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple, he began asking to receive alms.
Acts		44	3	4	But Peter, along with John, fixed his gaze on him and said, "Look at us!"
Acts		44	3	5	And he began to give them his attention, expecting to receive something from them.
Acts		44	3	6	But Peter said, "I do not possess silver and gold, but what I do have I give to you: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene--walk!"
Acts		44	3	7	And seizing him by the right hand, he raised him up; and immediately his feet and his ankles were strengthened.
Acts		44	3	8	With a leap he stood upright and began to walk; and he entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God.
Acts		44	3	9	And all the people saw him walking and praising God;
Acts		44	3	10	and they were taking note of him as being the one who used to sit at the Beautiful Gate of the temple to beg alms, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.
Acts		44	3	11	While he was clinging to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them at the so-called portico of Solomon, full of amazement.
Acts		44	3	12	But when Peter saw this, he replied to the people, "Men of Israel, why are you amazed at this, or why do you gaze at us, as if by our own power or piety we had made him walk?
Acts		44	3	13	"The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified His servant Jesus, the one whom you delivered and disowned in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release Him.
Acts		44	3	14	"But you disowned the Holy and Righteous One and asked for a murderer to be granted to you,
Acts		44	3	15	but put to death the Prince of life, the one whom God raised from the dead, a fact to which we are witnesses.
Acts		44	3	16	"And on the basis of faith in His name, it is the name of Jesus which has strengthened this man whom you see and know; and the faith which comes through Him has given him this perfect health in the presence of you all.
Acts		44	3	17	"And now, brethren, I know that you acted in ignorance, just as your rulers did also.
Acts		44	3	18	"But the things which God announced beforehand by the mouth of all the prophets, that His Christ would suffer, He has thus fulfilled.
Acts		44	3	19	"Therefore repent and return, so that your sins may be wiped away, in order that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord;
Acts		44	3	20	and that He may send Jesus, the Christ appointed for you,
Acts		44	3	21	whom heaven must receive until the period of restoration of all things about which God spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from ancient time.
Acts		44	3	22	"Moses said, 'THE LORD GOD WILL RAISE UP FOR YOU A PROPHET LIKE ME FROM YOUR BRETHREN; TO HIM YOU SHALL GIVE HEED to everything He says to you.
Acts		44	3	23	'And it will be that every soul that does not heed that prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.'
Acts		44	3	24	"And likewise, all the prophets who have spoken, from Samuel and his successors onward, also announced these days.
Acts		44	3	25	"It is you who are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, 'AND IN YOUR SEED ALL THE FAMILIES OF THE EARTH SHALL BE BLESSED.'
Acts		44	3	26	"For you first, God raised up His Servant and sent Him to bless you by turning every one of you from your wicked ways."
Acts		44	4	1	As they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees came up to them,
Acts		44	4	2	being greatly disturbed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
Acts		44	4	3	And they laid hands on them and put them in jail until the next day, for it was already evening.
Acts		44	4	4	But many of those who had heard the message believed; and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.
Acts		44	4	5	On the next day, their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem;
Acts		44	4	6	and Annas the high priest was there, and Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and all who were of high-priestly descent.
Acts		44	4	7	When they had placed them in the center, they began to inquire, "By what power, or in what name, have you done this?"
Acts		44	4	8	Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, "Rulers and elders of the people,
Acts		44	4	9	if we are on trial today for a benefit done to a sick man, as to how this man has been made well,
Acts		44	4	10	let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead--by this name this man stands here before you in good health.
Acts		44	4	11	"He is the STONE WHICH WAS REJECTED by you, THE BUILDERS, but WHICH BECAME THE CHIEF CORNER stone.
Acts		44	4	12	"And there is salvation in no one else; for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be saved."
Acts		44	4	13	Now as they observed the confidence of Peter and John and understood that they were uneducated and untrained men, they were amazed, and began to recognize them as having been with Jesus.
Acts		44	4	14	And seeing the man who had been healed standing with them, they had nothing to say in reply.
Acts		44	4	15	But when they had ordered them to leave the Council, they began to confer with one another,
Acts		44	4	16	saying, "What shall we do with these men? For the fact that a noteworthy miracle has taken place through them is apparent to all who live in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.
Acts		44	4	17	"But so that it will not spread any further among the people, let us warn them to speak no longer to any man in this name."
Acts		44	4	18	And when they had summoned them, they commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.
Acts		44	4	19	But Peter and John answered and said to them, "Whether it is right in the sight of God to give heed to you rather than to God, you be the judge;
Acts		44	4	20	for we cannot stop speaking about what we have seen and heard."
Acts		44	4	21	When they had threatened them further, they let them go (finding no basis on which to punish them) on account of the people, because they were all glorifying God for what had happened;
Acts		44	4	22	for the man was more than forty years old on whom this miracle of healing had been performed.
Acts		44	4	23	When they had been released, they went to their own companions and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.
Acts		44	4	24	And when they heard this, they lifted their voices to God with one accord and said, "O Lord, it is You who MADE THE HEAVEN AND THE EARTH AND THE SEA, AND ALL THAT IS IN THEM,
Acts		44	4	25	who by the Holy Spirit, through the mouth of our father David Your servant, said, 'WHY DID THE GENTILES RAGE, AND THE PEOPLES DEVISE FUTILE THINGS?
Acts		44	4	26	'THE KINGS OF THE EARTH TOOK THEIR STAND, AND THE RULERS WERE GATHERED TOGETHER AGAINST THE LORD AND AGAINST HIS CHRIST.'
Acts		44	4	27	"For truly in this city there were gathered together against Your holy servant Jesus, whom You anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel,
Acts		44	4	28	to do whatever Your hand and Your purpose predestined to occur.
Acts		44	4	29	"And now, Lord, take note of their threats, and grant that Your bond-servants may speak Your word with all confidence,
Acts		44	4	30	while You extend Your hand to heal, and signs and wonders take place through the name of Your holy servant Jesus."
Acts		44	4	31	And when they had prayed, the place where they had gathered together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the word of God with boldness.
Acts		44	4	32	And the congregation of those who believed were of one heart and soul; and not one of them claimed that anything belonging to him was his own, but all things were common property to them.
Acts		44	4	33	And with great power the apostles were giving testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and abundant grace was upon them all.
Acts		44	4	34	For there was not a needy person among them, for all who were owners of land or houses would sell them and bring the proceeds of the sales
Acts		44	4	35	and lay them at the apostles' feet, and they would be distributed to each as any had need.
Acts		44	4	36	Now Joseph, a Levite of Cyprian birth, who was also called Barnabas by the apostles (which translated means Son of Encouragement),
Acts		44	4	37	and who owned a tract of land, sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet.
Acts		44	5	1	But a man named Ananias, with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property,
Acts		44	5	2	and kept back some of the price for himself, with his wife's full knowledge, and bringing a portion of it, he laid it at the apostles' feet.
Acts		44	5	3	But Peter said, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back some of the price of the land?
Acts		44	5	4	"While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not under your control? Why is it that you have conceived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God."
Acts		44	5	5	And as he heard these words, Ananias fell down and breathed his last; and great fear came over all who heard of it.
Acts		44	5	6	The young men got up and covered him up, and after carrying him out, they buried him.
Acts		44	5	7	Now there elapsed an interval of about three hours, and his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.
Acts		44	5	8	And Peter responded to her, "Tell me whether you sold the land for such and such a price?" And she said, "Yes, that was the price."
Acts		44	5	9	Then Peter said to her, "Why is it that you have agreed together to put the Spirit of the Lord to the test? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out as well."
Acts		44	5	10	And immediately she fell at his feet and breathed her last, and the young men came in and found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband.
Acts		44	5	11	And great fear came over the whole church, and over all who heard of these things.
Acts		44	5	12	At the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were taking place among the people; and they were all with one accord in Solomon's portico.
Acts		44	5	13	But none of the rest dared to associate with them; however, the people held them in high esteem.
Acts		44	5	14	And all the more believers in the Lord, multitudes of men and women, were constantly added to their number,
Acts		44	5	15	to such an extent that they even carried the sick out into the streets and laid them on cots and pallets, so that when Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on any one of them.
Acts		44	5	16	Also the people from the cities in the vicinity of Jerusalem were coming together, bringing people who were sick or afflicted with unclean spirits, and they were all being healed.
Acts		44	5	17	But the high priest rose up, along with all his associates (that is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy.
Acts		44	5	18	They laid hands on the apostles and put them in a public jail.
Acts		44	5	19	But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the gates of the prison, and taking them out he said,
Acts		44	5	20	"Go, stand and speak to the people in the temple the whole message of this Life."
Acts		44	5	21	Upon hearing this, they entered into the temple about daybreak and began to teach. Now when the high priest and his associates came, they called the Council together, even all the Senate of the sons of Israel, and sent orders to the prison house for them to be brought.
Acts		44	5	22	But the officers who came did not find them in the prison; and they returned and reported back,
Acts		44	5	23	saying, "We found the prison house locked quite securely and the guards standing at the doors; but when we had opened up, we found no one inside."
Acts		44	5	24	Now when the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests heard these words, they were greatly perplexed about them as to what would come of this.
Acts		44	5	25	But someone came and reported to them, "The men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people!"
Acts		44	5	26	Then the captain went along with the officers and proceeded to bring them back without violence (for they were afraid of the people, that they might be stoned).
Acts		44	5	27	When they had brought them, they stood them before the Council. The high priest questioned them,
Acts		44	5	28	saying, "We gave you strict orders not to continue teaching in this name, and yet, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and intend to bring this man's blood upon us."
Acts		44	5	29	But Peter and the apostles answered, "We must obey God rather than men.
Acts		44	5	30	"The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you had put to death by hanging Him on a cross.
Acts		44	5	31	"He is the one whom God exalted to His right hand as a Prince and a Savior, to grant repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.
Acts		44	5	32	"And we are witnesses of these things; and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey Him."
Acts		44	5	33	But when they heard this, they were cut to the quick and intended to kill them.
Acts		44	5	34	But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the Law, respected by all the people, stood up in the Council and gave orders to put the men outside for a short time.
Acts		44	5	35	And he said to them, "Men of Israel, take care what you propose to do with these men.
Acts		44	5	36	"For some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody, and a group of about four hundred men joined up with him. But he was killed, and all who followed him were dispersed and came to nothing.
Acts		44	5	37	"After this man, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the census and drew away some people after him; he too perished, and all those who followed him were scattered.
Acts		44	5	38	"So in the present case, I say to you, stay away from these men and let them alone, for if this plan or action is of men, it will be overthrown;
Acts		44	5	39	but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them; or else you may even be found fighting against God."
Acts		44	5	40	They took his advice; and after calling the apostles in, they flogged them and ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and then released them.
Acts		44	5	41	So they went on their way from the presence of the Council, rejoicing that they had been considered worthy to suffer shame for His name.
Acts		44	5	42	And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they kept right on teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ.
Acts		44	6	1	Now at this time while the disciples were increasing in number, a complaint arose on the part of the Hellenistic Jews against the native Hebrews, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily serving of food.
Acts		44	6	2	So the twelve summoned the congregation of the disciples and said, "It is not desirable for us to neglect the word of God in order to serve tables.
Acts		44	6	3	"Therefore, brethren, select from among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may put in charge of this task.
Acts		44	6	4	"But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word."
Acts		44	6	5	The statement found approval with the whole congregation; and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas and Nicolas, a proselyte from Antioch.
Acts		44	6	6	And these they brought before the apostles; and after praying, they laid their hands on them.
Acts		44	6	7	The word of God kept on spreading; and the number of the disciples continued to increase greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests were becoming obedient to the faith.
Acts		44	6	8	And Stephen, full of grace and power, was performing great wonders and signs among the people.
Acts		44	6	9	But some men from what was called the Synagogue of the Freedmen, including both Cyrenians and Alexandrians, and some from Cilicia and Asia, rose up and argued with Stephen.
Acts		44	6	10	But they were unable to cope with the wisdom and the Spirit with which he was speaking.
Acts		44	6	11	Then they secretly induced men to say, "We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God."
Acts		44	6	12	And they stirred up the people, the elders and the scribes, and they came up to him and dragged him away and brought him before the Council.
Acts		44	6	13	They put forward false witnesses who said, "This man incessantly speaks against this holy place and the Law;
Acts		44	6	14	for we have heard him say that this Nazarene, Jesus, will destroy this place and alter the customs which Moses handed down to us."
Acts		44	6	15	And fixing their gaze on him, all who were sitting in the Council saw his face like the face of an angel.
Acts		44	7	1	The high priest said, "Are these things so?"
Acts		44	7	2	And he said, "Hear me, brethren and fathers! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,
Acts		44	7	3	and said to him, 'LEAVE YOUR COUNTRY AND YOUR RELATIVES, AND COME INTO THE LAND THAT I WILL SHOW YOU.'
Acts		44	7	4	"Then he left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. From there, after his father died, God had him move to this country in which you are now living.
Acts		44	7	5	"But He gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot of ground, and yet, even when he had no child, He promised that HE WOULD GIVE IT TO HIM AS A POSSESSION, AND TO HIS DESCENDANTS AFTER HIM.
Acts		44	7	6	"But God spoke to this effect, that his DESCENDANTS WOULD BE ALIENS IN A FOREIGN LAND, AND THAT THEY WOULD BE ENSLAVED AND MISTREATED FOR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS.
Acts		44	7	7	" 'AND WHATEVER NATION TO WHICH THEY WILL BE IN BONDAGE I MYSELF WILL JUDGE,' said God, 'AND AFTER THAT THEY WILL COME OUT AND SERVE ME IN THIS PLACE.'
Acts		44	7	8	"And He gave him the covenant of circumcision; and so Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs.
Acts		44	7	9	"The patriarchs became jealous of Joseph and sold him into Egypt. Yet God was with him,
Acts		44	7	10	and rescued him from all his afflictions, and granted him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he made him governor over Egypt and all his household.
Acts		44	7	11	"Now a famine came over all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction with it, and our fathers could find no food.
Acts		44	7	12	"But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our fathers there the first time.
Acts		44	7	13	"On the second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph's family was disclosed to Pharaoh.
Acts		44	7	14	"Then Joseph sent word and invited Jacob his father and all his relatives to come to him, seventy-five persons in all.
Acts		44	7	15	"And Jacob went down to Egypt and there he and our fathers died.
Acts		44	7	16	"From there they were removed to Shechem and laid in the tomb which Abraham had purchased for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.
Acts		44	7	17	"But as the time of the promise was approaching which God had assured to Abraham, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt,
Acts		44	7	18	until THERE AROSE ANOTHER KING OVER EGYPT WHO KNEW NOTHING ABOUT JOSEPH.
Acts		44	7	19	"It was he who took shrewd advantage of our race and mistreated our fathers so that they would expose their infants and they would not survive.
Acts		44	7	20	"It was at this time that Moses was born; and he was lovely in the sight of God, and he was nurtured three months in his father's home.
Acts		44	7	21	"And after he had been set outside, Pharaoh's daughter took him away and nurtured him as her own son.
Acts		44	7	22	"Moses was educated in all the learning of the Egyptians, and he was a man of power in words and deeds.
Acts		44	7	23	"But when he was approaching the age of forty, it entered his mind to visit his brethren, the sons of Israel.
Acts		44	7	24	"And when he saw one of them being treated unjustly, he defended him and took vengeance for the oppressed by striking down the Egyptian.
Acts		44	7	25	"And he supposed that his brethren understood that God was granting them deliverance through him, but they did not understand.
Acts		44	7	26	"On the following day he appeared to them as they were fighting together, and he tried to reconcile them in peace, saying, 'Men, you are brethren, why do you injure one another?'
Acts		44	7	27	"But the one who was injuring his neighbor pushed him away, saying, 'WHO MADE YOU A RULER AND JUDGE OVER US?
Acts		44	7	28	'YOU DO NOT MEAN TO KILL ME AS YOU KILLED THE EGYPTIAN YESTERDAY, DO YOU?'
Acts		44	7	29	"At this remark, MOSES FLED AND BECAME AN ALIEN IN THE LAND OF MIDIAN, where he became the father of two sons.
Acts		44	7	30	"After forty years had passed, AN ANGEL APPEARED TO HIM IN THE WILDERNESS OF MOUNT Sinai, IN THE FLAME OF A BURNING THORN BUSH.
Acts		44	7	31	"When Moses saw it, he marveled at the sight; and as he approached to look more closely, there came the voice of the Lord:
Acts		44	7	32	'I AM THE GOD OF YOUR FATHERS, THE GOD OF ABRAHAM AND ISAAC AND JACOB.' Moses shook with fear and would not venture to look.
Acts		44	7	33	"BUT THE LORD SAID TO HIM, 'TAKE OFF THE SANDALS FROM YOUR FEET, FOR THE PLACE ON WHICH YOU ARE STANDING IS HOLY GROUND.
Acts		44	7	34	'I HAVE CERTAINLY SEEN THE OPPRESSION OF MY PEOPLE IN EGYPT AND HAVE HEARD THEIR GROANS, AND I HAVE COME DOWN TO RESCUE THEM; COME NOW, AND I WILL SEND YOU TO EGYPT.'
Acts		44	7	35	"This Moses whom they disowned, saying, 'WHO MADE YOU A RULER AND A JUDGE?' is the one whom God sent to be both a ruler and a deliverer with the help of the angel who appeared to him in the thorn bush.
Acts		44	7	36	"This man led them out, performing wonders and signs in the land of Egypt and in the Red Sea and in the wilderness for forty years.
Acts		44	7	37	"This is the Moses who said to the sons of Israel, 'GOD WILL RAISE UP FOR YOU A PROPHET LIKE ME FROM YOUR BRETHREN.'
Acts		44	7	38	"This is the one who was in the congregation in the wilderness together with the angel who was speaking to him on Mount Sinai, and who was with our fathers; and he received living oracles to pass on to you.
Acts		44	7	39	"Our fathers were unwilling to be obedient to him, but repudiated him and in their hearts turned back to Egypt,
Acts		44	7	40	SAYING TO AARON, 'MAKE FOR US GODS WHO WILL GO BEFORE US; FOR THIS MOSES WHO LED US OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT--WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.'
Acts		44	7	41	"At that time they made a calf and brought a sacrifice to the idol, and were rejoicing in the works of their hands.
Acts		44	7	42	"But God turned away and delivered them up to serve the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, 'IT WAS NOT TO ME THAT YOU OFFERED VICTIMS AND SACRIFICES FORTY YEARS IN THE WILDERNESS, WAS IT, O HOUSE OF ISRAEL?
Acts		44	7	43	'YOU ALSO TOOK ALONG THE TABERNACLE OF MOLOCH AND THE STAR OF THE GOD ROMPHA, THE IMAGES WHICH YOU MADE TO WORSHIP. I ALSO WILL REMOVE YOU BEYOND BABYLON.'
Acts		44	7	44	"Our fathers had the tabernacle of testimony in the wilderness, just as He who spoke to Moses directed him to make it according to the pattern which he had seen.
Acts		44	7	45	"And having received it in their turn, our fathers brought it in with Joshua upon dispossessing the nations whom God drove out before our fathers, until the time of David.
Acts		44	7	46	"David found favor in God's sight, and asked that he might find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.
Acts		44	7	47	"But it was Solomon who built a house for Him.
Acts		44	7	48	"However, the Most High does not dwell in houses made by human hands; as the prophet says:
Acts		44	7	49	'HEAVEN IS MY THRONE, AND EARTH IS THE FOOTSTOOL OF MY FEET; WHAT KIND OF HOUSE WILL YOU BUILD FOR ME?' says the Lord, 'OR WHAT PLACE IS THERE FOR MY REPOSE?
Acts		44	7	50	'WAS IT NOT MY HAND WHICH MADE ALL THESE THINGS?'
Acts		44	7	51	"You men who are stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears are always resisting the Holy Spirit; you are doing just as your fathers did.
Acts		44	7	52	"Which one of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? They killed those who had previously announced the coming of the Righteous One, whose betrayers and murderers you have now become;
Acts		44	7	53	you who received the law as ordained by angels, and yet did not keep it."
Acts		44	7	54	Now when they heard this, they were cut to the quick, and they began gnashing their teeth at him.
Acts		44	7	55	But being full of the Holy Spirit, he gazed intently into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God;
Acts		44	7	56	and he said, "Behold, I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God."
Acts		44	7	57	But they cried out with a loud voice, and covered their ears and rushed at him with one impulse.
Acts		44	7	58	When they had driven him out of the city, they began stoning him; and the witnesses laid aside their robes at the feet of a young man named Saul.
Acts		44	7	59	They went on stoning Stephen as he called on the Lord and said, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!"
Acts		44	7	60	Then falling on his knees, he cried out with a loud voice, "Lord, do not hold this sin against them!" Having said this, he fell asleep.
Acts		44	8	1	Saul was in hearty agreement with putting him to death. And on that day a great persecution began against the church in Jerusalem, and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.
Acts		44	8	2	Some devout men buried Stephen, and made loud lamentation over him.
Acts		44	8	3	But Saul began ravaging the church, entering house after house, and dragging off men and women, he would put them in prison.
Acts		44	8	4	Therefore, those who had been scattered went about preaching the word.
Acts		44	8	5	Philip went down to the city of Samaria and began proclaiming Christ to them.
Acts		44	8	6	The crowds with one accord were giving attention to what was said by Philip, as they heard and saw the signs which he was performing.
Acts		44	8	7	For in the case of many who had unclean spirits, they were coming out of them shouting with a loud voice; and many who had been paralyzed and lame were healed.
Acts		44	8	8	So there was much rejoicing in that city.
Acts		44	8	9	Now there was a man named Simon, who formerly was practicing magic in the city and astonishing the people of Samaria, claiming to be someone great;
Acts		44	8	10	and they all, from smallest to greatest, were giving attention to him, saying, "This man is what is called the Great Power of God."
Acts		44	8	11	And they were giving him attention because he had for a long time astonished them with his magic arts.
Acts		44	8	12	But when they believed Philip preaching the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were being baptized, men and women alike.
Acts		44	8	13	Even Simon himself believed; and after being baptized, he continued on with Philip, and as he observed signs and great miracles taking place, he was constantly amazed.
Acts		44	8	14	Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent them Peter and John,
Acts		44	8	15	who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit.
Acts		44	8	16	For He had not yet fallen upon any of them; they had simply been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
Acts		44	8	17	Then they began laying their hands on them, and they were receiving the Holy Spirit.
Acts		44	8	18	Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was bestowed through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money,
Acts		44	8	19	saying, "Give this authority to me as well, so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit."
Acts		44	8	20	But Peter said to him, "May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money!
Acts		44	8	21	"You have no part or portion in this matter, for your heart is not right before God.
Acts		44	8	22	"Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray the Lord that, if possible, the intention of your heart may be forgiven you.
Acts		44	8	23	"For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bondage of iniquity."
Acts		44	8	24	But Simon answered and said, "Pray to the Lord for me yourselves, so that nothing of what you have said may come upon me."
Acts		44	8	25	So, when they had solemnly testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they started back to Jerusalem, and were preaching the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.
Acts		44	8	26	But an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip saying, "Get up and go south to the road that descends from Jerusalem to Gaza." (This is a desert road.)
Acts		44	8	27	So he got up and went; and there was an Ethiopian eunuch, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasure; and he had come to Jerusalem to worship,
Acts		44	8	28	and he was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah.
Acts		44	8	29	Then the Spirit said to Philip, "Go up and join this chariot."
Acts		44	8	30	Philip ran up and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, "Do you understand what you are reading?"
Acts		44	8	31	And he said, "Well, how could I, unless someone guides me?" And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.
Acts		44	8	32	Now the passage of Scripture which he was reading was this: "HE WAS LED AS A SHEEP TO SLAUGHTER; AND AS A LAMB BEFORE ITS SHEARER IS SILENT, SO HE DOES NOT OPEN HIS MOUTH.
Acts		44	8	33	"IN HUMILIATION HIS JUDGMENT WAS TAKEN AWAY; WHO WILL RELATE HIS GENERATION? FOR HIS LIFE IS REMOVED FROM THE EARTH."
Acts		44	8	34	The eunuch answered Philip and said, "Please tell me, of whom does the prophet say this? Of himself or of someone else?"
Acts		44	8	35	Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture he preached Jesus to him.
Acts		44	8	36	As they went along the road they came to some water; and the eunuch *said, "Look! Water! What prevents me from being baptized?"
Acts		44	8	37	[And Philip said, "If you believe with all your heart, you may." And he answered and said, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God."]
Acts		44	8	38	And he ordered the chariot to stop; and they both went down into the water, Philip as well as the eunuch, and he baptized him.
Acts		44	8	39	When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away; and the eunuch no longer saw him, but went on his way rejoicing.
Acts		44	8	40	But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he passed through he kept preaching the gospel to all the cities until he came to Caesarea.
Acts		44	9	1	Now Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,
Acts		44	9	2	and asked for letters from him to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the Way, both men and women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
Acts		44	9	3	As he was traveling, it happened that he was approaching Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him;
Acts		44	9	4	and he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?"
Acts		44	9	5	And he said, "Who are You, Lord?" And He said, "I am Jesus whom you are persecuting,
Acts		44	9	6	but get up and enter the city, and it will be told you what you must do."
Acts		44	9	7	The men who traveled with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one.
Acts		44	9	8	Saul got up from the ground, and though his eyes were open, he could see nothing; and leading him by the hand, they brought him into Damascus.
Acts		44	9	9	And he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank.
Acts		44	9	10	Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias; and the Lord said to him in a vision, "Ananias." And he said, "Here I am, Lord."
Acts		44	9	11	And the Lord said to him, "Get up and go to the street called Straight, and inquire at the house of Judas for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying,
Acts		44	9	12	and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him, so that he might regain his sight."
Acts		44	9	13	But Ananias answered, "Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much harm he did to Your saints at Jerusalem;
Acts		44	9	14	and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on Your name."
Acts		44	9	15	But the Lord said to him, "Go, for he is a chosen instrument of Mine, to bear My name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel;
Acts		44	9	16	for I will show him how much he must suffer for My name's sake."
Acts		44	9	17	So Ananias departed and entered the house, and after laying his hands on him said, "Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road by which you were coming, has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit."
Acts		44	9	18	And immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales, and he regained his sight, and he got up and was baptized;
Acts		44	9	19	and he took food and was strengthened. Now for several days he was with the disciples who were at Damascus,
Acts		44	9	20	and immediately he began to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues, saying, "He is the Son of God."
Acts		44	9	21	All those hearing him continued to be amazed, and were saying, "Is this not he who in Jerusalem destroyed those who called on this name, and who had come here for the purpose of bringing them bound before the chief priests?"
Acts		44	9	22	But Saul kept increasing in strength and confounding the Jews who lived at Damascus by proving that this Jesus is the Christ.
Acts		44	9	23	When many days had elapsed, the Jews plotted together to do away with him,
Acts		44	9	24	but their plot became known to Saul. They were also watching the gates day and night so that they might put him to death;
Acts		44	9	25	but his disciples took him by night and let him down through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a large basket.
Acts		44	9	26	When he came to Jerusalem, he was trying to associate with the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.
Acts		44	9	27	But Barnabas took hold of him and brought him to the apostles and described to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that He had talked to him, and how at Damascus he had spoken out boldly in the name of Jesus.
Acts		44	9	28	And he was with them, moving about freely in Jerusalem, speaking out boldly in the name of the Lord.
Acts		44	9	29	And he was talking and arguing with the Hellenistic Jews; but they were attempting to put him to death.
Acts		44	9	30	But when the brethren learned of it, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus.
Acts		44	9	31	So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria enjoyed peace, being built up; and going on in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it continued to increase.
Acts		44	9	32	Now as Peter was traveling through all those regions, he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda.
Acts		44	9	33	There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden eight years, for he was paralyzed.
Acts		44	9	34	Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you; get up and make your bed." Immediately he got up.
Acts		44	9	35	And all who lived at Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.
Acts		44	9	36	Now in Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha (which translated in Greek is called Dorcas); this woman was abounding with deeds of kindness and charity which she continually did.
Acts		44	9	37	And it happened at that time that she fell sick and died; and when they had washed her body, they laid it in an upper room.
Acts		44	9	38	Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, having heard that Peter was there, sent two men to him, imploring him, "Do not delay in coming to us."
Acts		44	9	39	So Peter arose and went with them. When he arrived, they brought him into the upper room; and all the widows stood beside him, weeping and showing all the tunics and garments that Dorcas used to make while she was with them.
Acts		44	9	40	But Peter sent them all out and knelt down and prayed, and turning to the body, he said, "Tabitha, arise." And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up.
Acts		44	9	41	And he gave her his hand and raised her up; and calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive.
Acts		44	9	42	It became known all over Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.
Acts		44	9	43	And Peter stayed many days in Joppa with a tanner named Simon.
Acts		44	10	1	Now there was a man at Caesarea named Cornelius, a centurion of what was called the Italian cohort,
Acts		44	10	2	a devout man and one who feared God with all his household, and gave many alms to the Jewish people and prayed to God continually.
Acts		44	10	3	About the ninth hour of the day he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God who had just come in and said to him, "Cornelius!"
Acts		44	10	4	And fixing his gaze on him and being much alarmed, he said, "What is it, Lord?" And he said to him, "Your prayers and alms have ascended as a memorial before God.
Acts		44	10	5	"Now dispatch some men to Joppa and send for a man named Simon, who is also called Peter;
Acts		44	10	6	he is staying with a tanner named Simon, whose house is by the sea."
Acts		44	10	7	When the angel who was speaking to him had left, he summoned two of his servants and a devout soldier of those who were his personal attendants,
Acts		44	10	8	and after he had explained everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.
Acts		44	10	9	On the next day, as they were on their way and approaching the city, Peter went up on the housetop about the sixth hour to pray.
Acts		44	10	10	But he became hungry and was desiring to eat; but while they were making preparations, he fell into a trance;
Acts		44	10	11	and he *saw the sky opened up, and an object like a great sheet coming down, lowered by four corners to the ground,
Acts		44	10	12	and there were in it all kinds of four-footed animals and crawling creatures of the earth and birds of the air.
Acts		44	10	13	A voice came to him, "Get up, Peter, kill and eat!"
Acts		44	10	14	But Peter said, "By no means, Lord, for I have never eaten anything unholy and unclean."
Acts		44	10	15	Again a voice came to him a second time, "What God has cleansed, no longer consider unholy."
Acts		44	10	16	This happened three times, and immediately the object was taken up into the sky.
Acts		44	10	17	Now while Peter was greatly perplexed in mind as to what the vision which he had seen might be, behold, the men who had been sent by Cornelius, having asked directions for Simon's house, appeared at the gate;
Acts		44	10	18	and calling out, they were asking whether Simon, who was also called Peter, was staying there.
Acts		44	10	19	While Peter was reflecting on the vision, the Spirit said to him, "Behold, three men are looking for you.
Acts		44	10	20	"But get up, go downstairs and accompany them without misgivings, for I have sent them Myself."
Acts		44	10	21	Peter went down to the men and said, "Behold, I am the one you are looking for; what is the reason for which you have come?"
Acts		44	10	22	They said, "Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous and God-fearing man well spoken of by the entire nation of the Jews, was divinely directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and hear a message from you."
Acts		44	10	23	So he invited them in and gave them lodging. And on the next day he got up and went away with them, and some of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him.
Acts		44	10	24	On the following day he entered Caesarea. Now Cornelius was waiting for them and had called together his relatives and close friends.
Acts		44	10	25	When Peter entered, Cornelius met him, and fell at his feet and worshiped him.
Acts		44	10	26	But Peter raised him up, saying, "Stand up; I too am just a man."
Acts		44	10	27	As he talked with him, he entered and *found many people assembled.
Acts		44	10	28	And he said to them, "You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a man who is a Jew to associate with a foreigner or to visit him; and yet God has shown me that I should not call any man unholy or unclean.
Acts		44	10	29	"That is why I came without even raising any objection when I was sent for. So I ask for what reason you have sent for me."
Acts		44	10	30	Cornelius said, "Four days ago to this hour, I was praying in my house during the ninth hour; and behold, a man stood before me in shining garments,
Acts		44	10	31	and he *said, 'Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God.
Acts		44	10	32	'Therefore send to Joppa and invite Simon, who is also called Peter, to come to you; he is staying at the house of Simon the tanner by the sea.'
Acts		44	10	33	"So I sent for you immediately, and you have been kind enough to come. Now then, we are all here present before God to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord."
Acts		44	10	34	Opening his mouth, Peter said: "I most certainly understand now that God is not one to show partiality,
Acts		44	10	35	but in every nation the man who fears Him and does what is right is welcome to Him.
Acts		44	10	36	"The word which He sent to the sons of Israel, preaching peace through Jesus Christ (He is Lord of all)--
Acts		44	10	37	you yourselves know the thing which took place throughout all Judea, starting from Galilee, after the baptism which John proclaimed.
Acts		44	10	38	"You know of Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed Him with the Holy Spirit and with power, and how He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him.
Acts		44	10	39	"We are witnesses of all the things He did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They also put Him to death by hanging Him on a cross.
Acts		44	10	40	"God raised Him up on the third day and granted that He become visible,
Acts		44	10	41	not to all the people, but to witnesses who were chosen beforehand by God, that is, to us who ate and drank with Him after He arose from the dead.
Acts		44	10	42	"And He ordered us to preach to the people, and solemnly to testify that this is the One who has been appointed by God as Judge of the living and the dead.
Acts		44	10	43	"Of Him all the prophets bear witness that through His name everyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins."
Acts		44	10	44	While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who were listening to the message.
Acts		44	10	45	All the circumcised believers who came with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles also.
Acts		44	10	46	For they were hearing them speaking with tongues and exalting God. Then Peter answered,
Acts		44	10	47	"Surely no one can refuse the water for these to be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit just as we did, can he?"
Acts		44	10	48	And he ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay on for a few days.
Acts		44	11	1	Now the apostles and the brethren who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.
Acts		44	11	2	And when Peter came up to Jerusalem, those who were circumcised took issue with him,
Acts		44	11	3	saying, "You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them."
Acts		44	11	4	But Peter began speaking and proceeded to explain to them in orderly sequence, saying,
Acts		44	11	5	"I was in the city of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision, an object coming down like a great sheet lowered by four corners from the sky; and it came right down to me,
Acts		44	11	6	and when I had fixed my gaze on it and was observing it I saw the four-footed animals of the earth and the wild beasts and the crawling creatures and the birds of the air.
Acts		44	11	7	"I also heard a voice saying to me, 'Get up, Peter; kill and eat.'
Acts		44	11	8	"But I said, 'By no means, Lord, for nothing unholy or unclean has ever entered my mouth.'
Acts		44	11	9	"But a voice from heaven answered a second time, 'What God has cleansed, no longer consider unholy.'
Acts		44	11	10	"This happened three times, and everything was drawn back up into the sky.
Acts		44	11	11	"And behold, at that moment three men appeared at the house in which we were staying, having been sent to me from Caesarea.
Acts		44	11	12	"The Spirit told me to go with them without misgivings. These six brethren also went with me and we entered the man's house.
Acts		44	11	13	"And he reported to us how he had seen the angel standing in his house, and saying, 'Send to Joppa and have Simon, who is also called Peter, brought here;
Acts		44	11	14	and he will speak words to you by which you will be saved, you and all your household.'
Acts		44	11	15	"And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them just as He did upon us at the beginning.
Acts		44	11	16	"And I remembered the word of the Lord, how He used to say, 'John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'
Acts		44	11	17	"Therefore if God gave to them the same gift as He gave to us also after believing in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could stand in God's way?"
Acts		44	11	18	When they heard this, they quieted down and glorified God, saying, "Well then, God has granted to the Gentiles also the repentance that leads to life."
Acts		44	11	19	So then those who were scattered because of the persecution that occurred in connection with Stephen made their way to Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except to Jews alone.
Acts		44	11	20	But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who came to Antioch and began speaking to the Greeks also, preaching the Lord Jesus.
Acts		44	11	21	And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a large number who believed turned to the Lord.
Acts		44	11	22	The news about them reached the ears of the church at Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas off to Antioch.
Acts		44	11	23	Then when he arrived and witnessed the grace of God, he rejoiced and began to encourage them all with resolute heart to remain true to the Lord;
Acts		44	11	24	for he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And considerable numbers were brought to the Lord.
Acts		44	11	25	And he left for Tarsus to look for Saul;
Acts		44	11	26	and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And for an entire year they met with the church and taught considerable numbers; and the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.
Acts		44	11	27	Now at this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.
Acts		44	11	28	One of them named Agabus stood up and began to indicate by the Spirit that there would certainly be a great famine all over the world. And this took place in the reign of Claudius.
Acts		44	11	29	And in the proportion that any of the disciples had means, each of them determined to send a contribution for the relief of the brethren living in Judea.
Acts		44	11	30	And this they did, sending it in charge of Barnabas and Saul to the elders.
Acts		44	12	1	Now about that time Herod the king laid hands on some who belonged to the church in order to mistreat them.
Acts		44	12	2	And he had James the brother of John put to death with a sword.
Acts		44	12	3	When he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. Now it was during the days of Unleavened Bread.
Acts		44	12	4	When he had seized him, he put him in prison, delivering him to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him out before the people.
Acts		44	12	5	So Peter was kept in the prison, but prayer for him was being made fervently by the church to God.
Acts		44	12	6	On the very night when Herod was about to bring him forward, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and guards in front of the door were watching over the prison.
Acts		44	12	7	And behold, an angel of the Lord suddenly appeared and a light shone in the cell; and he struck Peter's side and woke him up, saying, "Get up quickly." And his chains fell off his hands.
Acts		44	12	8	And the angel said to him, "Gird yourself and put on your sandals." And he did so. And he *said to him, "Wrap your cloak around you and follow me."
Acts		44	12	9	And he went out and continued to follow, and he did not know that what was being done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision.
Acts		44	12	10	When they had passed the first and second guard, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city, which opened for them by itself; and they went out and went along one street, and immediately the angel departed from him.
Acts		44	12	11	When Peter came to himself, he said, "Now I know for sure that the Lord has sent forth His angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting."
Acts		44	12	12	And when he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John who was also called Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying.
Acts		44	12	13	When he knocked at the door of the gate, a servant-girl named Rhoda came to answer.
Acts		44	12	14	When she recognized Peter's voice, because of her joy she did not open the gate, but ran in and announced that Peter was standing in front of the gate.
Acts		44	12	15	They said to her, "You are out of your mind!" But she kept insisting that it was so. They kept saying, "It is his angel."
Acts		44	12	16	But Peter continued knocking; and when they had opened the door, they saw him and were amazed.
Acts		44	12	17	But motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord had led him out of the prison. And he said, "Report these things to James and the brethren." Then he left and went to another place.
Acts		44	12	18	Now when day came, there was no small disturbance among the soldiers as to what could have become of Peter.
Acts		44	12	19	When Herod had searched for him and had not found him, he examined the guards and ordered that they be led away to execution. Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea and was spending time there.
Acts		44	12	20	Now he was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon; and with one accord they came to him, and having won over Blastus the king's chamberlain, they were asking for peace, because their country was fed by the king's country.
Acts		44	12	21	On an appointed day Herod, having put on his royal apparel, took his seat on the rostrum and began delivering an address to them.
Acts		44	12	22	The people kept crying out, "The voice of a god and not of a man!"
Acts		44	12	23	And immediately an angel of the Lord struck him because he did not give God the glory, and he was eaten by worms and died.
Acts		44	12	24	But the word of the Lord continued to grow and to be multiplied.
Acts		44	12	25	And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had fulfilled their mission, taking along with them John, who was also called Mark.
Acts		44	13	1	Now there were at Antioch, in the church that was there, prophets and teachers: Barnabas, and Simeon who was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
Acts		44	13	2	While they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart for Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them."
Acts		44	13	3	Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.
Acts		44	13	4	So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia and from there they sailed to Cyprus.
Acts		44	13	5	When they reached Salamis, they began to proclaim the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews; and they also had John as their helper.
Acts		44	13	6	When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they found a magician, a Jewish false prophet whose name was Bar-Jesus,
Acts		44	13	7	who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God.
Acts		44	13	8	But Elymas the magician (for so his name is translated) was opposing them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith.
Acts		44	13	9	But Saul, who was also known as Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fixed his gaze on him,
Acts		44	13	10	and said, "You who are full of all deceit and fraud, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to make crooked the straight ways of the Lord?
Acts		44	13	11	"Now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind and not see the sun for a time." And immediately a mist and a darkness fell upon him, and he went about seeking those who would lead him by the hand.
Acts		44	13	12	Then the proconsul believed when he saw what had happened, being amazed at the teaching of the Lord.
Acts		44	13	13	Now Paul and his companions put out to sea from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia; but John left them and returned to Jerusalem.
Acts		44	13	14	But going on from Perga, they arrived at Pisidian Antioch, and on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down.
Acts		44	13	15	After the reading of the Law and the Prophets the synagogue officials sent to them, saying, "Brethren, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say it."
Acts		44	13	16	Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said, "Men of Israel, and you who fear God, listen:
Acts		44	13	17	"The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm He led them out from it.
Acts		44	13	18	"For a period of about forty years He put up with them in the wilderness.
Acts		44	13	19	"When He had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, He distributed their land as an inheritance--all of which took about four hundred and fifty years.
Acts		44	13	20	"After these things He gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.
Acts		44	13	21	"Then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.
Acts		44	13	22	"After He had removed him, He raised up David to be their king, concerning whom He also testified and said, 'I HAVE FOUND DAVID the son of Jesse, A MAN AFTER MY HEART, who will do all My will.'
Acts		44	13	23	"From the descendants of this man, according to promise, God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus,
Acts		44	13	24	after John had proclaimed before His coming a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
Acts		44	13	25	"And while John was completing his course, he kept saying, 'What do you suppose that I am? I am not He. But behold, one is coming after me the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.'
Acts		44	13	26	"Brethren, sons of Abraham's family, and those among you who fear God, to us the message of this salvation has been sent.
Acts		44	13	27	"For those who live in Jerusalem, and their rulers, recognizing neither Him nor the utterances of the prophets which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled these by condemning Him.
Acts		44	13	28	"And though they found no ground for putting Him to death, they asked Pilate that He be executed.
Acts		44	13	29	"When they had carried out all that was written concerning Him, they took Him down from the cross and laid Him in a tomb.
Acts		44	13	30	"But God raised Him from the dead;
Acts		44	13	31	and for many days He appeared to those who came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, the very ones who are now His witnesses to the people.
Acts		44	13	32	"And we preach to you the good news of the promise made to the fathers,
Acts		44	13	33	that God has fulfilled this promise to our children in that He raised up Jesus, as it is also written in the second Psalm, 'YOU ARE MY SON; TODAY I HAVE BEGOTTEN YOU.'
Acts		44	13	34	"As for the fact that He raised Him up from the dead, no longer to return to decay, He has spoken in this way: 'I WILL GIVE YOU THE HOLY and SURE blessings OF DAVID.'
Acts		44	13	35	"Therefore He also says in another Psalm, 'YOU WILL NOT ALLOW YOUR HOLY ONE TO UNDERGO DECAY.'
Acts		44	13	36	"For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation, fell asleep, and was laid among his fathers and underwent decay;
Acts		44	13	37	but He whom God raised did not undergo decay.
Acts		44	13	38	"Therefore let it be known to you, brethren, that through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you,
Acts		44	13	39	and through Him everyone who believes is freed from all things, from which you could not be freed through the Law of Moses.
Acts		44	13	40	"Therefore take heed, so that the thing spoken of in the Prophets may not come upon you:
Acts		44	13	41	'BEHOLD, YOU SCOFFERS, AND MARVEL, AND PERISH; FOR I AM ACCOMPLISHING A WORK IN YOUR DAYS, A WORK WHICH YOU WILL NEVER BELIEVE, THOUGH SOMEONE SHOULD DESCRIBE IT TO YOU.'"
Acts		44	13	42	As Paul and Barnabas were going out, the people kept begging that these things might be spoken to them the next Sabbath.
Acts		44	13	43	Now when the meeting of the synagogue had broken up, many of the Jews and of the God-fearing proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who, speaking to them, were urging them to continue in the grace of God.
Acts		44	13	44	The next Sabbath nearly the whole city assembled to hear the word of the Lord.
Acts		44	13	45	But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began contradicting the things spoken by Paul, and were blaspheming.
Acts		44	13	46	Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and said, "It was necessary that the word of God be spoken to you first; since you repudiate it and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we are turning to the Gentiles.
Acts		44	13	47	"For so the Lord has commanded us, 'I HAVE PLACED YOU AS A LIGHT FOR THE GENTILES, THAT YOU MAY BRING SALVATION TO THE END OF THE EARTH.'"
Acts		44	13	48	When the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord; and as many as had been appointed to eternal life believed.
Acts		44	13	49	And the word of the Lord was being spread through the whole region.
Acts		44	13	50	But the Jews incited the devout women of prominence and the leading men of the city, and instigated a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their district.
Acts		44	13	51	But they shook off the dust of their feet in protest against them and went to Iconium.
Acts		44	13	52	And the disciples were continually filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.
Acts		44	14	1	In Iconium they entered the synagogue of the Jews together, and spoke in such a manner that a large number of people believed, both of Jews and of Greeks.
Acts		44	14	2	But the Jews who disbelieved stirred up the minds of the Gentiles and embittered them against the brethren.
Acts		44	14	3	Therefore they spent a long time there speaking boldly with reliance upon the Lord, who was testifying to the word of His grace, granting that signs and wonders be done by their hands.
Acts		44	14	4	But the people of the city were divided; and some sided with the Jews, and some with the apostles.
Acts		44	14	5	And when an attempt was made by both the Gentiles and the Jews with their rulers, to mistreat and to stone them,
Acts		44	14	6	they became aware of it and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the surrounding region;
Acts		44	14	7	and there they continued to preach the gospel.
Acts		44	14	8	At Lystra a man was sitting who had no strength in his feet, lame from his mother's womb, who had never walked.
Acts		44	14	9	This man was listening to Paul as he spoke, who, when he had fixed his gaze on him and had seen that he had faith to be made well,
Acts		44	14	10	said with a loud voice, "Stand upright on your feet." And he leaped up and began to walk.
Acts		44	14	11	When the crowds saw what Paul had done, they raised their voice, saying in the Lycaonian language, "The gods have become like men and have come down to us."
Acts		44	14	12	And they began calling Barnabas, Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, because he was the chief speaker.
Acts		44	14	13	The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and wanted to offer sacrifice with the crowds.
Acts		44	14	14	But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their robes and rushed out into the crowd, crying out
Acts		44	14	15	and saying, "Men, why are you doing these things? We are also men of the same nature as you, and preach the gospel to you that you should turn from these vain things to a living God, WHO MADE THE HEAVEN AND THE EARTH AND THE SEA AND ALL THAT IS IN THEM.
Acts		44	14	16	"In the generations gone by He permitted all the nations to go their own ways;
Acts		44	14	17	and yet He did not leave Himself without witness, in that He did good and gave you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness."
Acts		44	14	18	Even saying these things, with difficulty they restrained the crowds from offering sacrifice to them.
Acts		44	14	19	But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and having won over the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing him to be dead.
Acts		44	14	20	But while the disciples stood around him, he got up and entered the city. The next day he went away with Barnabas to Derbe.
Acts		44	14	21	After they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch,
Acts		44	14	22	strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and saying, "Through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God."
Acts		44	14	23	When they had appointed elders for them in every church, having prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed.
Acts		44	14	24	They passed through Pisidia and came into Pamphylia.
Acts		44	14	25	When they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.
Acts		44	14	26	From there they sailed to Antioch, from which they had been commended to the grace of God for the work that they had accomplished.
Acts		44	14	27	When they had arrived and gathered the church together, they began to report all things that God had done with them and how He had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.
Acts		44	14	28	And they spent a long time with the disciples.
Acts		44	15	1	Some men came down from Judea and began teaching the brethren, "Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved."
Acts		44	15	2	And when Paul and Barnabas had great dissension and debate with them, the brethren determined that Paul and Barnabas and some others of them should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders concerning this issue.
Acts		44	15	3	Therefore, being sent on their way by the church, they were passing through both Phoenicia and Samaria, describing in detail the conversion of the Gentiles, and were bringing great joy to all the brethren.
Acts		44	15	4	When they arrived at Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they reported all that God had done with them.
Acts		44	15	5	But some of the sect of the Pharisees who had believed stood up, saying, "It is necessary to circumcise them and to direct them to observe the Law of Moses."
Acts		44	15	6	The apostles and the elders came together to look into this matter.
Acts		44	15	7	After there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, "Brethren, you know that in the early days God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles would hear the word of the gospel and believe.
Acts		44	15	8	"And God, who knows the heart, testified to them giving them the Holy Spirit, just as He also did to us;
Acts		44	15	9	and He made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith.
Acts		44	15	10	"Now therefore why do you put God to the test by placing upon the neck of the disciples a yoke which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?
Acts		44	15	11	"But we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in the same way as they also are."
Acts		44	15	12	All the people kept silent, and they were listening to Barnabas and Paul as they were relating what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles.
Acts		44	15	13	After they had stopped speaking, James answered, saying, "Brethren, listen to me.
Acts		44	15	14	"Simeon has related how God first concerned Himself about taking from among the Gentiles a people for His name.
Acts		44	15	15	"With this the words of the Prophets agree, just as it is written,
Acts		44	15	16	'AFTER THESE THINGS I will return, AND I WILL REBUILD THE TABERNACLE OF DAVID WHICH HAS FALLEN, AND I WILL REBUILD ITS RUINS, AND I WILL RESTORE IT,
Acts		44	15	17	SO THAT THE REST OF MANKIND MAY SEEK THE LORD, AND ALL THE GENTILES WHO ARE CALLED BY MY NAME,'
Acts		44	15	18	SAYS THE LORD, WHO MAKES THESE THINGS KNOWN FROM LONG AGO.
Acts		44	15	19	"Therefore it is my judgment that we do not trouble those who are turning to God from among the Gentiles,
Acts		44	15	20	but that we write to them that they abstain from things contaminated by idols and from fornication and from what is strangled and from blood.
Acts		44	15	21	"For Moses from ancient generations has in every city those who preach him, since he is read in the synagogues every Sabbath."
Acts		44	15	22	Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men from among them to send to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas--Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren,
Acts		44	15	23	and they sent this letter by them, "The apostles and the brethren who are elders, to the brethren in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia who are from the Gentiles, greetings.
Acts		44	15	24	"Since we have heard that some of our number to whom we gave no instruction have disturbed you with their words, unsettling your souls,
Acts		44	15	25	it seemed good to us, having become of one mind, to select men to send to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
Acts		44	15	26	men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Acts		44	15	27	"Therefore we have sent Judas and Silas, who themselves will also report the same things by word of mouth.
Acts		44	15	28	"For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these essentials:
Acts		44	15	29	that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication; if you keep yourselves free from such things, you will do well. Farewell."
Acts		44	15	30	So when they were sent away, they went down to Antioch; and having gathered the congregation together, they delivered the letter.
Acts		44	15	31	When they had read it, they rejoiced because of its encouragement.
Acts		44	15	32	Judas and Silas, also being prophets themselves, encouraged and strengthened the brethren with a lengthy message.
Acts		44	15	33	After they had spent time there, they were sent away from the brethren in peace to those who had sent them out.
Acts		44	15	34	[But it seemed good to Silas to remain there.]
Acts		44	15	35	But Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch, teaching and preaching with many others also, the word of the Lord.
Acts		44	15	36	After some days Paul said to Barnabas, "Let us return and visit the brethren in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are."
Acts		44	15	37	Barnabas wanted to take John, called Mark, along with them also.
Acts		44	15	38	But Paul kept insisting that they should not take him along who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work.
Acts		44	15	39	And there occurred such a sharp disagreement that they separated from one another, and Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus.
Acts		44	15	40	But Paul chose Silas and left, being committed by the brethren to the grace of the Lord.
Acts		44	15	41	And he was traveling through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.
Acts		44	16	1	Paul came also to Derbe and to Lystra. And a disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was a Greek,
Acts		44	16	2	and he was well spoken of by the brethren who were in Lystra and Iconium.
Acts		44	16	3	Paul wanted this man to go with him; and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
Acts		44	16	4	Now while they were passing through the cities, they were delivering the decrees which had been decided upon by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem, for them to observe.
Acts		44	16	5	So the churches were being strengthened in the faith, and were increasing in number daily.
Acts		44	16	6	They passed through the Phrygian and Galatian region, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia;
Acts		44	16	7	and after they came to Mysia, they were trying to go into Bithynia, and the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them;
Acts		44	16	8	and passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas.
Acts		44	16	9	A vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man of Macedonia was standing and appealing to him, and saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us."
Acts		44	16	10	When he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.
Acts		44	16	11	So putting out to sea from Troas, we ran a straight course to Samothrace, and on the day following to Neapolis;
Acts		44	16	12	and from there to Philippi, which is a leading city of the district of Macedonia, a Roman colony; and we were staying in this city for some days.
Acts		44	16	13	And on the Sabbath day we went outside the gate to a riverside, where we were supposing that there would be a place of prayer; and we sat down and began speaking to the women who had assembled.
Acts		44	16	14	A woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple fabrics, a worshiper of God, was listening; and the Lord opened her heart to respond to the things spoken by Paul.
Acts		44	16	15	And when she and her household had been baptized, she urged us, saying, "If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and stay." And she prevailed upon us.
Acts		44	16	16	It happened that as we were going to the place of prayer, a slave-girl having a spirit of divination met us, who was bringing her masters much profit by fortune-telling.
Acts		44	16	17	Following after Paul and us, she kept crying out, saying, "These men are bond-servants of the Most High God, who are proclaiming to you the way of salvation."
Acts		44	16	18	She continued doing this for many days. But Paul was greatly annoyed, and turned and said to the spirit, "I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!" And it came out at that very moment.
Acts		44	16	19	But when her masters saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the market place before the authorities,
Acts		44	16	20	and when they had brought them to the chief magistrates, they said, "These men are throwing our city into confusion, being Jews,
Acts		44	16	21	and are proclaiming customs which it is not lawful for us to accept or to observe, being Romans."
Acts		44	16	22	The crowd rose up together against them, and the chief magistrates tore their robes off them and proceeded to order them to be beaten with rods.
Acts		44	16	23	When they had struck them with many blows, they threw them into prison, commanding the jailer to guard them securely;
Acts		44	16	24	and he, having received such a command, threw them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.
Acts		44	16	25	But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns of praise to God, and the prisoners were listening to them;
Acts		44	16	26	and suddenly there came a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison house were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone's chains were unfastened.
Acts		44	16	27	When the jailer awoke and saw the prison doors opened, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.
Acts		44	16	28	But Paul cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Do not harm yourself, for we are all here!"
Acts		44	16	29	And he called for lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear he fell down before Paul and Silas,
Acts		44	16	30	and after he brought them out, he said, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
Acts		44	16	31	They said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household."
Acts		44	16	32	And they spoke the word of the Lord to him together with all who were in his house.
Acts		44	16	33	And he took them that very hour of the night and washed their wounds, and immediately he was baptized, he and all his household.
Acts		44	16	34	And he brought them into his house and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, having believed in God with his whole household.
Acts		44	16	35	Now when day came, the chief magistrates sent their policemen, saying, "Release those men."
Acts		44	16	36	And the jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, "The chief magistrates have sent to release you. Therefore come out now and go in peace."
Acts		44	16	37	But Paul said to them, "They have beaten us in public without trial, men who are Romans, and have thrown us into prison; and now are they sending us away secretly? No indeed! But let them come themselves and bring us out."
Acts		44	16	38	The policemen reported these words to the chief magistrates. They were afraid when they heard that they were Romans,
Acts		44	16	39	and they came and appealed to them, and when they had brought them out, they kept begging them to leave the city.
Acts		44	16	40	They went out of the prison and entered the house of Lydia, and when they saw the brethren, they encouraged them and departed.
Acts		44	17	1	Now when they had traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.
Acts		44	17	2	And according to Paul's custom, he went to them, and for three Sabbaths reasoned with them from the Scriptures,
Acts		44	17	3	explaining and giving evidence that the Christ had to suffer and rise again from the dead, and saying, "This Jesus whom I am proclaiming to you is the Christ."
Acts		44	17	4	And some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, along with a large number of the God-fearing Greeks and a number of the leading women.
Acts		44	17	5	But the Jews, becoming jealous and taking along some wicked men from the market place, formed a mob and set the city in an uproar; and attacking the house of Jason, they were seeking to bring them out to the people.
Acts		44	17	6	When they did not find them, they began dragging Jason and some brethren before the city authorities, shouting, "These men who have upset the world have come here also;
Acts		44	17	7	and Jason has welcomed them, and they all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus."
Acts		44	17	8	They stirred up the crowd and the city authorities who heard these things.
Acts		44	17	9	And when they had received a pledge from Jason and the others, they released them.
Acts		44	17	10	The brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea, and when they arrived, they went into the synagogue of the Jews.
Acts		44	17	11	Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with great eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.
Acts		44	17	12	Therefore many of them believed, along with a number of prominent Greek women and men.
Acts		44	17	13	But when the Jews of Thessalonica found out that the word of God had been proclaimed by Paul in Berea also, they came there as well, agitating and stirring up the crowds.
Acts		44	17	14	Then immediately the brethren sent Paul out to go as far as the sea; and Silas and Timothy remained there.
Acts		44	17	15	Now those who escorted Paul brought him as far as Athens; and receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they left.
Acts		44	17	16	Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was being provoked within him as he was observing the city full of idols.
Acts		44	17	17	So he was reasoning in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing Gentiles, and in the market place every day with those who happened to be present.
Acts		44	17	18	And also some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers were conversing with him. Some were saying, "What would this idle babbler wish to say?" Others, "He seems to be a proclaimer of strange deities,"--because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection.
Acts		44	17	19	And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, "May we know what this new teaching is which you are proclaiming?
Acts		44	17	20	"For you are bringing some strange things to our ears; so we want to know what these things mean."
Acts		44	17	21	(Now all the Athenians and the strangers visiting there used to spend their time in nothing other than telling or hearing something new.)
Acts		44	17	22	So Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, "Men of Athens, I observe that you are very religious in all respects.
Acts		44	17	23	"For while I was passing through and examining the objects of your worship, I also found an altar with this inscription, 'TO AN UNKNOWN GOD.' Therefore what you worship in ignorance, this I proclaim to you.
Acts		44	17	24	"The God who made the world and all things in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands;
Acts		44	17	25	nor is He served by human hands, as though He needed anything, since He Himself gives to all people life and breath and all things;
Acts		44	17	26	and He made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their habitation,
Acts		44	17	27	that they would seek God, if perhaps they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us;
Acts		44	17	28	for in Him we live and move and exist, as even some of your own poets have said, 'For we also are His children.'
Acts		44	17	29	"Being then the children of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and thought of man.
Acts		44	17	30	"Therefore having overlooked the times of ignorance, God is now declaring to men that all people everywhere should repent,
Acts		44	17	31	because He has fixed a day in which He will judge the world in righteousness through a Man whom He has appointed, having furnished proof to all men by raising Him from the dead."
Acts		44	17	32	Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some began to sneer, but others said, "We shall hear you again concerning this."
Acts		44	17	33	So Paul went out of their midst.
Acts		44	17	34	But some men joined him and believed, among whom also were Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them.
Acts		44	18	1	After these things he left Athens and went to Corinth.
Acts		44	18	2	And he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, having recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome. He came to them,
Acts		44	18	3	and because he was of the same trade, he stayed with them and they were working, for by trade they were tent-makers.
Acts		44	18	4	And he was reasoning in the synagogue every Sabbath and trying to persuade Jews and Greeks.
Acts		44	18	5	But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul began devoting himself completely to the word, solemnly testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.
Acts		44	18	6	But when they resisted and blasphemed, he shook out his garments and said to them, "Your blood be on your own heads! I am clean. From now on I will go to the Gentiles."
Acts		44	18	7	Then he left there and went to the house of a man named Titius Justus, a worshiper of God, whose house was next to the synagogue.
Acts		44	18	8	Crispus, the leader of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his household, and many of the Corinthians when they heard were believing and being baptized.
Acts		44	18	9	And the Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision, "Do not be afraid any longer, but go on speaking and do not be silent;
Acts		44	18	10	for I am with you, and no man will attack you in order to harm you, for I have many people in this city."
Acts		44	18	11	And he settled there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.
Acts		44	18	12	But while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat,
Acts		44	18	13	saying, "This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law."
Acts		44	18	14	But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, "If it were a matter of wrong or of vicious crime, O Jews, it would be reasonable for me to put up with you;
Acts		44	18	15	but if there are questions about words and names and your own law, look after it yourselves; I am unwilling to be a judge of these matters."
Acts		44	18	16	And he drove them away from the judgment seat.
Acts		44	18	17	And they all took hold of Sosthenes, the leader of the synagogue, and began beating him in front of the judgment seat. But Gallio was not concerned about any of these things.
Acts		44	18	18	Paul, having remained many days longer, took leave of the brethren and put out to sea for Syria, and with him were Priscilla and Aquila. In Cenchrea he had his hair cut, for he was keeping a vow.
Acts		44	18	19	They came to Ephesus, and he left them there. Now he himself entered the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.
Acts		44	18	20	When they asked him to stay for a longer time, he did not consent,
Acts		44	18	21	but taking leave of them and saying, "I will return to you again if God wills," he set sail from Ephesus.
Acts		44	18	22	When he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church, and went down to Antioch.
Acts		44	18	23	And having spent some time there, he left and passed successively through the Galatian region and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.
Acts		44	18	24	Now a Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus; and he was mighty in the Scriptures.
Acts		44	18	25	This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he was speaking and teaching accurately the things concerning Jesus, being acquainted only with the baptism of John;
Acts		44	18	26	and he began to speak out boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately.
Acts		44	18	27	And when he wanted to go across to Achaia, the brethren encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him; and when he had arrived, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace,
Acts		44	18	28	for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public, demonstrating by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.
Acts		44	19	1	It happened that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the upper country and came to Ephesus, and found some disciples.
Acts		44	19	2	He said to them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?" And they said to him, "No, we have not even heard whether there is a Holy Spirit."
Acts		44	19	3	And he said, "Into what then were you baptized?" And they said, "Into John's baptism."
Acts		44	19	4	Paul said, "John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in Him who was coming after him, that is, in Jesus."
Acts		44	19	5	When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
Acts		44	19	6	And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they began speaking with tongues and prophesying.
Acts		44	19	7	There were in all about twelve men.
Acts		44	19	8	And he entered the synagogue and continued speaking out boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading them about the kingdom of God.
Acts		44	19	9	But when some were becoming hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the people, he withdrew from them and took away the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.
Acts		44	19	10	This took place for two years, so that all who lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.
Acts		44	19	11	God was performing extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul,
Acts		44	19	12	so that handkerchiefs or aprons were even carried from his body to the sick, and the diseases left them and the evil spirits went out.
Acts		44	19	13	But also some of the Jewish exorcists, who went from place to place, attempted to name over those who had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, "I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches."
Acts		44	19	14	Seven sons of one Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this.
Acts		44	19	15	And the evil spirit answered and said to them, "I recognize Jesus, and I know about Paul, but who are you?"
Acts		44	19	16	And the man, in whom was the evil spirit, leaped on them and subdued all of them and overpowered them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
Acts		44	19	17	This became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who lived in Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all and the name of the Lord Jesus was being magnified.
Acts		44	19	18	Many also of those who had believed kept coming, confessing and disclosing their practices.
Acts		44	19	19	And many of those who practiced magic brought their books together and began burning them in the sight of everyone; and they counted up the price of them and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.
Acts		44	19	20	So the word of the Lord was growing mightily and prevailing.
Acts		44	19	21	Now after these things were finished, Paul purposed in the Spirit to go to Jerusalem after he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, saying, "After I have been there, I must also see Rome."
Acts		44	19	22	And having sent into Macedonia two of those who ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.
Acts		44	19	23	About that time there occurred no small disturbance concerning the Way.
Acts		44	19	24	For a man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, was bringing no little business to the craftsmen;
Acts		44	19	25	these he gathered together with the workmen of similar trades, and said, "Men, you know that our prosperity depends upon this business.
Acts		44	19	26	"You see and hear that not only in Ephesus, but in almost all of Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away a considerable number of people, saying that gods made with hands are no gods at all.
Acts		44	19	27	"Not only is there danger that this trade of ours fall into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis be regarded as worthless and that she whom all of Asia and the world worship will even be dethroned from her magnificence."
Acts		44	19	28	When they heard this and were filled with rage, they began crying out, saying, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
Acts		44	19	29	The city was filled with the confusion, and they rushed with one accord into the theater, dragging along Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul's traveling companions from Macedonia.
Acts		44	19	30	And when Paul wanted to go into the assembly, the disciples would not let him.
Acts		44	19	31	Also some of the Asiarchs who were friends of his sent to him and repeatedly urged him not to venture into the theater.
Acts		44	19	32	So then, some were shouting one thing and some another, for the assembly was in confusion and the majority did not know for what reason they had come together.
Acts		44	19	33	Some of the crowd concluded it was Alexander, since the Jews had put him forward; and having motioned with his hand, Alexander was intending to make a defense to the assembly.
Acts		44	19	34	But when they recognized that he was a Jew, a single outcry arose from them all as they shouted for about two hours, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
Acts		44	19	35	After quieting the crowd, the town clerk *said, "Men of Ephesus, what man is there after all who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of the image which fell down from heaven?
Acts		44	19	36	"So, since these are undeniable facts, you ought to keep calm and to do nothing rash.
Acts		44	19	37	"For you have brought these men here who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess.
Acts		44	19	38	"So then, if Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a complaint against any man, the courts are in session and proconsuls are available; let them bring charges against one another.
Acts		44	19	39	"But if you want anything beyond this, it shall be settled in the lawful assembly.
Acts		44	19	40	"For indeed we are in danger of being accused of a riot in connection with today's events, since there is no real cause for it, and in this connection we will be unable to account for this disorderly gathering."
Acts		44	19	41	After saying this he dismissed the assembly.
Acts		44	20	1	After the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples, and when he had exhorted them and taken his leave of them, he left to go to Macedonia.
Acts		44	20	2	When he had gone through those districts and had given them much exhortation, he came to Greece.
Acts		44	20	3	And there he spent three months, and when a plot was formed against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia.
Acts		44	20	4	And he was accompanied by Sopater of Berea, the son of Pyrrhus, and by Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia.
Acts		44	20	5	But these had gone on ahead and were waiting for us at Troas.
Acts		44	20	6	We sailed from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and came to them at Troas within five days; and there we stayed seven days.
Acts		44	20	7	On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul began talking to them, intending to leave the next day, and he prolonged his message until midnight.
Acts		44	20	8	There were many lamps in the upper room where we were gathered together.
Acts		44	20	9	And there was a young man named Eutychus sitting on the window sill, sinking into a deep sleep; and as Paul kept on talking, he was overcome by sleep and fell down from the third floor and was picked up dead.
Acts		44	20	10	But Paul went down and fell upon him, and after embracing him, he said, "Do not be troubled, for his life is in him."
Acts		44	20	11	When he had gone back up and had broken the bread and eaten, he talked with them a long while until daybreak, and then left.
Acts		44	20	12	They took away the boy alive, and were greatly comforted.
Acts		44	20	13	But we, going ahead to the ship, set sail for Assos, intending from there to take Paul on board; for so he had arranged it, intending himself to go by land.
Acts		44	20	14	And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and came to Mitylene.
Acts		44	20	15	Sailing from there, we arrived the following day opposite Chios; and the next day we crossed over to Samos; and the day following we came to Miletus.
Acts		44	20	16	For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus so that he would not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hurrying to be in Jerusalem, if possible, on the day of Pentecost.
Acts		44	20	17	From Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called to him the elders of the church.
Acts		44	20	18	And when they had come to him, he said to them, "You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I was with you the whole time,
Acts		44	20	19	serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials which came upon me through the plots of the Jews;
Acts		44	20	20	how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and teaching you publicly and from house to house,
Acts		44	20	21	solemnly testifying to both Jews and Greeks of repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.
Acts		44	20	22	"And now, behold, bound by the Spirit, I am on my way to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there,
Acts		44	20	23	except that the Holy Spirit solemnly testifies to me in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me.
Acts		44	20	24	"But I do not consider my life of any account as dear to myself, so that I may finish my course and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify solemnly of the gospel of the grace of God.
Acts		44	20	25	"And now, behold, I know that all of you, among whom I went about preaching the kingdom, will no longer see my face.
Acts		44	20	26	"Therefore, I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all men.
Acts		44	20	27	"For I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole purpose of God.
Acts		44	20	28	"Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood.
Acts		44	20	29	"I know that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock;
Acts		44	20	30	and from among your own selves men will arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them.
Acts		44	20	31	"Therefore be on the alert, remembering that night and day for a period of three years I did not cease to admonish each one with tears.
Acts		44	20	32	"And now I commend you to God and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified.
Acts		44	20	33	"I have coveted no one's silver or gold or clothes.
Acts		44	20	34	"You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my own needs and to the men who were with me.
Acts		44	20	35	"In everything I showed you that by working hard in this manner you must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He Himself said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'"
Acts		44	20	36	When he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all.
Acts		44	20	37	And they began to weep aloud and embraced Paul, and repeatedly kissed him,
Acts		44	20	38	grieving especially over the word which he had spoken, that they would not see his face again. And they were accompanying him to the ship.
Acts		44	21	1	When we had parted from them and had set sail, we ran a straight course to Cos and the next day to Rhodes and from there to Patara;
Acts		44	21	2	and having found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard and set sail.
Acts		44	21	3	When we came in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left, we kept sailing to Syria and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to unload its cargo.
Acts		44	21	4	After looking up the disciples, we stayed there seven days; and they kept telling Paul through the Spirit not to set foot in Jerusalem.
Acts		44	21	5	When our days there were ended, we left and started on our journey, while they all, with wives and children, escorted us until we were out of the city. After kneeling down on the beach and praying, we said farewell to one another.
Acts		44	21	6	Then we went on board the ship, and they returned home again.
Acts		44	21	7	When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais, and after greeting the brethren, we stayed with them for a day.
Acts		44	21	8	On the next day we left and came to Caesarea, and entering the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we stayed with him.
Acts		44	21	9	Now this man had four virgin daughters who were prophetesses.
Acts		44	21	10	As we were staying there for some days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.
Acts		44	21	11	And coming to us, he took Paul's belt and bound his own feet and hands, and said, "This is what the Holy Spirit says: 'In this way the Jews at Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.'"
Acts		44	21	12	When we had heard this, we as well as the local residents began begging him not to go up to Jerusalem.
Acts		44	21	13	Then Paul answered, "What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but even to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."
Acts		44	21	14	And since he would not be persuaded, we fell silent, remarking, "The will of the Lord be done!"
Acts		44	21	15	After these days we got ready and started on our way up to Jerusalem.
Acts		44	21	16	Some of the disciples from Caesarea also came with us, taking us to Mnason of Cyprus, a disciple of long standing with whom we were to lodge.
Acts		44	21	17	After we arrived in Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.
Acts		44	21	18	And the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.
Acts		44	21	19	After he had greeted them, he began to relate one by one the things which God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.
Acts		44	21	20	And when they heard it they began glorifying God; and they said to him, "You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed, and they are all zealous for the Law;
Acts		44	21	21	and they have been told about you, that you are teaching all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children nor to walk according to the customs.
Acts		44	21	22	"What, then, is to be done? They will certainly hear that you have come.
Acts		44	21	23	"Therefore do this that we tell you. We have four men who are under a vow;
Acts		44	21	24	take them and purify yourself along with them, and pay their expenses so that they may shave their heads; and all will know that there is nothing to the things which they have been told about you, but that you yourself also walk orderly, keeping the Law.
Acts		44	21	25	"But concerning the Gentiles who have believed, we wrote, having decided that they should abstain from meat sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from fornication."
Acts		44	21	26	Then Paul took the men, and the next day, purifying himself along with them, went into the temple giving notice of the completion of the days of purification, until the sacrifice was offered for each one of them.
Acts		44	21	27	When the seven days were almost over, the Jews from Asia, upon seeing him in the temple, began to stir up all the crowd and laid hands on him,
Acts		44	21	28	crying out, "Men of Israel, come to our aid! This is the man who preaches to all men everywhere against our people and the Law and this place; and besides he has even brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place."
Acts		44	21	29	For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple.
Acts		44	21	30	Then all the city was provoked, and the people rushed together, and taking hold of Paul they dragged him out of the temple, and immediately the doors were shut.
Acts		44	21	31	While they were seeking to kill him, a report came up to the commander of the Roman cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion.
Acts		44	21	32	At once he took along some soldiers and centurions and ran down to them; and when they saw the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.
Acts		44	21	33	Then the commander came up and took hold of him, and ordered him to be bound with two chains; and he began asking who he was and what he had done.
Acts		44	21	34	But among the crowd some were shouting one thing and some another, and when he could not find out the facts because of the uproar, he ordered him to be brought into the barracks.
Acts		44	21	35	When he got to the stairs, he was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob;
Acts		44	21	36	for the multitude of the people kept following them, shouting, "Away with him!"
Acts		44	21	37	As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said to the commander, "May I say something to you?" And he *said, "Do you know Greek?
Acts		44	21	38	"Then you are not the Egyptian who some time ago stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand men of the Assassins out into the wilderness?"
Acts		44	21	39	But Paul said, "I am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city; and I beg you, allow me to speak to the people."
Acts		44	21	40	When he had given him permission, Paul, standing on the stairs, motioned to the people with his hand; and when there was a great hush, he spoke to them in the Hebrew dialect, saying,
Acts		44	22	1	"Brethren and fathers, hear my defense which I now offer to you."
Acts		44	22	2	And when they heard that he was addressing them in the Hebrew dialect, they became even more quiet; and he *said,
Acts		44	22	3	"I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated under Gamaliel, strictly according to the law of our fathers, being zealous for God just as you all are today.
Acts		44	22	4	"I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and putting both men and women into prisons,
Acts		44	22	5	as also the high priest and all the Council of the elders can testify. From them I also received letters to the brethren, and started off for Damascus in order to bring even those who were there to Jerusalem as prisoners to be punished.
Acts		44	22	6	"But it happened that as I was on my way, approaching Damascus about noontime, a very bright light suddenly flashed from heaven all around me,
Acts		44	22	7	and I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?'
Acts		44	22	8	"And I answered, 'Who are You, Lord?' And He said to me, 'I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you are persecuting.'
Acts		44	22	9	"And those who were with me saw the light, to be sure, but did not understand the voice of the One who was speaking to me.
Acts		44	22	10	"And I said, 'What shall I do, Lord?' And the Lord said to me, 'Get up and go on into Damascus, and there you will be told of all that has been appointed for you to do.'
Acts		44	22	11	"But since I could not see because of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me and came into Damascus.
Acts		44	22	12	"A certain Ananias, a man who was devout by the standard of the Law, and well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there,
Acts		44	22	13	came to me, and standing near said to me, 'Brother Saul, receive your sight!' And at that very time I looked up at him.
Acts		44	22	14	"And he said, 'The God of our fathers has appointed you to know His will and to see the Righteous One and to hear an utterance from His mouth.
Acts		44	22	15	'For you will be a witness for Him to all men of what you have seen and heard.
Acts		44	22	16	'Now why do you delay? Get up and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on His name.'
Acts		44	22	17	"It happened when I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, that I fell into a trance,
Acts		44	22	18	and I saw Him saying to me, 'Make haste, and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about Me.'
Acts		44	22	19	"And I said, 'Lord, they themselves understand that in one synagogue after another I used to imprison and beat those who believed in You.
Acts		44	22	20	'And when the blood of Your witness Stephen was being shed, I also was standing by approving, and watching out for the coats of those who were slaying him.'
Acts		44	22	21	"And He said to me, 'Go! For I will send you far away to the Gentiles.'"
Acts		44	22	22	They listened to him up to this statement, and then they raised their voices and said, "Away with such a fellow from the earth, for he should not be allowed to live!"
Acts		44	22	23	And as they were crying out and throwing off their cloaks and tossing dust into the air,
Acts		44	22	24	the commander ordered him to be brought into the barracks, stating that he should be examined by scourging so that he might find out the reason why they were shouting against him that way.
Acts		44	22	25	But when they stretched him out with thongs, Paul said to the centurion who was standing by, "Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman and uncondemned?"
Acts		44	22	26	When the centurion heard this, he went to the commander and told him, saying, "What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman."
Acts		44	22	27	The commander came and said to him, "Tell me, are you a Roman?" And he said, "Yes."
Acts		44	22	28	The commander answered, "I acquired this citizenship with a large sum of money." And Paul said, "But I was actually born a citizen."
Acts		44	22	29	Therefore those who were about to examine him immediately let go of him; and the commander also was afraid when he found out that he was a Roman, and because he had put him in chains.
Acts		44	22	30	But on the next day, wishing to know for certain why he had been accused by the Jews, he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the Council to assemble, and brought Paul down and set him before them.
Acts		44	23	1	Paul, looking intently at the Council, said, "Brethren, I have lived my life with a perfectly good conscience before God up to this day."
Acts		44	23	2	The high priest Ananias commanded those standing beside him to strike him on the mouth.
Acts		44	23	3	Then Paul said to him, "God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall! Do you sit to try me according to the Law, and in violation of the Law order me to be struck?"
Acts		44	23	4	But the bystanders said, "Do you revile God's high priest?"
Acts		44	23	5	And Paul said, "I was not aware, brethren, that he was high priest; for it is written, 'YOU SHALL NOT SPEAK EVIL OF A RULER OF YOUR PEOPLE.'"
Acts		44	23	6	But perceiving that one group were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, Paul began crying out in the Council, "Brethren, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees; I am on trial for the hope and resurrection of the dead!"
Acts		44	23	7	As he said this, there occurred a dissension between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.
Acts		44	23	8	For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor an angel, nor a spirit, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all.
Acts		44	23	9	And there occurred a great uproar; and some of the scribes of the Pharisaic party stood up and began to argue heatedly, saying, "We find nothing wrong with this man; suppose a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?"
Acts		44	23	10	And as a great dissension was developing, the commander was afraid Paul would be torn to pieces by them and ordered the troops to go down and take him away from them by force, and bring him into the barracks.
Acts		44	23	11	But on the night immediately following, the Lord stood at his side and said, "Take courage; for as you have solemnly witnessed to My cause at Jerusalem, so you must witness at Rome also."
Acts		44	23	12	When it was day, the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves under an oath, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.
Acts		44	23	13	There were more than forty who formed this plot.
Acts		44	23	14	They came to the chief priests and the elders and said, "We have bound ourselves under a solemn oath to taste nothing until we have killed Paul.
Acts		44	23	15	"Now therefore, you and the Council notify the commander to bring him down to you, as though you were going to determine his case by a more thorough investigation; and we for our part are ready to slay him before he comes near the place."
Acts		44	23	16	But the son of Paul's sister heard of their ambush, and he came and entered the barracks and told Paul.
Acts		44	23	17	Paul called one of the centurions to him and said, "Lead this young man to the commander, for he has something to report to him."
Acts		44	23	18	So he took him and led him to the commander and *said, "Paul the prisoner called me to him and asked me to lead this young man to you since he has something to tell you."
Acts		44	23	19	The commander took him by the hand and stepping aside, began to inquire of him privately, "What is it that you have to report to me?"
Acts		44	23	20	And he said, "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down tomorrow to the Council, as though they were going to inquire somewhat more thoroughly about him.
Acts		44	23	21	"So do not listen to them, for more than forty of them are lying in wait for him who have bound themselves under a curse not to eat or drink until they slay him; and now they are ready and waiting for the promise from you."
Acts		44	23	22	So the commander let the young man go, instructing him, "Tell no one that you have notified me of these things."
Acts		44	23	23	And he called to him two of the centurions and said, "Get two hundred soldiers ready by the third hour of the night to proceed to Caesarea, with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen."
Acts		44	23	24	They were also to provide mounts to put Paul on and bring him safely to Felix the governor.
Acts		44	23	25	And he wrote a letter having this form:
Acts		44	23	26	"Claudius Lysias, to the most excellent governor Felix, greetings.
Acts		44	23	27	"When this man was arrested by the Jews and was about to be slain by them, I came up to them with the troops and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.
Acts		44	23	28	"And wanting to ascertain the charge for which they were accusing him, I brought him down to their Council;
Acts		44	23	29	and I found him to be accused over questions about their Law, but under no accusation deserving death or imprisonment.
Acts		44	23	30	"When I was informed that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to you at once, also instructing his accusers to bring charges against him before you."
Acts		44	23	31	So the soldiers, in accordance with their orders, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.
Acts		44	23	32	But the next day, leaving the horsemen to go on with him, they returned to the barracks.
Acts		44	23	33	When these had come to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him.
Acts		44	23	34	When he had read it, he asked from what province he was, and when he learned that he was from Cilicia,
Acts		44	23	35	he said, "I will give you a hearing after your accusers arrive also," giving orders for him to be kept in Herod's Praetorium.
Acts		44	24	1	After five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders, with an attorney named Tertullus, and they brought charges to the governor against Paul.
Acts		44	24	2	After Paul had been summoned, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying to the governor, "Since we have through you attained much peace, and since by your providence reforms are being carried out for this nation,
Acts		44	24	3	we acknowledge this in every way and everywhere, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.
Acts		44	24	4	"But, that I may not weary you any further, I beg you to grant us, by your kindness, a brief hearing.
Acts		44	24	5	"For we have found this man a real pest and a fellow who stirs up dissension among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.
Acts		44	24	6	"And he even tried to desecrate the temple; and then we arrested him. [We wanted to judge him according to our own Law.
Acts		44	24	7	"But Lysias the commander came along, and with much violence took him out of our hands,
Acts		44	24	8	ordering his accusers to come before you.] By examining him yourself concerning all these matters you will be able to ascertain the things of which we accuse him."
Acts		44	24	9	The Jews also joined in the attack, asserting that these things were so.
Acts		44	24	10	When the governor had nodded for him to speak, Paul responded: "Knowing that for many years you have been a judge to this nation, I cheerfully make my defense,
Acts		44	24	11	since you can take note of the fact that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship.
Acts		44	24	12	"Neither in the temple, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city itself did they find me carrying on a discussion with anyone or causing a riot.
Acts		44	24	13	"Nor can they prove to you the charges of which they now accuse me.
Acts		44	24	14	"But this I admit to you, that according to the Way which they call a sect I do serve the God of our fathers, believing everything that is in accordance with the Law and that is written in the Prophets;
Acts		44	24	15	having a hope in God, which these men cherish themselves, that there shall certainly be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked.
Acts		44	24	16	"In view of this, I also do my best to maintain always a blameless conscience both before God and before men.
Acts		44	24	17	"Now after several years I came to bring alms to my nation and to present offerings;
Acts		44	24	18	in which they found me occupied in the temple, having been purified, without any crowd or uproar. But there were some Jews from Asia--
Acts		44	24	19	who ought to have been present before you and to make accusation, if they should have anything against me.
Acts		44	24	20	"Or else let these men themselves tell what misdeed they found when I stood before the Council,
Acts		44	24	21	other than for this one statement which I shouted out while standing among them, 'For the resurrection of the dead I am on trial before you today.'"
Acts		44	24	22	But Felix, having a more exact knowledge about the Way, put them off, saying, "When Lysias the commander comes down, I will decide your case."
Acts		44	24	23	Then he gave orders to the centurion for him to be kept in custody and yet have some freedom, and not to prevent any of his friends from ministering to him.
Acts		44	24	24	But some days later Felix arrived with Drusilla, his wife who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul and heard him speak about faith in Christ Jesus.
Acts		44	24	25	But as he was discussing righteousness, self-control and the judgment to come, Felix became frightened and said, "Go away for the present, and when I find time I will summon you."
Acts		44	24	26	At the same time too, he was hoping that money would be given him by Paul; therefore he also used to send for him quite often and converse with him.
Acts		44	24	27	But after two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, and wishing to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul imprisoned.
Acts		44	25	1	Festus then, having arrived in the province, three days later went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.
Acts		44	25	2	And the chief priests and the leading men of the Jews brought charges against Paul, and they were urging him,
Acts		44	25	3	requesting a concession against Paul, that he might have him brought to Jerusalem (at the same time, setting an ambush to kill him on the way).
Acts		44	25	4	Festus then answered that Paul was being kept in custody at Caesarea and that he himself was about to leave shortly.
Acts		44	25	5	"Therefore," he *said, "let the influential men among you go there with me, and if there is anything wrong about the man, let them prosecute him."
Acts		44	25	6	After he had spent not more than eight or ten days among them, he went down to Caesarea, and on the next day he took his seat on the tribunal and ordered Paul to be brought.
Acts		44	25	7	After Paul arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many and serious charges against him which they could not prove,
Acts		44	25	8	while Paul said in his own defense, "I have committed no offense either against the Law of the Jews or against the temple or against Caesar."
Acts		44	25	9	But Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, answered Paul and said, "Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and stand trial before me on these charges?"
Acts		44	25	10	But Paul said, "I am standing before Caesar's tribunal, where I ought to be tried. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you also very well know.
Acts		44	25	11	"If, then, I am a wrongdoer and have committed anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die; but if none of those things is true of which these men accuse me, no one can hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar."
Acts		44	25	12	Then when Festus had conferred with his council, he answered, "You have appealed to Caesar, to Caesar you shall go."
Acts		44	25	13	Now when several days had elapsed, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea and paid their respects to Festus.
Acts		44	25	14	While they were spending many days there, Festus laid Paul's case before the king, saying, "There is a man who was left as a prisoner by Felix;
Acts		44	25	15	and when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews brought charges against him, asking for a sentence of condemnation against him.
Acts		44	25	16	"I answered them that it is not the custom of the Romans to hand over any man before the accused meets his accusers face to face and has an opportunity to make his defense against the charges.
Acts		44	25	17	"So after they had assembled here, I did not delay, but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought before me.
Acts		44	25	18	"When the accusers stood up, they began bringing charges against him not of such crimes as I was expecting,
Acts		44	25	19	but they simply had some points of disagreement with him about their own religion and about a dead man, Jesus, whom Paul asserted to be alive.
Acts		44	25	20	"Being at a loss how to investigate such matters, I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and there stand trial on these matters.
Acts		44	25	21	"But when Paul appealed to be held in custody for the Emperor's decision, I ordered him to be kept in custody until I send him to Caesar."
Acts		44	25	22	Then Agrippa said to Festus, "I also would like to hear the man myself." "Tomorrow," he *said, "you shall hear him."
Acts		44	25	23	So, on the next day when Agrippa came together with Bernice amid great pomp, and entered the auditorium accompanied by the commanders and the prominent men of the city, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.
Acts		44	25	24	Festus *said, "King Agrippa, and all you gentlemen here present with us, you see this man about whom all the people of the Jews appealed to me, both at Jerusalem and here, loudly declaring that he ought not to live any longer.
Acts		44	25	25	"But I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death; and since he himself appealed to the Emperor, I decided to send him.
Acts		44	25	26	"Yet I have nothing definite about him to write to my lord. Therefore I have brought him before you all and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after the investigation has taken place, I may have something to write.
Acts		44	25	27	"For it seems absurd to me in sending a prisoner, not to indicate also the charges against him."
Acts		44	26	1	Agrippa said to Paul, "You are permitted to speak for yourself." Then Paul stretched out his hand and proceeded to make his defense:
Acts		44	26	2	"In regard to all the things of which I am accused by the Jews, I consider myself fortunate, King Agrippa, that I am about to make my defense before you today;
Acts		44	26	3	especially because you are an expert in all customs and questions among the Jews; therefore I beg you to listen to me patiently.
Acts		44	26	4	"So then, all Jews know my manner of life from my youth up, which from the beginning was spent among my own nation and at Jerusalem;
Acts		44	26	5	since they have known about me for a long time, if they are willing to testify, that I lived as a Pharisee according to the strictest sect of our religion.
Acts		44	26	6	"And now I am standing trial for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers;
Acts		44	26	7	the promise to which our twelve tribes hope to attain, as they earnestly serve God night and day. And for this hope, O King, I am being accused by Jews.
Acts		44	26	8	"Why is it considered incredible among you people if God does raise the dead?
Acts		44	26	9	"So then, I thought to myself that I had to do many things hostile to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
Acts		44	26	10	"And this is just what I did in Jerusalem; not only did I lock up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests, but also when they were being put to death I cast my vote against them.
Acts		44	26	11	"And as I punished them often in all the synagogues, I tried to force them to blaspheme; and being furiously enraged at them, I kept pursuing them even to foreign cities.
Acts		44	26	12	"While so engaged as I was journeying to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests,
Acts		44	26	13	at midday, O King, I saw on the way a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining all around me and those who were journeying with me.
Acts		44	26	14	"And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew dialect, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.'
Acts		44	26	15	"And I said, 'Who are You, Lord?' And the Lord said, 'I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.
Acts		44	26	16	'But get up and stand on your feet; for this purpose I have appeared to you, to appoint you a minister and a witness not only to the things which you have seen, but also to the things in which I will appear to you;
Acts		44	26	17	rescuing you from the Jewish people and from the Gentiles, to whom I am sending you,
Acts		44	26	18	to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the dominion of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in Me.'
Acts		44	26	19	"So, King Agrippa, I did not prove disobedient to the heavenly vision,
Acts		44	26	20	but kept declaring both to those of Damascus first, and also at Jerusalem and then throughout all the region of Judea, and even to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, performing deeds appropriate to repentance.
Acts		44	26	21	"For this reason some Jews seized me in the temple and tried to put me to death.
Acts		44	26	22	"So, having obtained help from God, I stand to this day testifying both to small and great, stating nothing but what the Prophets and Moses said was going to take place;
Acts		44	26	23	that the Christ was to suffer, and that by reason of His resurrection from the dead He would be the first to proclaim light both to the Jewish people and to the Gentiles."
Acts		44	26	24	While Paul was saying this in his defense, Festus *said in a loud voice, "Paul, you are out of your mind! Your great learning is driving you mad."
Acts		44	26	25	But Paul *said, "I am not out of my mind, most excellent Festus, but I utter words of sober truth.
Acts		44	26	26	"For the king knows about these matters, and I speak to him also with confidence, since I am persuaded that none of these things escape his notice; for this has not been done in a corner.
Acts		44	26	27	"King Agrippa, do you believe the Prophets? I know that you do."
Acts		44	26	28	Agrippa replied to Paul, "In a short time you will persuade me to become a Christian."
Acts		44	26	29	And Paul said, "I would wish to God, that whether in a short or long time, not only you, but also all who hear me this day, might become such as I am, except for these chains."
Acts		44	26	30	The king stood up and the governor and Bernice, and those who were sitting with them,
Acts		44	26	31	and when they had gone aside, they began talking to one another, saying, "This man is not doing anything worthy of death or imprisonment."
Acts		44	26	32	And Agrippa said to Festus, "This man might have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar."
Acts		44	27	1	When it was decided that we would sail for Italy, they proceeded to deliver Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the Augustan cohort named Julius.
Acts		44	27	2	And embarking in an Adramyttian ship, which was about to sail to the regions along the coast of Asia, we put out to sea accompanied by Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica.
Acts		44	27	3	The next day we put in at Sidon; and Julius treated Paul with consideration and allowed him to go to his friends and receive care.
Acts		44	27	4	From there we put out to sea and sailed under the shelter of Cyprus because the winds were contrary.
Acts		44	27	5	When we had sailed through the sea along the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we landed at Myra in Lycia.
Acts		44	27	6	There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy, and he put us aboard it.
Acts		44	27	7	When we had sailed slowly for a good many days, and with difficulty had arrived off Cnidus, since the wind did not permit us to go farther, we sailed under the shelter of Crete, off Salmone;
Acts		44	27	8	and with difficulty sailing past it we came to a place called Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lasea.
Acts		44	27	9	When considerable time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous, since even the fast was already over, Paul began to admonish them,
Acts		44	27	10	and said to them, "Men, I perceive that the voyage will certainly be with damage and great loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives."
Acts		44	27	11	But the centurion was more persuaded by the pilot and the captain of the ship than by what was being said by Paul.
Acts		44	27	12	Because the harbor was not suitable for wintering, the majority reached a decision to put out to sea from there, if somehow they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete, facing southwest and northwest, and spend the winter there.
Acts		44	27	13	When a moderate south wind came up, supposing that they had attained their purpose, they weighed anchor and began sailing along Crete, close inshore.
Acts		44	27	14	But before very long there rushed down from the land a violent wind, called Euraquilo;
Acts		44	27	15	and when the ship was caught in it and could not face the wind, we gave way to it and let ourselves be driven along.
Acts		44	27	16	Running under the shelter of a small island called Clauda, we were scarcely able to get the ship's boat under control.
Acts		44	27	17	After they had hoisted it up, they used supporting cables in undergirding the ship; and fearing that they might run aground on the shallows of Syrtis, they let down the sea anchor and in this way let themselves be driven along.
Acts		44	27	18	The next day as we were being violently storm-tossed, they began to jettison the cargo;
Acts		44	27	19	and on the third day they threw the ship's tackle overboard with their own hands.
Acts		44	27	20	Since neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small storm was assailing us, from then on all hope of our being saved was gradually abandoned.
Acts		44	27	21	When they had gone a long time without food, then Paul stood up in their midst and said, "Men, you ought to have followed my advice and not to have set sail from Crete and incurred this damage and loss.
Acts		44	27	22	"Yet now I urge you to keep up your courage, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.
Acts		44	27	23	"For this very night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve stood before me,
Acts		44	27	24	saying, 'Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before Caesar; and behold, God has granted you all those who are sailing with you.'
Acts		44	27	25	"Therefore, keep up your courage, men, for I believe God that it will turn out exactly as I have been told.
Acts		44	27	26	"But we must run aground on a certain island."
Acts		44	27	27	But when the fourteenth night came, as we were being driven about in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors began to surmise that they were approaching some land.
Acts		44	27	28	They took soundings and found it to be twenty fathoms; and a little farther on they took another sounding and found it to be fifteen fathoms.
Acts		44	27	29	Fearing that we might run aground somewhere on the rocks, they cast four anchors from the stern and wished for daybreak.
Acts		44	27	30	But as the sailors were trying to escape from the ship and had let down the ship's boat into the sea, on the pretense of intending to lay out anchors from the bow,
Acts		44	27	31	Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, "Unless these men remain in the ship, you yourselves cannot be saved."
Acts		44	27	32	Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the ship's boat and let it fall away.
Acts		44	27	33	Until the day was about to dawn, Paul was encouraging them all to take some food, saying, "Today is the fourteenth day that you have been constantly watching and going without eating, having taken nothing.
Acts		44	27	34	"Therefore I encourage you to take some food, for this is for your preservation, for not a hair from the head of any of you will perish."
Acts		44	27	35	Having said this, he took bread and gave thanks to God in the presence of all, and he broke it and began to eat.
Acts		44	27	36	All of them were encouraged and they themselves also took food.
Acts		44	27	37	All of us in the ship were two hundred and seventy-six persons.
Acts		44	27	38	When they had eaten enough, they began to lighten the ship by throwing out the wheat into the sea.
Acts		44	27	39	When day came, they could not recognize the land; but they did observe a bay with a beach, and they resolved to drive the ship onto it if they could.
Acts		44	27	40	And casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea while at the same time they were loosening the ropes of the rudders; and hoisting the foresail to the wind, they were heading for the beach.
Acts		44	27	41	But striking a reef where two seas met, they ran the vessel aground; and the prow stuck fast and remained immovable, but the stern began to be broken up by the force of the waves.
Acts		44	27	42	The soldiers' plan was to kill the prisoners, so that none of them would swim away and escape;
Acts		44	27	43	but the centurion, wanting to bring Paul safely through, kept them from their intention, and commanded that those who could swim should jump overboard first and get to land,
Acts		44	27	44	and the rest should follow, some on planks, and others on various things from the ship. And so it happened that they all were brought safely to land.
Acts		44	28	1	When they had been brought safely through, then we found out that the island was called Malta.
Acts		44	28	2	The natives showed us extraordinary kindness; for because of the rain that had set in and because of the cold, they kindled a fire and received us all.
Acts		44	28	3	But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and fastened itself on his hand.
Acts		44	28	4	When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they began saying to one another, "Undoubtedly this man is a murderer, and though he has been saved from the sea, justice has not allowed him to live."
Acts		44	28	5	However he shook the creature off into the fire and suffered no harm.
Acts		44	28	6	But they were expecting that he was about to swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But after they had waited a long time and had seen nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and began to say that he was a god.
Acts		44	28	7	Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the leading man of the island, named Publius, who welcomed us and entertained us courteously three days.
Acts		44	28	8	And it happened that the father of Publius was lying in bed afflicted with recurrent fever and dysentery; and Paul went in to see him and after he had prayed, he laid his hands on him and healed him.
Acts		44	28	9	After this had happened, the rest of the people on the island who had diseases were coming to him and getting cured.
Acts		44	28	10	They also honored us with many marks of respect; and when we were setting sail, they supplied us with all we needed.
Acts		44	28	11	At the end of three months we set sail on an Alexandrian ship which had wintered at the island, and which had the Twin Brothers for its figurehead.
Acts		44	28	12	After we put in at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days.
Acts		44	28	13	From there we sailed around and arrived at Rhegium, and a day later a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli.
Acts		44	28	14	There we found some brethren, and were invited to stay with them for seven days; and thus we came to Rome.
Acts		44	28	15	And the brethren, when they heard about us, came from there as far as the Market of Appius and Three Inns to meet us; and when Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage.
Acts		44	28	16	When we entered Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself, with the soldier who was guarding him.
Acts		44	28	17	After three days Paul called together those who were the leading men of the Jews, and when they came together, he began saying to them, "Brethren, though I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
Acts		44	28	18	"And when they had examined me, they were willing to release me because there was no ground for putting me to death.
Acts		44	28	19	"But when the Jews objected, I was forced to appeal to Caesar, not that I had any accusation against my nation.
Acts		44	28	20	"For this reason, therefore, I requested to see you and to speak with you, for I am wearing this chain for the sake of the hope of Israel."
Acts		44	28	21	They said to him, "We have neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor have any of the brethren come here and reported or spoken anything bad about you.
Acts		44	28	22	"But we desire to hear from you what your views are; for concerning this sect, it is known to us that it is spoken against everywhere."
Acts		44	28	23	When they had set a day for Paul, they came to him at his lodging in large numbers; and he was explaining to them by solemnly testifying about the kingdom of God and trying to persuade them concerning Jesus, from both the Law of Moses and from the Prophets, from morning until evening.
Acts		44	28	24	Some were being persuaded by the things spoken, but others would not believe.
Acts		44	28	25	And when they did not agree with one another, they began leaving after Paul had spoken one parting word, "The Holy Spirit rightly spoke through Isaiah the prophet to your fathers,
Acts		44	28	26	saying, 'GO TO THIS PEOPLE AND SAY, "YOU WILL KEEP ON HEARING, BUT WILL NOT UNDERSTAND; AND YOU WILL KEEP ON SEEING, BUT WILL NOT PERCEIVE;
Acts		44	28	27	FOR THE HEART OF THIS PEOPLE HAS BECOME DULL, AND WITH THEIR EARS THEY SCARCELY HEAR, AND THEY HAVE CLOSED THEIR EYES; OTHERWISE THEY MIGHT SEE WITH THEIR EYES, AND HEAR WITH THEIR EARS, AND UNDERSTAND WITH THEIR HEART AND RETURN, AND I WOULD HEAL THEM."'
Acts		44	28	28	"Therefore let it be known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles; they will also listen."
Acts		44	28	29	[When he had spoken these words, the Jews departed, having a great dispute among themselves.]
Acts		44	28	30	And he stayed two full years in his own rented quarters and was welcoming all who came to him,
Acts		44	28	31	preaching the kingdom of God and teaching concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all openness, unhindered.
Romans	Rom	45	1	1	Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,
Romans	Rom	45	1	2	which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures,
Romans	Rom	45	1	3	concerning His Son, who was born of a descendant of David according to the flesh,
Romans	Rom	45	1	4	who was declared the Son of God with power by the resurrection from the dead, according to the Spirit of holiness, Jesus Christ our Lord,
Romans	Rom	45	1	5	through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles for His name's sake,
Romans	Rom	45	1	6	among whom you also are the called of Jesus Christ;
Romans	Rom	45	1	7	to all who are beloved of God in Rome, called as saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Romans	Rom	45	1	8	First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, because your faith is being proclaimed throughout the whole world.
Romans	Rom	45	1	9	For God, whom I serve in my spirit in the preaching of the gospel of His Son, is my witness as to how unceasingly I make mention of you,
Romans	Rom	45	1	10	always in my prayers making request, if perhaps now at last by the will of God I may succeed in coming to you.
Romans	Rom	45	1	11	For I long to see you so that I may impart some spiritual gift to you, that you may be established;
Romans	Rom	45	1	12	that is, that I may be encouraged together with you while among you, each of us by the other's faith, both yours and mine.
Romans	Rom	45	1	13	I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that often I have planned to come to you (and have been prevented so far) so that I may obtain some fruit among you also, even as among the rest of the Gentiles.
Romans	Rom	45	1	14	I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish.
Romans	Rom	45	1	15	So, for my part, I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.
Romans	Rom	45	1	16	For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.
Romans	Rom	45	1	17	For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, "BUT THE RIGHTEOUS man SHALL LIVE BY FAITH."
Romans	Rom	45	1	18	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness,
Romans	Rom	45	1	19	because that which is known about God is evident within them; for God made it evident to them.
Romans	Rom	45	1	20	For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse.
Romans	Rom	45	1	21	For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened.
Romans	Rom	45	1	22	Professing to be wise, they became fools,
Romans	Rom	45	1	23	and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and crawling creatures.
Romans	Rom	45	1	24	Therefore God gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, so that their bodies would be dishonored among them.
Romans	Rom	45	1	25	For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.
Romans	Rom	45	1	26	For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural,
Romans	Rom	45	1	27	and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error.
Romans	Rom	45	1	28	And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper,
Romans	Rom	45	1	29	being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice; they are gossips,
Romans	Rom	45	1	30	slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,
Romans	Rom	45	1	31	without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful;
Romans	Rom	45	1	32	and although they know the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but also give hearty approval to those who practice them.
Romans	Rom	45	2	1	Therefore you have no excuse, everyone of you who passes judgment, for in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself; for you who judge practice the same things.
Romans	Rom	45	2	2	And we know that the judgment of God rightly falls upon those who practice such things.
Romans	Rom	45	2	3	But do you suppose this, O man, when you pass judgment on those who practice such things and do the same yourself, that you will escape the judgment of God?
Romans	Rom	45	2	4	Or do you think lightly of the riches of His kindness and tolerance and patience, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance?
Romans	Rom	45	2	5	But because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God,
Romans	Rom	45	2	6	who WILL RENDER TO EACH PERSON ACCORDING TO HIS DEEDS:
Romans	Rom	45	2	7	to those who by perseverance in doing good seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life;
Romans	Rom	45	2	8	but to those who are selfishly ambitious and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, wrath and indignation.
Romans	Rom	45	2	9	There will be tribulation and distress for every soul of man who does evil, of the Jew first and also of the Greek,
Romans	Rom	45	2	10	but glory and honor and peace to everyone who does good, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.
Romans	Rom	45	2	11	For there is no partiality with God.
Romans	Rom	45	2	12	For all who have sinned without the Law will also perish without the Law, and all who have sinned under the Law will be judged by the Law;
Romans	Rom	45	2	13	for it is not the hearers of the Law who are just before God, but the doers of the Law will be justified.
Romans	Rom	45	2	14	For when Gentiles who do not have the Law do instinctively the things of the Law, these, not having the Law, are a law to themselves,
Romans	Rom	45	2	15	in that they show the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts alternately accusing or else defending them,
Romans	Rom	45	2	16	on the day when, according to my gospel, God will judge the secrets of men through Christ Jesus.
Romans	Rom	45	2	17	But if you bear the name "Jew" and rely upon the Law and boast in God,
Romans	Rom	45	2	18	and know His will and approve the things that are essential, being instructed out of the Law,
Romans	Rom	45	2	19	and are confident that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,
Romans	Rom	45	2	20	a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of the immature, having in the Law the embodiment of knowledge and of the truth,
Romans	Rom	45	2	21	you, therefore, who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach that one shall not steal, do you steal?
Romans	Rom	45	2	22	You who say that one should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?
Romans	Rom	45	2	23	You who boast in the Law, through your breaking the Law, do you dishonor God?
Romans	Rom	45	2	24	For "THE NAME OF GOD IS BLASPHEMED AMONG THE GENTILES BECAUSE OF YOU," just as it is written.
Romans	Rom	45	2	25	For indeed circumcision is of value if you practice the Law; but if you are a transgressor of the Law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.
Romans	Rom	45	2	26	So if the uncircumcised man keeps the requirements of the Law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?
Romans	Rom	45	2	27	And he who is physically uncircumcised, if he keeps the Law, will he not judge you who though having the letter of the Law and circumcision are a transgressor of the Law?
Romans	Rom	45	2	28	For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh.
Romans	Rom	45	2	29	But he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that which is of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter; and his praise is not from men, but from God.
Romans	Rom	45	3	1	Then what advantage has the Jew? Or what is the benefit of circumcision?
Romans	Rom	45	3	2	Great in every respect. First of all, that they were entrusted with the oracles of God.
Romans	Rom	45	3	3	What then? If some did not believe, their unbelief will not nullify the faithfulness of God, will it?
Romans	Rom	45	3	4	May it never be! Rather, let God be found true, though every man be found a liar, as it is written, "THAT YOU MAY BE JUSTIFIED IN YOUR WORDS, AND PREVAIL WHEN YOU ARE JUDGED."
Romans	Rom	45	3	5	But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? The God who inflicts wrath is not unrighteous, is He? (I am speaking in human terms.)
Romans	Rom	45	3	6	May it never be! For otherwise, how will God judge the world?
Romans	Rom	45	3	7	But if through my lie the truth of God abounded to His glory, why am I also still being judged as a sinner?
Romans	Rom	45	3	8	And why not say (as we are slanderously reported and as some claim that we say), "Let us do evil that good may come"? Their condemnation is just.
Romans	Rom	45	3	9	What then? Are we better than they? Not at all; for we have already charged that both Jews and Greeks are all under sin;
Romans	Rom	45	3	10	as it is written, "THERE IS NONE RIGHTEOUS, NOT EVEN ONE;
Romans	Rom	45	3	11	THERE IS NONE WHO UNDERSTANDS, THERE IS NONE WHO SEEKS FOR GOD;
Romans	Rom	45	3	12	ALL HAVE TURNED ASIDE, TOGETHER THEY HAVE BECOME USELESS; THERE IS NONE WHO DOES GOOD, THERE IS NOT EVEN ONE."
Romans	Rom	45	3	13	"THEIR THROAT IS AN OPEN GRAVE, WITH THEIR TONGUES THEY KEEP DECEIVING," "THE POISON OF ASPS IS UNDER THEIR LIPS";
Romans	Rom	45	3	14	"WHOSE MOUTH IS FULL OF CURSING AND BITTERNESS";
Romans	Rom	45	3	15	"THEIR FEET ARE SWIFT TO SHED BLOOD,
Romans	Rom	45	3	16	DESTRUCTION AND MISERY ARE IN THEIR PATHS,
Romans	Rom	45	3	17	AND THE PATH OF PEACE THEY HAVE NOT KNOWN."
Romans	Rom	45	3	18	"THERE IS NO FEAR OF GOD BEFORE THEIR EYES."
Romans	Rom	45	3	19	Now we know that whatever the Law says, it speaks to those who are under the Law, so that every mouth may be closed and all the world may become accountable to God;
Romans	Rom	45	3	20	because by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified in His sight; for through the Law comes the knowledge of sin.
Romans	Rom	45	3	21	But now apart from the Law the righteousness of God has been manifested, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets,
Romans	Rom	45	3	22	even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all those who believe; for there is no distinction;
Romans	Rom	45	3	23	for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,
Romans	Rom	45	3	24	being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus;
Romans	Rom	45	3	25	whom God displayed publicly as a propitiation in His blood through faith. This was to demonstrate His righteousness, because in the forbearance of God He passed over the sins previously committed;
Romans	Rom	45	3	26	for the demonstration, I say, of His righteousness at the present time, so that He would be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.
Romans	Rom	45	3	27	Where then is boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? Of works? No, but by a law of faith.
Romans	Rom	45	3	28	For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the Law.
Romans	Rom	45	3	29	Or is God the God of Jews only? Is He not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,
Romans	Rom	45	3	30	since indeed God who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith is one.
Romans	Rom	45	3	31	Do we then nullify the Law through faith? May it never be! On the contrary, we establish the Law.
Romans	Rom	45	4	1	What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, has found?
Romans	Rom	45	4	2	For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God.
Romans	Rom	45	4	3	For what does the Scripture say? "ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS."
Romans	Rom	45	4	4	Now to the one who works, his wage is not credited as a favor, but as what is due.
Romans	Rom	45	4	5	But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness,
Romans	Rom	45	4	6	just as David also speaks of the blessing on the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:
Romans	Rom	45	4	7	"BLESSED ARE THOSE WHOSE LAWLESS DEEDS HAVE BEEN FORGIVEN, AND WHOSE SINS HAVE BEEN COVERED.
Romans	Rom	45	4	8	"BLESSED IS THE MAN WHOSE SIN THE LORD WILL NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT."
Romans	Rom	45	4	9	Is this blessing then on the circumcised, or on the uncircumcised also? For we say, "FAITH WAS CREDITED TO ABRAHAM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS."
Romans	Rom	45	4	10	How then was it credited? While he was circumcised, or uncircumcised? Not while circumcised, but while uncircumcised;
Romans	Rom	45	4	11	and he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while uncircumcised, so that he might be the father of all who believe without being circumcised, that righteousness might be credited to them,
Romans	Rom	45	4	12	and the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also follow in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham which he had while uncircumcised.
Romans	Rom	45	4	13	For the promise to Abraham or to his descendants that he would be heir of the world was not through the Law, but through the righteousness of faith.
Romans	Rom	45	4	14	For if those who are of the Law are heirs, faith is made void and the promise is nullified;
Romans	Rom	45	4	15	for the Law brings about wrath, but where there is no law, there also is no violation.
Romans	Rom	45	4	16	For this reason it is by faith, in order that it may be in accordance with grace, so that the promise will be guaranteed to all the descendants, not only to those who are of the Law, but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,
Romans	Rom	45	4	17	(as it is written, "A FATHER OF MANY NATIONS HAVE I MADE YOU") in the presence of Him whom he believed, even God, who gives life to the dead and calls into being that which does not exist.
Romans	Rom	45	4	18	In hope against hope he believed, so that he might become a father of many nations according to that which had been spoken, "SO SHALL YOUR DESCENDANTS BE."
Romans	Rom	45	4	19	Without becoming weak in faith he contemplated his own body, now as good as dead since he was about a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah's womb;
Romans	Rom	45	4	20	yet, with respect to the promise of God, he did not waver in unbelief but grew strong in faith, giving glory to God,
Romans	Rom	45	4	21	and being fully assured that what God had promised, He was able also to perform.
Romans	Rom	45	4	22	Therefore IT WAS ALSO CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS.
Romans	Rom	45	4	23	Now not for his sake only was it written that it was credited to him,
Romans	Rom	45	4	24	but for our sake also, to whom it will be credited, as those who believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,
Romans	Rom	45	4	25	He who was delivered over because of our transgressions, and was raised because of our justification.
Romans	Rom	45	5	1	Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
Romans	Rom	45	5	2	through whom also we have obtained our introduction by faith into this grace in which we stand; and we exult in hope of the glory of God.
Romans	Rom	45	5	3	And not only this, but we also exult in our tribulations, knowing that tribulation brings about perseverance;
Romans	Rom	45	5	4	and perseverance, proven character; and proven character, hope;
Romans	Rom	45	5	5	and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.
Romans	Rom	45	5	6	For while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.
Romans	Rom	45	5	7	For one will hardly die for a righteous man; though perhaps for the good man someone would dare even to die.
Romans	Rom	45	5	8	But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
Romans	Rom	45	5	9	Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him.
Romans	Rom	45	5	10	For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.
Romans	Rom	45	5	11	And not only this, but we also exult in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.
Romans	Rom	45	5	12	Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned--
Romans	Rom	45	5	13	for until the Law sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed when there is no law.
Romans	Rom	45	5	14	Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who had not sinned in the likeness of the offense of Adam, who is a type of Him who was to come.
Romans	Rom	45	5	15	But the free gift is not like the transgression. For if by the transgression of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many.
Romans	Rom	45	5	16	The gift is not like that which came through the one who sinned; for on the one hand the judgment arose from one transgression resulting in condemnation, but on the other hand the free gift arose from many transgressions resulting in justification.
Romans	Rom	45	5	17	For if by the transgression of the one, death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.
Romans	Rom	45	5	18	So then as through one transgression there resulted condemnation to all men, even so through one act of righteousness there resulted justification of life to all men.
Romans	Rom	45	5	19	For as through the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the One the many will be made righteous.
Romans	Rom	45	5	20	The Law came in so that the transgression would increase; but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more,
Romans	Rom	45	5	21	so that, as sin reigned in death, even so grace would reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
Romans	Rom	45	6	1	What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin so that grace may increase?
Romans	Rom	45	6	2	May it never be! How shall we who died to sin still live in it?
Romans	Rom	45	6	3	Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?
Romans	Rom	45	6	4	Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life.
Romans	Rom	45	6	5	For if we have become united with Him in the likeness of His death, certainly we shall also be in the likeness of His resurrection,
Romans	Rom	45	6	6	knowing this, that our old self was crucified with Him, in order that our body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer be slaves to sin;
Romans	Rom	45	6	7	for he who has died is freed from sin.
Romans	Rom	45	6	8	Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him,
Romans	Rom	45	6	9	knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, is never to die again; death no longer is master over Him.
Romans	Rom	45	6	10	For the death that He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life that He lives, He lives to God.
Romans	Rom	45	6	11	Even so consider yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus.
Romans	Rom	45	6	12	Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its lusts,
Romans	Rom	45	6	13	and do not go on presenting the members of your body to sin as instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.
Romans	Rom	45	6	14	For sin shall not be master over you, for you are not under law but under grace.
Romans	Rom	45	6	15	What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? May it never be!
Romans	Rom	45	6	16	Do you not know that when you present yourselves to someone as slaves for obedience, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin resulting in death, or of obedience resulting in righteousness?
Romans	Rom	45	6	17	But thanks be to God that though you were slaves of sin, you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching to which you were committed,
Romans	Rom	45	6	18	and having been freed from sin, you became slaves of righteousness.
Romans	Rom	45	6	19	I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness, resulting in further lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness, resulting in sanctification.
Romans	Rom	45	6	20	For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.
Romans	Rom	45	6	21	Therefore what benefit were you then deriving from the things of which you are now ashamed? For the outcome of those things is death.
Romans	Rom	45	6	22	But now having been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you derive your benefit, resulting in sanctification, and the outcome, eternal life.
Romans	Rom	45	6	23	For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
Romans	Rom	45	7	1	Or do you not know, brethren (for I am speaking to those who know the law), that the law has jurisdiction over a person as long as he lives?
Romans	Rom	45	7	2	For the married woman is bound by law to her husband while he is living; but if her husband dies, she is released from the law concerning the husband.
Romans	Rom	45	7	3	So then, if while her husband is living she is joined to another man, she shall be called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress though she is joined to another man.
Romans	Rom	45	7	4	Therefore, my brethren, you also were made to die to the Law through the body of Christ, so that you might be joined to another, to Him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit for God.
Romans	Rom	45	7	5	For while we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which were aroused by the Law, were at work in the members of our body to bear fruit for death.
Romans	Rom	45	7	6	But now we have been released from the Law, having died to that by which we were bound, so that we serve in newness of the Spirit and not in oldness of the letter.
Romans	Rom	45	7	7	What shall we say then? Is the Law sin? May it never be! On the contrary, I would not have come to know sin except through the Law; for I would not have known about coveting if the Law had not said, "YOU SHALL NOT COVET."
Romans	Rom	45	7	8	But sin, taking opportunity through the commandment, produced in me coveting of every kind; for apart from the Law sin is dead.
Romans	Rom	45	7	9	I was once alive apart from the Law; but when the commandment came, sin became alive and I died;
Romans	Rom	45	7	10	and this commandment, which was to result in life, proved to result in death for me;
Romans	Rom	45	7	11	for sin, taking an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me.
Romans	Rom	45	7	12	So then, the Law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.
Romans	Rom	45	7	13	Therefore did that which is good become a cause of death for me? May it never be! Rather it was sin, in order that it might be shown to be sin by effecting my death through that which is good, so that through the commandment sin would become utterly sinful.
Romans	Rom	45	7	14	For we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am of flesh, sold into bondage to sin.
Romans	Rom	45	7	15	For what I am doing, I do not understand; for I am not practicing what I would like to do, but I am doing the very thing I hate.
Romans	Rom	45	7	16	But if I do the very thing I do not want to do, I agree with the Law, confessing that the Law is good.
Romans	Rom	45	7	17	So now, no longer am I the one doing it, but sin which dwells in me.
Romans	Rom	45	7	18	For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh; for the willing is present in me, but the doing of the good is not.
Romans	Rom	45	7	19	For the good that I want, I do not do, but I practice the very evil that I do not want.
Romans	Rom	45	7	20	But if I am doing the very thing I do not want, I am no longer the one doing it, but sin which dwells in me.
Romans	Rom	45	7	21	I find then the principle that evil is present in me, the one who wants to do good.
Romans	Rom	45	7	22	For I joyfully concur with the law of God in the inner man,
Romans	Rom	45	7	23	but I see a different law in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin which is in my members.
Romans	Rom	45	7	24	Wretched man that I am! Who will set me free from the body of this death?
Romans	Rom	45	7	25	Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, on the one hand I myself with my mind am serving the law of God, but on the other, with my flesh the law of sin.
Romans	Rom	45	8	1	Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
Romans	Rom	45	8	2	For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death.
Romans	Rom	45	8	3	For what the Law could not do, weak as it was through the flesh, God did: sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and as an offering for sin, He condemned sin in the flesh,
Romans	Rom	45	8	4	so that the requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.
Romans	Rom	45	8	5	For those who are according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who are according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.
Romans	Rom	45	8	6	For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the Spirit is life and peace,
Romans	Rom	45	8	7	because the mind set on the flesh is hostile toward God; for it does not subject itself to the law of God, for it is not even able to do so,
Romans	Rom	45	8	8	and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.
Romans	Rom	45	8	9	However, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him.
Romans	Rom	45	8	10	If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is alive because of righteousness.
Romans	Rom	45	8	11	But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you.
Romans	Rom	45	8	12	So then, brethren, we are under obligation, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh--
Romans	Rom	45	8	13	for if you are living according to the flesh, you must die; but if by the Spirit you are putting to death the deeds of the body, you will live.
Romans	Rom	45	8	14	For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.
Romans	Rom	45	8	15	For you have not received a spirit of slavery leading to fear again, but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out, "Abba! Father!"
Romans	Rom	45	8	16	The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God,
Romans	Rom	45	8	17	and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with Him.
Romans	Rom	45	8	18	For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed to us.
Romans	Rom	45	8	19	For the anxious longing of the creation waits eagerly for the revealing of the sons of God.
Romans	Rom	45	8	20	For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected it, in hope
Romans	Rom	45	8	21	that the creation itself also will be set free from its slavery to corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God.
Romans	Rom	45	8	22	For we know that the whole creation groans and suffers the pains of childbirth together until now.
Romans	Rom	45	8	23	And not only this, but also we ourselves, having the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our body.
Romans	Rom	45	8	24	For in hope we have been saved, but hope that is seen is not hope; for who hopes for what he already sees?
Romans	Rom	45	8	25	But if we hope for what we do not see, with perseverance we wait eagerly for it.
Romans	Rom	45	8	26	In the same way the Spirit also helps our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we should, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words;
Romans	Rom	45	8	27	and He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.
Romans	Rom	45	8	28	And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.
Romans	Rom	45	8	29	For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brethren;
Romans	Rom	45	8	30	and these whom He predestined, He also called; and these whom He called, He also justified; and these whom He justified, He also glorified.
Romans	Rom	45	8	31	What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us?
Romans	Rom	45	8	32	He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him over for us all, how will He not also with Him freely give us all things?
Romans	Rom	45	8	33	Who will bring a charge against God's elect? God is the one who justifies;
Romans	Rom	45	8	34	who is the one who condemns? Christ Jesus is He who died, yes, rather who was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us.
Romans	Rom	45	8	35	Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
Romans	Rom	45	8	36	Just as it is written, "FOR YOUR SAKE WE ARE BEING PUT TO DEATH ALL DAY LONG; WE WERE CONSIDERED AS SHEEP TO BE SLAUGHTERED."
Romans	Rom	45	8	37	But in all these things we overwhelmingly conquer through Him who loved us.
Romans	Rom	45	8	38	For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,
Romans	Rom	45	8	39	nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
Romans	Rom	45	9	1	I am telling the truth in Christ, I am not lying, my conscience testifies with me in the Holy Spirit,
Romans	Rom	45	9	2	that I have great sorrow and unceasing grief in my heart.
Romans	Rom	45	9	3	For I could wish that I myself were accursed, separated from Christ for the sake of my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh,
Romans	Rom	45	9	4	who are Israelites, to whom belongs the adoption as sons, and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the Law and the temple service and the promises,
Romans	Rom	45	9	5	whose are the fathers, and from whom is the Christ according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen.
Romans	Rom	45	9	6	But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For they are not all Israel who are descended from Israel;
Romans	Rom	45	9	7	nor are they all children because they are Abraham's descendants, but: "THROUGH ISAAC YOUR DESCENDANTS WILL BE NAMED."
Romans	Rom	45	9	8	That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are regarded as descendants.
Romans	Rom	45	9	9	For this is the word of promise: "AT THIS TIME I WILL COME, AND SARAH SHALL HAVE A SON."
Romans	Rom	45	9	10	And not only this, but there was Rebekah also, when she had conceived twins by one man, our father Isaac;
Romans	Rom	45	9	11	for though the twins were not yet born and had not done anything good or bad, so that God's purpose according to His choice would stand, not because of works but because of Him who calls,
Romans	Rom	45	9	12	it was said to her, "THE OLDER WILL SERVE THE YOUNGER."
Romans	Rom	45	9	13	Just as it is written, "JACOB I LOVED, BUT ESAU I HATED."
Romans	Rom	45	9	14	What shall we say then? There is no injustice with God, is there? May it never be!
Romans	Rom	45	9	15	For He says to Moses, "I WILL HAVE MERCY ON WHOM I HAVE MERCY, AND I WILL HAVE COMPASSION ON WHOM I HAVE COMPASSION."
Romans	Rom	45	9	16	So then it does not depend on the man who wills or the man who runs, but on God who has mercy.
Romans	Rom	45	9	17	For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, "FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE I RAISED YOU UP, TO DEMONSTRATE MY POWER IN YOU, AND THAT MY NAME MIGHT BE PROCLAIMED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE EARTH."
Romans	Rom	45	9	18	So then He has mercy on whom He desires, and He hardens whom He desires.
Romans	Rom	45	9	19	You will say to me then, "Why does He still find fault? For who resists His will?"
Romans	Rom	45	9	20	On the contrary, who are you, O man, who answers back to God? The thing molded will not say to the molder, "Why did you make me like this," will it?
Romans	Rom	45	9	21	Or does not the potter have a right over the clay, to make from the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for common use?
Romans	Rom	45	9	22	What if God, although willing to demonstrate His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction?
Romans	Rom	45	9	23	And He did so to make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He prepared beforehand for glory,
Romans	Rom	45	9	24	even us, whom He also called, not from among Jews only, but also from among Gentiles.
Romans	Rom	45	9	25	As He says also in Hosea, "I WILL CALL THOSE WHO WERE NOT MY PEOPLE, 'MY PEOPLE,' AND HER WHO WAS NOT BELOVED, 'BELOVED.'"
Romans	Rom	45	9	26	"AND IT SHALL BE THAT IN THE PLACE WHERE IT WAS SAID TO THEM, 'YOU ARE NOT MY PEOPLE,' THERE THEY SHALL BE CALLED SONS OF THE LIVING GOD."
Romans	Rom	45	9	27	Isaiah cries out concerning Israel, "THOUGH THE NUMBER OF THE SONS OF ISRAEL BE LIKE THE SAND OF THE SEA, IT IS THE REMNANT THAT WILL BE SAVED;
Romans	Rom	45	9	28	FOR THE LORD WILL EXECUTE HIS WORD ON THE EARTH, THOROUGHLY AND QUICKLY."
Romans	Rom	45	9	29	And just as Isaiah foretold, "UNLESS THE LORD OF SABAOTH HAD LEFT TO US A POSTERITY, WE WOULD HAVE BECOME LIKE SODOM, AND WOULD HAVE RESEMBLED GOMORRAH."
Romans	Rom	45	9	30	What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, attained righteousness, even the righteousness which is by faith;
Romans	Rom	45	9	31	but Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, did not arrive at that law.
Romans	Rom	45	9	32	Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as though it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone,
Romans	Rom	45	9	33	just as it is written, "BEHOLD, I LAY IN ZION A STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED."
Romans	Rom	45	10	1	Brethren, my heart's desire and my prayer to God for them is for their salvation.
Romans	Rom	45	10	2	For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not in accordance with knowledge.
Romans	Rom	45	10	3	For not knowing about God's righteousness and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God.
Romans	Rom	45	10	4	For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.
Romans	Rom	45	10	5	For Moses writes that the man who practices the righteousness which is based on law shall live by that righteousness.
Romans	Rom	45	10	6	But the righteousness based on faith speaks as follows: "DO NOT SAY IN YOUR HEART, 'WHO WILL ASCEND INTO HEAVEN?' (that is, to bring Christ down),
Romans	Rom	45	10	7	or 'WHO WILL DESCEND INTO THE ABYSS?' (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead)."
Romans	Rom	45	10	8	But what does it say? "THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"--that is, the word of faith which we are preaching,
Romans	Rom	45	10	9	that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved;
Romans	Rom	45	10	10	for with the heart a person believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation.
Romans	Rom	45	10	11	For the Scripture says, "WHOEVER BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED."
Romans	Rom	45	10	12	For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, abounding in riches for all who call on Him;
Romans	Rom	45	10	13	for "WHOEVER WILL CALL ON THE NAME OF THE LORD WILL BE SAVED."
Romans	Rom	45	10	14	How then will they call on Him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in Him whom they have not heard? And how will they hear without a preacher?
Romans	Rom	45	10	15	How will they preach unless they are sent? Just as it is written, "HOW BEAUTIFUL ARE THE FEET OF THOSE WHO BRING GOOD NEWS OF GOOD THINGS!"
Romans	Rom	45	10	16	However, they did not all heed the good news; for Isaiah says, "LORD, WHO HAS BELIEVED OUR REPORT?"
Romans	Rom	45	10	17	So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.
Romans	Rom	45	10	18	But I say, surely they have never heard, have they? Indeed they have; "THEIR VOICE HAS GONE OUT INTO ALL THE EARTH, AND THEIR WORDS TO THE ENDS OF THE WORLD."
Romans	Rom	45	10	19	But I say, surely Israel did not know, did they? First Moses says, "I WILL MAKE YOU JEALOUS BY THAT WHICH IS NOT A NATION, BY A NATION WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WILL I ANGER YOU."
Romans	Rom	45	10	20	And Isaiah is very bold and says, "I WAS FOUND BY THOSE WHO DID NOT SEEK ME, I BECAME MANIFEST TO THOSE WHO DID NOT ASK FOR ME."
Romans	Rom	45	10	21	But as for Israel He says, "ALL THE DAY LONG I HAVE STRETCHED OUT MY HANDS TO A DISOBEDIENT AND OBSTINATE PEOPLE."
Romans	Rom	45	11	1	I say then, God has not rejected His people, has He? May it never be! For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
Romans	Rom	45	11	2	God has not rejected His people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel?
Romans	Rom	45	11	3	"Lord, THEY HAVE KILLED YOUR PROPHETS, THEY HAVE TORN DOWN YOUR ALTARS, AND I ALONE AM LEFT, AND THEY ARE SEEKING MY LIFE."
Romans	Rom	45	11	4	But what is the divine response to him? "I HAVE KEPT for Myself SEVEN THOUSAND MEN WHO HAVE NOT BOWED THE KNEE TO BAAL."
Romans	Rom	45	11	5	In the same way then, there has also come to be at the present time a remnant according to God's gracious choice.
Romans	Rom	45	11	6	But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works, otherwise grace is no longer grace.
Romans	Rom	45	11	7	What then? What Israel is seeking, it has not obtained, but those who were chosen obtained it, and the rest were hardened;
Romans	Rom	45	11	8	just as it is written, "GOD GAVE THEM A SPIRIT OF STUPOR, EYES TO SEE NOT AND EARS TO HEAR NOT, DOWN TO THIS VERY DAY."
Romans	Rom	45	11	9	And David says, "LET THEIR TABLE BECOME A SNARE AND A TRAP, AND A STUMBLING BLOCK AND A RETRIBUTION TO THEM.
Romans	Rom	45	11	10	"LET THEIR EYES BE DARKENED TO SEE NOT, AND BEND THEIR BACKS FOREVER."
Romans	Rom	45	11	11	I say then, they did not stumble so as to fall, did they? May it never be! But by their transgression salvation has come to the Gentiles, to make them jealous.
Romans	Rom	45	11	12	Now if their transgression is riches for the world and their failure is riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fulfillment be!
Romans	Rom	45	11	13	But I am speaking to you who are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I magnify my ministry,
Romans	Rom	45	11	14	if somehow I might move to jealousy my fellow countrymen and save some of them.
Romans	Rom	45	11	15	For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?
Romans	Rom	45	11	16	If the first piece of dough is holy, the lump is also; and if the root is holy, the branches are too.
Romans	Rom	45	11	17	But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them and became partaker with them of the rich root of the olive tree,
Romans	Rom	45	11	18	do not be arrogant toward the branches; but if you are arrogant, remember that it is not you who supports the root, but the root supports you.
Romans	Rom	45	11	19	You will say then, "Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in."
Romans	Rom	45	11	20	Quite right, they were broken off for their unbelief, but you stand by your faith. Do not be conceited, but fear;
Romans	Rom	45	11	21	for if God did not spare the natural branches, He will not spare you, either.
Romans	Rom	45	11	22	Behold then the kindness and severity of God; to those who fell, severity, but to you, God's kindness, if you continue in His kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off.
Romans	Rom	45	11	23	And they also, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.
Romans	Rom	45	11	24	For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these who are the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree?
Romans	Rom	45	11	25	For I do not want you, brethren, to be uninformed of this mystery--so that you will not be wise in your own estimation--that a partial hardening has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in;
Romans	Rom	45	11	26	and so all Israel will be saved; just as it is written, "THE DELIVERER WILL COME FROM ZION, HE WILL REMOVE UNGODLINESS FROM JACOB."
Romans	Rom	45	11	27	"THIS IS MY COVENANT WITH THEM, WHEN I TAKE AWAY THEIR SINS."
Romans	Rom	45	11	28	From the standpoint of the gospel they are enemies for your sake, but from the standpoint of God's choice they are beloved for the sake of the fathers;
Romans	Rom	45	11	29	for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.
Romans	Rom	45	11	30	For just as you once were disobedient to God, but now have been shown mercy because of their disobedience,
Romans	Rom	45	11	31	so these also now have been disobedient, that because of the mercy shown to you they also may now be shown mercy.
Romans	Rom	45	11	32	For God has shut up all in disobedience so that He may show mercy to all.
Romans	Rom	45	11	33	Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways!
Romans	Rom	45	11	34	For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, OR WHO BECAME HIS COUNSELOR?
Romans	Rom	45	11	35	Or WHO HAS FIRST GIVEN TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE PAID BACK TO HIM AGAIN?
Romans	Rom	45	11	36	For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever. Amen.
Romans	Rom	45	12	1	Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship.
Romans	Rom	45	12	2	And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.
Romans	Rom	45	12	3	For through the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think; but to think so as to have sound judgment, as God has allotted to each a measure of faith.
Romans	Rom	45	12	4	For just as we have many members in one body and all the members do not have the same function,
Romans	Rom	45	12	5	so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.
Romans	Rom	45	12	6	Since we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, each of us is to exercise them accordingly: if prophecy, according to the proportion of his faith;
Romans	Rom	45	12	7	if service, in his serving; or he who teaches, in his teaching;
Romans	Rom	45	12	8	or he who exhorts, in his exhortation; he who gives, with liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.
Romans	Rom	45	12	9	Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil; cling to what is good.
Romans	Rom	45	12	10	Be devoted to one another in brotherly love; give preference to one another in honor;
Romans	Rom	45	12	11	not lagging behind in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord;
Romans	Rom	45	12	12	rejoicing in hope, persevering in tribulation, devoted to prayer,
Romans	Rom	45	12	13	contributing to the needs of the saints, practicing hospitality.
Romans	Rom	45	12	14	Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.
Romans	Rom	45	12	15	Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep.
Romans	Rom	45	12	16	Be of the same mind toward one another; do not be haughty in mind, but associate with the lowly. Do not be wise in your own estimation.
Romans	Rom	45	12	17	Never pay back evil for evil to anyone. Respect what is right in the sight of all men.
Romans	Rom	45	12	18	If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all men.
Romans	Rom	45	12	19	Never take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for the wrath of God, for it is written, "VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL REPAY," says the Lord.
Romans	Rom	45	12	20	"BUT IF YOUR ENEMY IS HUNGRY, FEED HIM, AND IF HE IS THIRSTY, GIVE HIM A DRINK; FOR IN SO DOING YOU WILL HEAP BURNING COALS ON HIS HEAD."
Romans	Rom	45	12	21	Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
Romans	Rom	45	13	1	Every person is to be in subjection to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God.
Romans	Rom	45	13	2	Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves.
Romans	Rom	45	13	3	For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good and you will have praise from the same;
Romans	Rom	45	13	4	for it is a minister of God to you for good. But if you do what is evil, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for nothing; for it is a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices evil.
Romans	Rom	45	13	5	Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of wrath, but also for conscience' sake.
Romans	Rom	45	13	6	For because of this you also pay taxes, for rulers are servants of God, devoting themselves to this very thing.
Romans	Rom	45	13	7	Render to all what is due them: tax to whom tax is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor.
Romans	Rom	45	13	8	Owe nothing to anyone except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law.
Romans	Rom	45	13	9	For this, "YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY, YOU SHALL NOT MURDER, YOU SHALL NOT STEAL, YOU SHALL NOT COVET," and if there is any other commandment, it is summed up in this saying, "YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF."
Romans	Rom	45	13	10	Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.
Romans	Rom	45	13	11	Do this, knowing the time, that it is already the hour for you to awaken from sleep; for now salvation is nearer to us than when we believed.
Romans	Rom	45	13	12	The night is almost gone, and the day is near. Therefore let us lay aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.
Romans	Rom	45	13	13	Let us behave properly as in the day, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual promiscuity and sensuality, not in strife and jealousy.
Romans	Rom	45	13	14	But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh in regard to its lusts.
Romans	Rom	45	14	1	Now accept the one who is weak in faith, but not for the purpose of passing judgment on his opinions.
Romans	Rom	45	14	2	One person has faith that he may eat all things, but he who is weak eats vegetables only.
Romans	Rom	45	14	3	The one who eats is not to regard with contempt the one who does not eat, and the one who does not eat is not to judge the one who eats, for God has accepted him.
Romans	Rom	45	14	4	Who are you to judge the servant of another? To his own master he stands or falls; and he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand.
Romans	Rom	45	14	5	One person regards one day above another, another regards every day alike. Each person must be fully convinced in his own mind.
Romans	Rom	45	14	6	He who observes the day, observes it for the Lord, and he who eats, does so for the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who eats not, for the Lord he does not eat, and gives thanks to God.
Romans	Rom	45	14	7	For not one of us lives for himself, and not one dies for himself;
Romans	Rom	45	14	8	for if we live, we live for the Lord, or if we die, we die for the Lord; therefore whether we live or die, we are the Lord's.
Romans	Rom	45	14	9	For to this end Christ died and lived again, that He might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.
Romans	Rom	45	14	10	But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you again, why do you regard your brother with contempt? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God.
Romans	Rom	45	14	11	For it is written, "AS I LIVE, SAYS THE LORD, EVERY KNEE SHALL BOW TO ME, AND EVERY TONGUE SHALL GIVE PRAISE TO GOD."
Romans	Rom	45	14	12	So then each one of us will give an account of himself to God.
Romans	Rom	45	14	13	Therefore let us not judge one another anymore, but rather determine this--not to put an obstacle or a stumbling block in a brother's way.
Romans	Rom	45	14	14	I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself; but to him who thinks anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.
Romans	Rom	45	14	15	For if because of food your brother is hurt, you are no longer walking according to love. Do not destroy with your food him for whom Christ died.
Romans	Rom	45	14	16	Therefore do not let what is for you a good thing be spoken of as evil;
Romans	Rom	45	14	17	for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.
Romans	Rom	45	14	18	For he who in this way serves Christ is acceptable to God and approved by men.
Romans	Rom	45	14	19	So then we pursue the things which make for peace and the building up of one another.
Romans	Rom	45	14	20	Do not tear down the work of God for the sake of food. All things indeed are clean, but they are evil for the man who eats and gives offense.
Romans	Rom	45	14	21	It is good not to eat meat or to drink wine, or to do anything by which your brother stumbles.
Romans	Rom	45	14	22	The faith which you have, have as your own conviction before God. Happy is he who does not condemn himself in what he approves.
Romans	Rom	45	14	23	But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because his eating is not from faith; and whatever is not from faith is sin.
Romans	Rom	45	15	1	Now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those without strength and not just please ourselves.
Romans	Rom	45	15	2	Each of us is to please his neighbor for his good, to his edification.
Romans	Rom	45	15	3	For even Christ did not please Himself; but as it is written, "THE REPROACHES OF THOSE WHO REPROACHED YOU FELL ON ME."
Romans	Rom	45	15	4	For whatever was written in earlier times was written for our instruction, so that through perseverance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.
Romans	Rom	45	15	5	Now may the God who gives perseverance and encouragement grant you to be of the same mind with one another according to Christ Jesus,
Romans	Rom	45	15	6	so that with one accord you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Romans	Rom	45	15	7	Therefore, accept one another, just as Christ also accepted us to the glory of God.
Romans	Rom	45	15	8	For I say that Christ has become a servant to the circumcision on behalf of the truth of God to confirm the promises given to the fathers,
Romans	Rom	45	15	9	and for the Gentiles to glorify God for His mercy; as it is written, "THEREFORE I WILL GIVE PRAISE TO YOU AMONG THE GENTILES, AND I WILL SING TO YOUR NAME."
Romans	Rom	45	15	10	Again he says, "REJOICE, O GENTILES, WITH HIS PEOPLE."
Romans	Rom	45	15	11	And again, "PRAISE THE LORD ALL YOU GENTILES, AND LET ALL THE PEOPLES PRAISE HIM."
Romans	Rom	45	15	12	Again Isaiah says, "THERE SHALL COME THE ROOT OF JESSE, AND HE WHO ARISES TO RULE OVER THE GENTILES, IN HIM SHALL THE GENTILES HOPE."
Romans	Rom	45	15	13	Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you will abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
Romans	Rom	45	15	14	And concerning you, my brethren, I myself also am convinced that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge and able also to admonish one another.
Romans	Rom	45	15	15	But I have written very boldly to you on some points so as to remind you again, because of the grace that was given me from God,
Romans	Rom	45	15	16	to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, so that my offering of the Gentiles may become acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
Romans	Rom	45	15	17	Therefore in Christ Jesus I have found reason for boasting in things pertaining to God.
Romans	Rom	45	15	18	For I will not presume to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me, resulting in the obedience of the Gentiles by word and deed,
Romans	Rom	45	15	19	in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit; so that from Jerusalem and round about as far as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.
Romans	Rom	45	15	20	And thus I aspired to preach the gospel, not where Christ was already named, so that I would not build on another man's foundation;
Romans	Rom	45	15	21	but as it is written, "THEY WHO HAD NO NEWS OF HIM SHALL SEE, AND THEY WHO HAVE NOT HEARD SHALL UNDERSTAND."
Romans	Rom	45	15	22	For this reason I have often been prevented from coming to you;
Romans	Rom	45	15	23	but now, with no further place for me in these regions, and since I have had for many years a longing to come to you
Romans	Rom	45	15	24	whenever I go to Spain--for I hope to see you in passing, and to be helped on my way there by you, when I have first enjoyed your company for a while--
Romans	Rom	45	15	25	but now, I am going to Jerusalem serving the saints.
Romans	Rom	45	15	26	For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.
Romans	Rom	45	15	27	Yes, they were pleased to do so, and they are indebted to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual things, they are indebted to minister to them also in material things.
Romans	Rom	45	15	28	Therefore, when I have finished this, and have put my seal on this fruit of theirs, I will go on by way of you to Spain.
Romans	Rom	45	15	29	I know that when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.
Romans	Rom	45	15	30	Now I urge you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers to God for me,
Romans	Rom	45	15	31	that I may be rescued from those who are disobedient in Judea, and that my service for Jerusalem may prove acceptable to the saints;
Romans	Rom	45	15	32	so that I may come to you in joy by the will of God and find refreshing rest in your company.
Romans	Rom	45	15	33	Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
Romans	Rom	45	16	1	I commend to you our sister Phoebe, who is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea;
Romans	Rom	45	16	2	that you receive her in the Lord in a manner worthy of the saints, and that you help her in whatever matter she may have need of you; for she herself has also been a helper of many, and of myself as well.
Romans	Rom	45	16	3	Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,
Romans	Rom	45	16	4	who for my life risked their own necks, to whom not only do I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles;
Romans	Rom	45	16	5	also greet the church that is in their house. Greet Epaenetus, my beloved, who is the first convert to Christ from Asia.
Romans	Rom	45	16	6	Greet Mary, who has worked hard for you.
Romans	Rom	45	16	7	Greet Andronicus and Junias, my kinsmen and my fellow prisoners, who are outstanding among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.
Romans	Rom	45	16	8	Greet Ampliatus, my beloved in the Lord.
Romans	Rom	45	16	9	Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.
Romans	Rom	45	16	10	Greet Apelles, the approved in Christ. Greet those who are of the household of Aristobulus.
Romans	Rom	45	16	11	Greet Herodion, my kinsman. Greet those of the household of Narcissus, who are in the Lord.
Romans	Rom	45	16	12	Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, workers in the Lord. Greet Persis the beloved, who has worked hard in the Lord.
Romans	Rom	45	16	13	Greet Rufus, a choice man in the Lord, also his mother and mine.
Romans	Rom	45	16	14	Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas and the brethren with them.
Romans	Rom	45	16	15	Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them.
Romans	Rom	45	16	16	Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ greet you.
Romans	Rom	45	16	17	Now I urge you, brethren, keep your eye on those who cause dissensions and hindrances contrary to the teaching which you learned, and turn away from them.
Romans	Rom	45	16	18	For such men are slaves, not of our Lord Christ but of their own appetites; and by their smooth and flattering speech they deceive the hearts of the unsuspecting.
Romans	Rom	45	16	19	For the report of your obedience has reached to all; therefore I am rejoicing over you, but I want you to be wise in what is good and innocent in what is evil.
Romans	Rom	45	16	20	The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.
Romans	Rom	45	16	21	Timothy my fellow worker greets you, and so do Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my kinsmen.
Romans	Rom	45	16	22	I, Tertius, who write this letter, greet you in the Lord.
Romans	Rom	45	16	23	Gaius, host to me and to the whole church, greets you. Erastus, the city treasurer greets you, and Quartus, the brother.
Romans	Rom	45	16	24	[The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.]
Romans	Rom	45	16	25	Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret for long ages past,
Romans	Rom	45	16	26	but now is manifested, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, has been made known to all the nations, leading to obedience of faith;
Romans	Rom	45	16	27	to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, be the glory forever. Amen.

Galatians	Gal	48	1	1	Paul, an apostle (not sent from men nor through the agency of man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised Him from the dead),
Galatians	Gal	48	1	2	and all the brethren who are with me, To the churches of Galatia:
Galatians	Gal	48	1	3	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,
Galatians	Gal	48	1	4	who gave Himself for our sins so that He might rescue us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,
Galatians	Gal	48	1	5	to whom be the glory forevermore. Amen.
Galatians	Gal	48	1	6	I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting Him who called you by the grace of Christ, for a different gospel;
Galatians	Gal	48	1	7	which is really not another; only there are some who are disturbing you and want to distort the gospel of Christ.
Galatians	Gal	48	1	8	But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you, he is to be accursed!
Galatians	Gal	48	1	9	As we have said before, so I say again now, if any man is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, he is to be accursed!
Galatians	Gal	48	1	10	For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a bond-servant of Christ.
Galatians	Gal	48	1	11	For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.
Galatians	Gal	48	1	12	For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.
Galatians	Gal	48	1	13	For you have heard of my former manner of life in Judaism, how I used to persecute the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it;
Galatians	Gal	48	1	14	and I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries among my countrymen, being more extremely zealous for my ancestral traditions.
Galatians	Gal	48	1	15	But when God, who had set me apart even from my mother's womb and called me through His grace, was pleased
Galatians	Gal	48	1	16	to reveal His Son in me so that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood,
Galatians	Gal	48	1	17	nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; but I went away to Arabia, and returned once more to Damascus.
Galatians	Gal	48	1	18	Then three years later I went up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Cephas, and stayed with him fifteen days.
Galatians	Gal	48	1	19	But I did not see any other of the apostles except James, the Lord's brother.
Galatians	Gal	48	1	20	(Now in what I am writing to you, I assure you before God that I am not lying.)
Galatians	Gal	48	1	21	Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
Galatians	Gal	48	1	22	I was still unknown by sight to the churches of Judea which were in Christ;
Galatians	Gal	48	1	23	but only, they kept hearing, "He who once persecuted us is now preaching the faith which he once tried to destroy."
Galatians	Gal	48	1	24	And they were glorifying God because of me.
Galatians	Gal	48	2	1	Then after an interval of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along also.
Galatians	Gal	48	2	2	It was because of a revelation that I went up; and I submitted to them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but I did so in private to those who were of reputation, for fear that I might be running, or had run, in vain.
Galatians	Gal	48	2	3	But not even Titus, who was with me, though he was a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.
Galatians	Gal	48	2	4	But it was because of the false brethren secretly brought in, who had sneaked in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, in order to bring us into bondage.
Galatians	Gal	48	2	5	But we did not yield in subjection to them for even an hour, so that the truth of the gospel would remain with you.
Galatians	Gal	48	2	6	But from those who were of high reputation (what they were makes no difference to me; God shows no partiality)--well, those who were of reputation contributed nothing to me.
Galatians	Gal	48	2	7	But on the contrary, seeing that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been to the circumcised
Galatians	Gal	48	2	8	(for He who effectually worked for Peter in his apostleship to the circumcised effectually worked for me also to the Gentiles),
Galatians	Gal	48	2	9	and recognizing the grace that had been given to me, James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, so that we might go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised.
Galatians	Gal	48	2	10	They only asked us to remember the poor--the very thing I also was eager to do.
Galatians	Gal	48	2	11	But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned.
Galatians	Gal	48	2	12	For prior to the coming of certain men from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he began to withdraw and hold himself aloof, fearing the party of the circumcision.
Galatians	Gal	48	2	13	The rest of the Jews joined him in hypocrisy, with the result that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy.
Galatians	Gal	48	2	14	But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in the presence of all, "If you, being a Jew, live like the Gentiles and not like the Jews, how is it that you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?
Galatians	Gal	48	2	15	"We are Jews by nature and not sinners from among the Gentiles;
Galatians	Gal	48	2	16	nevertheless knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the Law; since by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified.
Galatians	Gal	48	2	17	"But if, while seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves have also been found sinners, is Christ then a minister of sin? May it never be!
Galatians	Gal	48	2	18	"For if I rebuild what I have once destroyed, I prove myself to be a transgressor.
Galatians	Gal	48	2	19	"For through the Law I died to the Law, so that I might live to God.
Galatians	Gal	48	2	20	"I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.
Galatians	Gal	48	2	21	"I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness comes through the Law, then Christ died needlessly."
Galatians	Gal	48	3	1	You foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified?
Galatians	Gal	48	3	2	This is the only thing I want to find out from you: did you receive the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by hearing with faith?
Galatians	Gal	48	3	3	Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?
Galatians	Gal	48	3	4	Did you suffer so many things in vain--if indeed it was in vain?
Galatians	Gal	48	3	5	So then, does He who provides you with the Spirit and works miracles among you, do it by the works of the Law, or by hearing with faith?
Galatians	Gal	48	3	6	Even so Abraham BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS RECKONED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS.
Galatians	Gal	48	3	7	Therefore, be sure that it is those who are of faith who are sons of Abraham.
Galatians	Gal	48	3	8	The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, "ALL THE NATIONS WILL BE BLESSED IN YOU."
Galatians	Gal	48	3	9	So then those who are of faith are blessed with Abraham, the believer.
Galatians	Gal	48	3	10	For as many as are of the works of the Law are under a curse; for it is written, "CURSED IS EVERYONE WHO DOES NOT ABIDE BY ALL THINGS WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE LAW, TO PERFORM THEM."
Galatians	Gal	48	3	11	Now that no one is justified by the Law before God is evident; for, "THE RIGHTEOUS MAN SHALL LIVE BY FAITH."
Galatians	Gal	48	3	12	However, the Law is not of faith; on the contrary, "HE WHO PRACTICES THEM SHALL LIVE BY THEM."
Galatians	Gal	48	3	13	Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having become a curse for us--for it is written, "CURSED IS EVERYONE WHO HANGS ON A TREE"--
Galatians	Gal	48	3	14	in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we would receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
Galatians	Gal	48	3	15	Brethren, I speak in terms of human relations: even though it is only a man's covenant, yet when it has been ratified, no one sets it aside or adds conditions to it.
Galatians	Gal	48	3	16	Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He does not say, "And to seeds," as referring to many, but rather to one, "And to your seed," that is, Christ.
Galatians	Gal	48	3	17	What I am saying is this: the Law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, does not invalidate a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to nullify the promise.
Galatians	Gal	48	3	18	For if the inheritance is based on law, it is no longer based on a promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by means of a promise.
Galatians	Gal	48	3	19	Why the Law then? It was added because of transgressions, having been ordained through angels by the agency of a mediator, until the seed would come to whom the promise had been made.
Galatians	Gal	48	3	20	Now a mediator is not for one party only; whereas God is only one.
Galatians	Gal	48	3	21	Is the Law then contrary to the promises of God? May it never be! For if a law had been given which was able to impart life, then righteousness would indeed have been based on law.
Galatians	Gal	48	3	22	But the Scripture has shut up everyone under sin, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.
Galatians	Gal	48	3	23	But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.
Galatians	Gal	48	3	24	Therefore the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, so that we may be justified by faith.
Galatians	Gal	48	3	25	But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.
Galatians	Gal	48	3	26	For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
Galatians	Gal	48	3	27	For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.
Galatians	Gal	48	3	28	There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
Galatians	Gal	48	3	29	And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's descendants, heirs according to promise.
Galatians	Gal	48	4	1	Now I say, as long as the heir is a child, he does not differ at all from a slave although he is owner of everything,
Galatians	Gal	48	4	2	but he is under guardians and managers until the date set by the father.
Galatians	Gal	48	4	3	So also we, while we were children, were held in bondage under the elemental things of the world.
Galatians	Gal	48	4	4	But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the Law,
Galatians	Gal	48	4	5	so that He might redeem those who were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.
Galatians	Gal	48	4	6	Because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, "Abba! Father!"
Galatians	Gal	48	4	7	Therefore you are no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God.
Galatians	Gal	48	4	8	However at that time, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those which by nature are no gods.
Galatians	Gal	48	4	9	But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how is it that you turn back again to the weak and worthless elemental things, to which you desire to be enslaved all over again?
Galatians	Gal	48	4	10	You observe days and months and seasons and years.
Galatians	Gal	48	4	11	I fear for you, that perhaps I have labored over you in vain.
Galatians	Gal	48	4	12	I beg of you, brethren, become as I am, for I also have become as you are. You have done me no wrong;
Galatians	Gal	48	4	13	but you know that it was because of a bodily illness that I preached the gospel to you the first time;
Galatians	Gal	48	4	14	and that which was a trial to you in my bodily condition you did not despise or loathe, but you received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus Himself.
Galatians	Gal	48	4	15	Where then is that sense of blessing you had? For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.
Galatians	Gal	48	4	16	So have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?
Galatians	Gal	48	4	17	They eagerly seek you, not commendably, but they wish to shut you out so that you will seek them.
Galatians	Gal	48	4	18	But it is good always to be eagerly sought in a commendable manner, and not only when I am present with you.
Galatians	Gal	48	4	19	My children, with whom I am again in labor until Christ is formed in you--
Galatians	Gal	48	4	20	but I could wish to be present with you now and to change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.
Galatians	Gal	48	4	21	Tell me, you who want to be under law, do you not listen to the law?
Galatians	Gal	48	4	22	For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the bondwoman and one by the free woman.
Galatians	Gal	48	4	23	But the son by the bondwoman was born according to the flesh, and the son by the free woman through the promise.
Galatians	Gal	48	4	24	This is allegorically speaking, for these women are two covenants: one proceeding from Mount Sinai bearing children who are to be slaves; she is Hagar.
Galatians	Gal	48	4	25	Now this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children.
Galatians	Gal	48	4	26	But the Jerusalem above is free; she is our mother.
Galatians	Gal	48	4	27	For it is written, "REJOICE, BARREN WOMAN WHO DOES NOT BEAR; BREAK FORTH AND SHOUT, YOU WHO ARE NOT IN LABOR; FOR MORE NUMEROUS ARE THE CHILDREN OF THE DESOLATE THAN OF THE ONE WHO HAS A HUSBAND."
Galatians	Gal	48	4	28	And you brethren, like Isaac, are children of promise.
Galatians	Gal	48	4	29	But as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so it is now also.
Galatians	Gal	48	4	30	But what does the Scripture say? "CAST OUT THE BONDWOMAN AND HER SON, FOR THE SON OF THE BONDWOMAN SHALL NOT BE AN HEIR WITH THE SON OF THE FREE WOMAN."
Galatians	Gal	48	4	31	So then, brethren, we are not children of a bondwoman, but of the free woman.
Galatians	Gal	48	5	1	It was for freedom that Christ set us free; therefore keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery.
Galatians	Gal	48	5	2	Behold I, Paul, say to you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will be of no benefit to you.
Galatians	Gal	48	5	3	And I testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is under obligation to keep the whole Law.
Galatians	Gal	48	5	4	You have been severed from Christ, you who are seeking to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace.
Galatians	Gal	48	5	5	For we through the Spirit, by faith, are waiting for the hope of righteousness.
Galatians	Gal	48	5	6	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but faith working through love.
Galatians	Gal	48	5	7	You were running well; who hindered you from obeying the truth?
Galatians	Gal	48	5	8	This persuasion did not come from Him who calls you.
Galatians	Gal	48	5	9	A little leaven leavens the whole lump of dough.
Galatians	Gal	48	5	10	I have confidence in you in the Lord that you will adopt no other view; but the one who is disturbing you will bear his judgment, whoever he is.
Galatians	Gal	48	5	11	But I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been abolished.
Galatians	Gal	48	5	12	I wish that those who are troubling you would even mutilate themselves.
Galatians	Gal	48	5	13	For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.
Galatians	Gal	48	5	14	For the whole Law is fulfilled in one word, in the statement, "YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF."
Galatians	Gal	48	5	15	But if you bite and devour one another, take care that you are not consumed by one another.
Galatians	Gal	48	5	16	But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh.
Galatians	Gal	48	5	17	For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are in opposition to one another, so that you may not do the things that you please.
Galatians	Gal	48	5	18	But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law.
Galatians	Gal	48	5	19	Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are: immorality, impurity, sensuality,
Galatians	Gal	48	5	20	idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions,
Galatians	Gal	48	5	21	envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, of which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.
Galatians	Gal	48	5	22	But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
Galatians	Gal	48	5	23	gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.
Galatians	Gal	48	5	24	Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
Galatians	Gal	48	5	25	If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.
Galatians	Gal	48	5	26	Let us not become boastful, challenging one another, envying one another.
Galatians	Gal	48	6	1	Brethren, even if anyone is caught in any trespass, you who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; each one looking to yourself, so that you too will not be tempted.
Galatians	Gal	48	6	2	Bear one another's burdens, and thereby fulfill the law of Christ.
Galatians	Gal	48	6	3	For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.
Galatians	Gal	48	6	4	But each one must examine his own work, and then he will have reason for boasting in regard to himself alone, and not in regard to another.
Galatians	Gal	48	6	5	For each one will bear his own load.
Galatians	Gal	48	6	6	The one who is taught the word is to share all good things with the one who teaches him.
Galatians	Gal	48	6	7	Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, this he will also reap.
Galatians	Gal	48	6	8	For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.
Galatians	Gal	48	6	9	Let us not lose heart in doing good, for in due time we will reap if we do not grow weary.
Galatians	Gal	48	6	10	So then, while we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, and especially to those who are of the household of the faith.
Galatians	Gal	48	6	11	See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand.
Galatians	Gal	48	6	12	Those who desire to make a good showing in the flesh try to compel you to be circumcised, simply so that they will not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.
Galatians	Gal	48	6	13	For those who are circumcised do not even keep the Law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised so that they may boast in your flesh.
Galatians	Gal	48	6	14	But may it never be that I would boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
Galatians	Gal	48	6	15	For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.
Galatians	Gal	48	6	16	And those who will walk by this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.
Galatians	Gal	48	6	17	From now on let no one cause trouble for me, for I bear on my body the brand-marks of Jesus.
Galatians	Gal	48	6	18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.
Ephesians	Eph	49	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, To the saints who are at Ephesus and who are faithful in Christ Jesus:
Ephesians	Eph	49	1	2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Ephesians	Eph	49	1	3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ,
Ephesians	Eph	49	1	4	just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love
Ephesians	Eph	49	1	5	He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will,
Ephesians	Eph	49	1	6	to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us in the Beloved.
Ephesians	Eph	49	1	7	In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace
Ephesians	Eph	49	1	8	which He lavished on us. In all wisdom and insight
Ephesians	Eph	49	1	9	He made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His kind intention which He purposed in Him
Ephesians	Eph	49	1	10	with a view to an administration suitable to the fullness of the times, that is, the summing up of all things in Christ, things in the heavens and things on the earth. In Him
Ephesians	Eph	49	1	11	also we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to His purpose who works all things after the counsel of His will,
Ephesians	Eph	49	1	12	to the end that we who were the first to hope in Christ would be to the praise of His glory.
Ephesians	Eph	49	1	13	In Him, you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation--having also believed, you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of promise,
Ephesians	Eph	49	1	14	who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of God's own possession, to the praise of His glory.
Ephesians	Eph	49	1	15	For this reason I too, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which exists among you and your love for all the saints,
Ephesians	Eph	49	1	16	do not cease giving thanks for you, while making mention of you in my prayers;
Ephesians	Eph	49	1	17	that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of Him.
Ephesians	Eph	49	1	18	I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you will know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints,
Ephesians	Eph	49	1	19	and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe. These are in accordance with the working of the strength of His might
Ephesians	Eph	49	1	20	which He brought about in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places,
Ephesians	Eph	49	1	21	far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come.
Ephesians	Eph	49	1	22	And He put all things in subjection under His feet, and gave Him as head over all things to the church,
Ephesians	Eph	49	1	23	which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.
Ephesians	Eph	49	2	1	And you were dead in your trespasses and sins,
Ephesians	Eph	49	2	2	in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience.
Ephesians	Eph	49	2	3	Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest.
Ephesians	Eph	49	2	4	But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us,
Ephesians	Eph	49	2	5	even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),
Ephesians	Eph	49	2	6	and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,
Ephesians	Eph	49	2	7	so that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
Ephesians	Eph	49	2	8	For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God;
Ephesians	Eph	49	2	9	not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.
Ephesians	Eph	49	2	10	For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.
Ephesians	Eph	49	2	11	Therefore remember that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called "Uncircumcision" by the so-called "Circumcision," which is performed in the flesh by human hands--
Ephesians	Eph	49	2	12	remember that you were at that time separate from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.
Ephesians	Eph	49	2	13	But now in Christ Jesus you who formerly were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.
Ephesians	Eph	49	2	14	For He Himself is our peace, who made both groups into one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall,
Ephesians	Eph	49	2	15	by abolishing in His flesh the enmity, which is the Law of commandments contained in ordinances, so that in Himself He might make the two into one new man, thus establishing peace,
Ephesians	Eph	49	2	16	and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, by it having put to death the enmity.
Ephesians	Eph	49	2	17	AND HE CAME AND PREACHED PEACE TO YOU WHO WERE FAR AWAY, AND PEACE TO THOSE WHO WERE NEAR;
Ephesians	Eph	49	2	18	for through Him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father.
Ephesians	Eph	49	2	19	So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and are of God's household,
Ephesians	Eph	49	2	20	having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the corner stone,
Ephesians	Eph	49	2	21	in whom the whole building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord,
Ephesians	Eph	49	2	22	in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling of God in the Spirit.
Ephesians	Eph	49	3	1	For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles--
Ephesians	Eph	49	3	2	if indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God's grace which was given to me for you;
Ephesians	Eph	49	3	3	that by revelation there was made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before in brief.
Ephesians	Eph	49	3	4	By referring to this, when you read you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,
Ephesians	Eph	49	3	5	which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit;
Ephesians	Eph	49	3	6	to be specific, that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel,
Ephesians	Eph	49	3	7	of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of God's grace which was given to me according to the working of His power.
Ephesians	Eph	49	3	8	To me, the very least of all saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ,
Ephesians	Eph	49	3	9	and to bring to light what is the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God who created all things;
Ephesians	Eph	49	3	10	so that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known through the church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly places.
Ephesians	Eph	49	3	11	This was in accordance with the eternal purpose which He carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord,
Ephesians	Eph	49	3	12	in whom we have boldness and confident access through faith in Him.
Ephesians	Eph	49	3	13	Therefore I ask you not to lose heart at my tribulations on your behalf, for they are your glory.
Ephesians	Eph	49	3	14	For this reason I bow my knees before the Father,
Ephesians	Eph	49	3	15	from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name,
Ephesians	Eph	49	3	16	that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man,
Ephesians	Eph	49	3	17	so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and that you, being rooted and grounded in love,
Ephesians	Eph	49	3	18	may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,
Ephesians	Eph	49	3	19	and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.
Ephesians	Eph	49	3	20	Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us,
Ephesians	Eph	49	3	21	to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen.
Ephesians	Eph	49	4	1	Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called,
Ephesians	Eph	49	4	2	with all humility and gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance for one another in love,
Ephesians	Eph	49	4	3	being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
Ephesians	Eph	49	4	4	There is one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling;
Ephesians	Eph	49	4	5	one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
Ephesians	Eph	49	4	6	one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all.
Ephesians	Eph	49	4	7	But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of Christ's gift.
Ephesians	Eph	49	4	8	Therefore it says, "WHEN HE ASCENDED ON HIGH, HE LED CAPTIVE A HOST OF CAPTIVES, AND HE GAVE GIFTS TO MEN."
Ephesians	Eph	49	4	9	(Now this expression, "He ascended," what does it mean except that He also had descended into the lower parts of the earth?
Ephesians	Eph	49	4	10	He who descended is Himself also He who ascended far above all the heavens, so that He might fill all things.)
Ephesians	Eph	49	4	11	And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers,
Ephesians	Eph	49	4	12	for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ;
Ephesians	Eph	49	4	13	until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ.
Ephesians	Eph	49	4	14	As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming;
Ephesians	Eph	49	4	15	but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ,
Ephesians	Eph	49	4	16	from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love.
Ephesians	Eph	49	4	17	So this I say, and affirm together with the Lord, that you walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind,
Ephesians	Eph	49	4	18	being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart;
Ephesians	Eph	49	4	19	and they, having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness.
Ephesians	Eph	49	4	20	But you did not learn Christ in this way,
Ephesians	Eph	49	4	21	if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him, just as truth is in Jesus,
Ephesians	Eph	49	4	22	that, in reference to your former manner of life, you lay aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit,
Ephesians	Eph	49	4	23	and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind,
Ephesians	Eph	49	4	24	and put on the new self, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth.
Ephesians	Eph	49	4	25	Therefore, laying aside falsehood, SPEAK TRUTH EACH ONE of you WITH HIS NEIGHBOR, for we are members of one another.
Ephesians	Eph	49	4	26	BE ANGRY, AND yet DO NOT SIN; do not let the sun go down on your anger,
Ephesians	Eph	49	4	27	and do not give the devil an opportunity.
Ephesians	Eph	49	4	28	He who steals must steal no longer; but rather he must labor, performing with his own hands what is good, so that he will have something to share with one who has need.
Ephesians	Eph	49	4	29	Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth, but only such a word as is good for edification according to the need of the moment, so that it will give grace to those who hear.
Ephesians	Eph	49	4	30	Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
Ephesians	Eph	49	4	31	Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice.
Ephesians	Eph	49	4	32	Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you.
Ephesians	Eph	49	5	1	Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children;
Ephesians	Eph	49	5	2	and walk in love, just as Christ also loved you and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma.
Ephesians	Eph	49	5	3	But immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints;
Ephesians	Eph	49	5	4	and there must be no filthiness and silly talk, or coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks.
Ephesians	Eph	49	5	5	For this you know with certainty, that no immoral or impure person or covetous man, who is an idolater, has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.
Ephesians	Eph	49	5	6	Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.
Ephesians	Eph	49	5	7	Therefore do not be partakers with them;
Ephesians	Eph	49	5	8	for you were formerly darkness, but now you are Light in the Lord; walk as children of Light
Ephesians	Eph	49	5	9	(for the fruit of the Light consists in all goodness and righteousness and truth),
Ephesians	Eph	49	5	10	trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord.
Ephesians	Eph	49	5	11	Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but instead even expose them;
Ephesians	Eph	49	5	12	for it is disgraceful even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret.
Ephesians	Eph	49	5	13	But all things become visible when they are exposed by the light, for everything that becomes visible is light.
Ephesians	Eph	49	5	14	For this reason it says, "Awake, sleeper, And arise from the dead, And Christ will shine on you."
Ephesians	Eph	49	5	15	Therefore be careful how you walk, not as unwise men but as wise,
Ephesians	Eph	49	5	16	making the most of your time, because the days are evil.
Ephesians	Eph	49	5	17	So then do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.
Ephesians	Eph	49	5	18	And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit,
Ephesians	Eph	49	5	19	speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord;
Ephesians	Eph	49	5	20	always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father;
Ephesians	Eph	49	5	21	and be subject to one another in the fear of Christ.
Ephesians	Eph	49	5	22	Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord.
Ephesians	Eph	49	5	23	For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, He Himself being the Savior of the body.
Ephesians	Eph	49	5	24	But as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives ought to be to their husbands in everything.
Ephesians	Eph	49	5	25	Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her,
Ephesians	Eph	49	5	26	so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,
Ephesians	Eph	49	5	27	that He might present to Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that she would be holy and blameless.
Ephesians	Eph	49	5	28	So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself;
Ephesians	Eph	49	5	29	for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church,
Ephesians	Eph	49	5	30	because we are members of His body.
Ephesians	Eph	49	5	31	FOR THIS REASON A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND SHALL BE JOINED TO HIS WIFE, AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH.
Ephesians	Eph	49	5	32	This mystery is great; but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church.
Ephesians	Eph	49	5	33	Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to love his own wife even as himself, and the wife must see to it that she respects her husband.
Ephesians	Eph	49	6	1	Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
Ephesians	Eph	49	6	2	HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER (which is the first commandment with a promise),
Ephesians	Eph	49	6	3	SO THAT IT MAY BE WELL WITH YOU, AND THAT YOU MAY LIVE LONG ON THE EARTH.
Ephesians	Eph	49	6	4	Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.
Ephesians	Eph	49	6	5	Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the sincerity of your heart, as to Christ;
Ephesians	Eph	49	6	6	not by way of eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart.
Ephesians	Eph	49	6	7	With good will render service, as to the Lord, and not to men,
Ephesians	Eph	49	6	8	knowing that whatever good thing each one does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether slave or free.
Ephesians	Eph	49	6	9	And masters, do the same things to them, and give up threatening, knowing that both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no partiality with Him.
Ephesians	Eph	49	6	10	Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of His might.
Ephesians	Eph	49	6	11	Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil.
Ephesians	Eph	49	6	12	For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.
Ephesians	Eph	49	6	13	Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm.
Ephesians	Eph	49	6	14	Stand firm therefore, HAVING GIRDED YOUR LOINS WITH TRUTH, and HAVING PUT ON THE BREASTPLATE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS,
Ephesians	Eph	49	6	15	and having shod YOUR FEET WITH THE PREPARATION OF THE GOSPEL OF PEACE;
Ephesians	Eph	49	6	16	in addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.
Ephesians	Eph	49	6	17	And take THE HELMET OF SALVATION, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
Ephesians	Eph	49	6	18	With all prayer and petition pray at all times in the Spirit, and with this in view, be on the alert with all perseverance and petition for all the saints,
Ephesians	Eph	49	6	19	and pray on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel,
Ephesians	Eph	49	6	20	for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in proclaiming it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.
Ephesians	Eph	49	6	21	But that you also may know about my circumstances, how I am doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make everything known to you.
Ephesians	Eph	49	6	22	I have sent him to you for this very purpose, so that you may know about us, and that he may comfort your hearts.
Ephesians	Eph	49	6	23	Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Ephesians	Eph	49	6	24	Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with incorruptible love.
Philippians	Phi	50	1	1	Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus, To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, including the overseers and deacons:
Philippians	Phi	50	1	2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Philippians	Phi	50	1	3	I thank my God in all my remembrance of you,
Philippians	Phi	50	1	4	always offering prayer with joy in my every prayer for you all,
Philippians	Phi	50	1	5	in view of your participation in the gospel from the first day until now.
Philippians	Phi	50	1	6	For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus.
Philippians	Phi	50	1	7	For it is only right for me to feel this way about you all, because I have you in my heart, since both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of grace with me.
Philippians	Phi	50	1	8	For God is my witness, how I long for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus.
Philippians	Phi	50	1	9	And this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment,
Philippians	Phi	50	1	10	so that you may approve the things that are excellent, in order to be sincere and blameless until the day of Christ;
Philippians	Phi	50	1	11	having been filled with the fruit of righteousness which comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.
Philippians	Phi	50	1	12	Now I want you to know, brethren, that my circumstances have turned out for the greater progress of the gospel,
Philippians	Phi	50	1	13	so that my imprisonment in the cause of Christ has become well known throughout the whole praetorian guard and to everyone else,
Philippians	Phi	50	1	14	and that most of the brethren, trusting in the Lord because of my imprisonment, have far more courage to speak the word of God without fear.
Philippians	Phi	50	1	15	Some, to be sure, are preaching Christ even from envy and strife, but some also from good will;
Philippians	Phi	50	1	16	the latter do it out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel;
Philippians	Phi	50	1	17	the former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition rather than from pure motives, thinking to cause me distress in my imprisonment.
Philippians	Phi	50	1	18	What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and in this I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice,
Philippians	Phi	50	1	19	for I know that this will turn out for my deliverance through your prayers and the provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
Philippians	Phi	50	1	20	according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will not be put to shame in anything, but that with all boldness, Christ will even now, as always, be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.
Philippians	Phi	50	1	21	For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.
Philippians	Phi	50	1	22	But if I am to live on in the flesh, this will mean fruitful labor for me; and I do not know which to choose.
Philippians	Phi	50	1	23	But I am hard-pressed from both directions, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, for that is very much better;
Philippians	Phi	50	1	24	yet to remain on in the flesh is more necessary for your sake.
Philippians	Phi	50	1	25	Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy in the faith,
Philippians	Phi	50	1	26	so that your proud confidence in me may abound in Christ Jesus through my coming to you again.
Philippians	Phi	50	1	27	Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or remain absent, I will hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;
Philippians	Phi	50	1	28	in no way alarmed by your opponents--which is a sign of destruction for them, but of salvation for you, and that too, from God.
Philippians	Phi	50	1	29	For to you it has been granted for Christ's sake, not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for His sake,
Philippians	Phi	50	1	30	experiencing the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear to be in me.
Philippians	Phi	50	2	1	Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion,
Philippians	Phi	50	2	2	make my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose.
Philippians	Phi	50	2	3	Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves;
Philippians	Phi	50	2	4	do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others.
Philippians	Phi	50	2	5	Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus,
Philippians	Phi	50	2	6	who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped,
Philippians	Phi	50	2	7	but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men.
Philippians	Phi	50	2	8	Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.
Philippians	Phi	50	2	9	For this reason also, God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name,
Philippians	Phi	50	2	10	so that at the name of Jesus EVERY KNEE WILL BOW, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
Philippians	Phi	50	2	11	and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
Philippians	Phi	50	2	12	So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling;
Philippians	Phi	50	2	13	for it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for His good pleasure.
Philippians	Phi	50	2	14	Do all things without grumbling or disputing;
Philippians	Phi	50	2	15	so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world,
Philippians	Phi	50	2	16	holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain.
Philippians	Phi	50	2	17	But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with you all.
Philippians	Phi	50	2	18	You too, I urge you, rejoice in the same way and share your joy with me.
Philippians	Phi	50	2	19	But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, so that I also may be encouraged when I learn of your condition.
Philippians	Phi	50	2	20	For I have no one else of kindred spirit who will genuinely be concerned for your welfare.
Philippians	Phi	50	2	21	For they all seek after their own interests, not those of Christ Jesus.
Philippians	Phi	50	2	22	But you know of his proven worth, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father.
Philippians	Phi	50	2	23	Therefore I hope to send him immediately, as soon as I see how things go with me;
Philippians	Phi	50	2	24	and I trust in the Lord that I myself also will be coming shortly.
Philippians	Phi	50	2	25	But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my need;
Philippians	Phi	50	2	26	because he was longing for you all and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick.
Philippians	Phi	50	2	27	For indeed he was sick to the point of death, but God had mercy on him, and not on him only but also on me, so that I would not have sorrow upon sorrow.
Philippians	Phi	50	2	28	Therefore I have sent him all the more eagerly so that when you see him again you may rejoice and I may be less concerned about you.
Philippians	Phi	50	2	29	Receive him then in the Lord with all joy, and hold men like him in high regard;
Philippians	Phi	50	2	30	because he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was deficient in your service to me.
Philippians	Phi	50	3	1	Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things again is no trouble to me, and it is a safeguard for you.
Philippians	Phi	50	3	2	Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the false circumcision;
Philippians	Phi	50	3	3	for we are the true circumcision, who worship in the Spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh,
Philippians	Phi	50	3	4	although I myself might have confidence even in the flesh. If anyone else has a mind to put confidence in the flesh, I far more:
Philippians	Phi	50	3	5	circumcised the eighth day, of the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the Law, a Pharisee;
Philippians	Phi	50	3	6	as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to the righteousness which is in the Law, found blameless.
Philippians	Phi	50	3	7	But whatever things were gain to me, those things I have counted as loss for the sake of Christ.
Philippians	Phi	50	3	8	More than that, I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ,
Philippians	Phi	50	3	9	and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith,
Philippians	Phi	50	3	10	that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death;
Philippians	Phi	50	3	11	in order that I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.
Philippians	Phi	50	3	12	Not that I have already obtained it or have already become perfect, but I press on so that I may lay hold of that for which also I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus.
Philippians	Phi	50	3	13	Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead,
Philippians	Phi	50	3	14	I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
Philippians	Phi	50	3	15	Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, have this attitude; and if in anything you have a different attitude, God will reveal that also to you;
Philippians	Phi	50	3	16	however, let us keep living by that same standard to which we have attained.
Philippians	Phi	50	3	17	Brethren, join in following my example, and observe those who walk according to the pattern you have in us.
Philippians	Phi	50	3	18	For many walk, of whom I often told you, and now tell you even weeping, that they are enemies of the cross of Christ,
Philippians	Phi	50	3	19	whose end is destruction, whose god is their appetite, and whose glory is in their shame, who set their minds on earthly things.
Philippians	Phi	50	3	20	For our citizenship is in heaven, from which also we eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ;
Philippians	Phi	50	3	21	who will transform the body of our humble state into conformity with the body of His glory, by the exertion of the power that He has even to subject all things to Himself.
Philippians	Phi	50	4	1	Therefore, my beloved brethren whom I long to see, my joy and crown, in this way stand firm in the Lord, my beloved.
Philippians	Phi	50	4	2	I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to live in harmony in the Lord.
Philippians	Phi	50	4	3	Indeed, true companion, I ask you also to help these women who have shared my struggle in the cause of the gospel, together with Clement also and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.
Philippians	Phi	50	4	4	Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice!
Philippians	Phi	50	4	5	Let your gentle spirit be known to all men. The Lord is near.
Philippians	Phi	50	4	6	Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.
Philippians	Phi	50	4	7	And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
Philippians	Phi	50	4	8	Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise, dwell on these things.
Philippians	Phi	50	4	9	The things you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you.
Philippians	Phi	50	4	10	But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at last you have revived your concern for me; indeed, you were concerned before, but you lacked opportunity.
Philippians	Phi	50	4	11	Not that I speak from want, for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am.
Philippians	Phi	50	4	12	I know how to get along with humble means, and I also know how to live in prosperity; in any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of being filled and going hungry, both of having abundance and suffering need.
Philippians	Phi	50	4	13	I can do all things through Him who strengthens me.
Philippians	Phi	50	4	14	Nevertheless, you have done well to share with me in my affliction.
Philippians	Phi	50	4	15	You yourselves also know, Philippians, that at the first preaching of the gospel, after I left Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you alone;
Philippians	Phi	50	4	16	for even in Thessalonica you sent a gift more than once for my needs.
Philippians	Phi	50	4	17	Not that I seek the gift itself, but I seek for the profit which increases to your account.
Philippians	Phi	50	4	18	But I have received everything in full and have an abundance; I am amply supplied, having received from Epaphroditus what you have sent, a fragrant aroma, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God.
Philippians	Phi	50	4	19	And my God will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
Philippians	Phi	50	4	20	Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
Philippians	Phi	50	4	21	Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who are with me greet you.
Philippians	Phi	50	4	22	All the saints greet you, especially those of Caesar's household.
Philippians	Phi	50	4	23	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
Colossians	Col	51	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,
Colossians	Col	51	1	2	To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ who are at Colossae: Grace to you and peace from God our Father.
Colossians	Col	51	1	3	We give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,
Colossians	Col	51	1	4	since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and the love which you have for all the saints;
Colossians	Col	51	1	5	because of the hope laid up for you in heaven, of which you previously heard in the word of truth, the gospel
Colossians	Col	51	1	6	which has come to you, just as in all the world also it is constantly bearing fruit and increasing, even as it has been doing in you also since the day you heard of it and understood the grace of God in truth;
Colossians	Col	51	1	7	just as you learned it from Epaphras, our beloved fellow bond-servant, who is a faithful servant of Christ on our behalf,
Colossians	Col	51	1	8	and he also informed us of your love in the Spirit.
Colossians	Col	51	1	9	For this reason also, since the day we heard of it, we have not ceased to pray for you and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,
Colossians	Col	51	1	10	so that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, to please Him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God;
Colossians	Col	51	1	11	strengthened with all power, according to His glorious might, for the attaining of all steadfastness and patience; joyously
Colossians	Col	51	1	12	giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints in Light.
Colossians	Col	51	1	13	For He rescued us from the domain of darkness, and transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son,
Colossians	Col	51	1	14	in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
Colossians	Col	51	1	15	He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.
Colossians	Col	51	1	16	For by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities--all things have been created through Him and for Him.
Colossians	Col	51	1	17	He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together.
Colossians	Col	51	1	18	He is also head of the body, the church; and He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that He Himself will come to have first place in everything.
Colossians	Col	51	1	19	For it was the Father's good pleasure for all the fullness to dwell in Him,
Colossians	Col	51	1	20	and through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made peace through the blood of His cross; through Him, I say, whether things on earth or things in heaven.
Colossians	Col	51	1	21	And although you were formerly alienated and hostile in mind, engaged in evil deeds,
Colossians	Col	51	1	22	yet He has now reconciled you in His fleshly body through death, in order to present you before Him holy and blameless and beyond reproach--
Colossians	Col	51	1	23	if indeed you continue in the faith firmly established and steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the gospel that you have heard, which was proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and of which I, Paul, was made a minister.
Colossians	Col	51	1	24	Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I do my share on behalf of His body, which is the church, in filling up what is lacking in Christ's afflictions.
Colossians	Col	51	1	25	Of this church I was made a minister according to the stewardship from God bestowed on me for your benefit, so that I might fully carry out the preaching of the word of God,
Colossians	Col	51	1	26	that is, the mystery which has been hidden from the past ages and generations, but has now been manifested to His saints,
Colossians	Col	51	1	27	to whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.
Colossians	Col	51	1	28	We proclaim Him, admonishing every man and teaching every man with all wisdom, so that we may present every man complete in Christ.
Colossians	Col	51	1	29	For this purpose also I labor, striving according to His power, which mightily works within me.
Colossians	Col	51	2	1	For I want you to know how great a struggle I have on your behalf and for those who are at Laodicea, and for all those who have not personally seen my face,
Colossians	Col	51	2	2	that their hearts may be encouraged, having been knit together in love, and attaining to all the wealth that comes from the full assurance of understanding, resulting in a true knowledge of God's mystery, that is, Christ Himself,
Colossians	Col	51	2	3	in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
Colossians	Col	51	2	4	I say this so that no one will delude you with persuasive argument.
Colossians	Col	51	2	5	For even though I am absent in body, nevertheless I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your good discipline and the stability of your faith in Christ.
Colossians	Col	51	2	6	Therefore as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him,
Colossians	Col	51	2	7	having been firmly rooted and now being built up in Him and established in your faith, just as you were instructed, and overflowing with gratitude.
Colossians	Col	51	2	8	See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception, according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary principles of the world, rather than according to Christ.
Colossians	Col	51	2	9	For in Him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form,
Colossians	Col	51	2	10	and in Him you have been made complete, and He is the head over all rule and authority;
Colossians	Col	51	2	11	and in Him you were also circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, in the removal of the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ;
Colossians	Col	51	2	12	having been buried with Him in baptism, in which you were also raised up with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead.
Colossians	Col	51	2	13	When you were dead in your transgressions and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made you alive together with Him, having forgiven us all our transgressions,
Colossians	Col	51	2	14	having canceled out the certificate of debt consisting of decrees against us, which was hostile to us; and He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross.
Colossians	Col	51	2	15	When He had disarmed the rulers and authorities, He made a public display of them, having triumphed over them through Him.
Colossians	Col	51	2	16	Therefore no one is to act as your judge in regard to food or drink or in respect to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day--
Colossians	Col	51	2	17	things which are a mere shadow of what is to come; but the substance belongs to Christ.
Colossians	Col	51	2	18	Let no one keep defrauding you of your prize by delighting in self-abasement and the worship of the angels, taking his stand on visions he has seen, inflated without cause by his fleshly mind,
Colossians	Col	51	2	19	and not holding fast to the head, from whom the entire body, being supplied and held together by the joints and ligaments, grows with a growth which is from God.
Colossians	Col	51	2	20	If you have died with Christ to the elementary principles of the world, why, as if you were living in the world, do you submit yourself to decrees, such as,
Colossians	Col	51	2	21	"Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch!"
Colossians	Col	51	2	22	(which all refer to things destined to perish with use)--in accordance with the commandments and teachings of men?
Colossians	Col	51	2	23	These are matters which have, to be sure, the appearance of wisdom in self-made religion and self-abasement and severe treatment of the body, but are of no value against fleshly indulgence.
Colossians	Col	51	3	1	Therefore if you have been raised up with Christ, keep seeking the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.
Colossians	Col	51	3	2	Set your mind on the things above, not on the things that are on earth.
Colossians	Col	51	3	3	For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
Colossians	Col	51	3	4	When Christ, who is our life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with Him in glory.
Colossians	Col	51	3	5	Therefore consider the members of your earthly body as dead to immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed, which amounts to idolatry.
Colossians	Col	51	3	6	For it is because of these things that the wrath of God will come upon the sons of disobedience,
Colossians	Col	51	3	7	and in them you also once walked, when you were living in them.
Colossians	Col	51	3	8	But now you also, put them all aside: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and abusive speech from your mouth.
Colossians	Col	51	3	9	Do not lie to one another, since you laid aside the old self with its evil practices,
Colossians	Col	51	3	10	and have put on the new self who is being renewed to a true knowledge according to the image of the One who created him--
Colossians	Col	51	3	11	a renewal in which there is no distinction between Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave and freeman, but Christ is all, and in all.
Colossians	Col	51	3	12	So, as those who have been chosen of God, holy and beloved, put on a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience;
Colossians	Col	51	3	13	bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, whoever has a complaint against anyone; just as the Lord forgave you, so also should you.
Colossians	Col	51	3	14	Beyond all these things put on love, which is the perfect bond of unity.
Colossians	Col	51	3	15	Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in one body; and be thankful.
Colossians	Col	51	3	16	Let the word of Christ richly dwell within you, with all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with thankfulness in your hearts to God.
Colossians	Col	51	3	17	Whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks through Him to God the Father.
Colossians	Col	51	3	18	Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.
Colossians	Col	51	3	19	Husbands, love your wives and do not be embittered against them.
Colossians	Col	51	3	20	Children, be obedient to your parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing to the Lord.
Colossians	Col	51	3	21	Fathers, do not exasperate your children, so that they will not lose heart.
Colossians	Col	51	3	22	Slaves, in all things obey those who are your masters on earth, not with external service, as those who merely please men, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord.
Colossians	Col	51	3	23	Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the Lord rather than for men,
Colossians	Col	51	3	24	knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance. It is the Lord Christ whom you serve.
Colossians	Col	51	3	25	For he who does wrong will receive the consequences of the wrong which he has done, and that without partiality.
Colossians	Col	51	4	1	Masters, grant to your slaves justice and fairness, knowing that you too have a Master in heaven.
Colossians	Col	51	4	2	Devote yourselves to prayer, keeping alert in it with an attitude of thanksgiving;
Colossians	Col	51	4	3	praying at the same time for us as well, that God will open up to us a door for the word, so that we may speak forth the mystery of Christ, for which I have also been imprisoned;
Colossians	Col	51	4	4	that I may make it clear in the way I ought to speak.
Colossians	Col	51	4	5	Conduct yourselves with wisdom toward outsiders, making the most of the opportunity.
Colossians	Col	51	4	6	Let your speech always be with grace, as though seasoned with salt, so that you will know how you should respond to each person.
Colossians	Col	51	4	7	As to all my affairs, Tychicus, our beloved brother and faithful servant and fellow bond-servant in the Lord, will bring you information.
Colossians	Col	51	4	8	For I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know about our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts;
Colossians	Col	51	4	9	and with him Onesimus, our faithful and beloved brother, who is one of your number. They will inform you about the whole situation here.
Colossians	Col	51	4	10	Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, sends you his greetings; and also Barnabas's cousin Mark (about whom you received instructions; if he comes to you, welcome him);
Colossians	Col	51	4	11	and also Jesus who is called Justus; these are the only fellow workers for the kingdom of God who are from the circumcision, and they have proved to be an encouragement to me.
Colossians	Col	51	4	12	Epaphras, who is one of your number, a bondslave of Jesus Christ, sends you his greetings, always laboring earnestly for you in his prayers, that you may stand perfect and fully assured in all the will of God.
Colossians	Col	51	4	13	For I testify for him that he has a deep concern for you and for those who are in Laodicea and Hierapolis.
Colossians	Col	51	4	14	Luke, the beloved physician, sends you his greetings, and also Demas.
Colossians	Col	51	4	15	Greet the brethren who are in Laodicea and also Nympha and the church that is in her house.
Colossians	Col	51	4	16	When this letter is read among you, have it also read in the church of the Laodiceans; and you, for your part read my letter that is coming from Laodicea.
Colossians	Col	51	4	17	Say to Archippus, "Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you may fulfill it."
Colossians	Col	51	4	18	I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. Remember my imprisonment. Grace be with you.

Titus	Titus	56	1	1	Paul, a bond-servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the faith of those chosen of God and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,
Titus	Titus	56	1	2	in the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised long ages ago,
Titus	Titus	56	1	3	but at the proper time manifested, even His word, in the proclamation with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior,
Titus	Titus	56	1	4	To Titus, my true child in a common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.
Titus	Titus	56	1	5	For this reason I left you in Crete, that you would set in order what remains and appoint elders in every city as I directed you,
Titus	Titus	56	1	6	namely, if any man is above reproach, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, not accused of dissipation or rebellion.
Titus	Titus	56	1	7	For the overseer must be above reproach as God's steward, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not addicted to wine, not pugnacious, not fond of sordid gain,
Titus	Titus	56	1	8	but hospitable, loving what is good, sensible, just, devout, self-controlled,
Titus	Titus	56	1	9	holding fast the faithful word which is in accordance with the teaching, so that he will be able both to exhort in sound doctrine and to refute those who contradict.
Titus	Titus	56	1	10	For there are many rebellious men, empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,
Titus	Titus	56	1	11	who must be silenced because they are upsetting whole families, teaching things they should not teach for the sake of sordid gain.
Titus	Titus	56	1	12	One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, "Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons."
Titus	Titus	56	1	13	This testimony is true. For this reason reprove them severely so that they may be sound in the faith,
Titus	Titus	56	1	14	not paying attention to Jewish myths and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.
Titus	Titus	56	1	15	To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure, but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.
Titus	Titus	56	1	16	They profess to know God, but by their deeds they deny Him, being detestable and disobedient and worthless for any good deed.
Titus	Titus	56	2	1	But as for you, speak the things which are fitting for sound doctrine.
Titus	Titus	56	2	2	Older men are to be temperate, dignified, sensible, sound in faith, in love, in perseverance.
Titus	Titus	56	2	3	Older women likewise are to be reverent in their behavior, not malicious gossips nor enslaved to much wine, teaching what is good,
Titus	Titus	56	2	4	so that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,
Titus	Titus	56	2	5	to be sensible, pure, workers at home, kind, being subject to their own husbands, so that the word of God will not be dishonored.
Titus	Titus	56	2	6	Likewise urge the young men to be sensible;
Titus	Titus	56	2	7	in all things show yourself to be an example of good deeds, with purity in doctrine, dignified,
Titus	Titus	56	2	8	sound in speech which is beyond reproach, so that the opponent will be put to shame, having nothing bad to say about us.
Titus	Titus	56	2	9	Urge bondslaves to be subject to their own masters in everything, to be well-pleasing, not argumentative,
Titus	Titus	56	2	10	not pilfering, but showing all good faith so that they will adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in every respect.
Titus	Titus	56	2	11	For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,
Titus	Titus	56	2	12	instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live sensibly, righteously and godly in the present age,
Titus	Titus	56	2	13	looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus,
Titus	Titus	56	2	14	who gave Himself for us to redeem us from every lawless deed, and to purify for Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for good deeds.
Titus	Titus	56	2	15	These things speak and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one disregard you.
Titus	Titus	56	3	1	Remind them to be subject to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good deed,
Titus	Titus	56	3	2	to malign no one, to be peaceable, gentle, showing every consideration for all men.
Titus	Titus	56	3	3	For we also once were foolish ourselves, disobedient, deceived, enslaved to various lusts and pleasures, spending our life in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.
Titus	Titus	56	3	4	But when the kindness of God our Savior and His love for mankind appeared,
Titus	Titus	56	3	5	He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,
Titus	Titus	56	3	6	whom He poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior,
Titus	Titus	56	3	7	so that being justified by His grace we would be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
Titus	Titus	56	3	8	This is a trustworthy statement; and concerning these things I want you to speak confidently, so that those who have believed God will be careful to engage in good deeds. These things are good and profitable for men.
Titus	Titus	56	3	9	But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and strife and disputes about the Law, for they are unprofitable and worthless.
Titus	Titus	56	3	10	Reject a factious man after a first and second warning,
Titus	Titus	56	3	11	knowing that such a man is perverted and is sinning, being self-condemned.
Titus	Titus	56	3	12	When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, make every effort to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.
Titus	Titus	56	3	13	Diligently help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way so that nothing is lacking for them.
Titus	Titus	56	3	14	Our people must also learn to engage in good deeds to meet pressing needs, so that they will not be unfruitful.
Titus	Titus	56	3	15	All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all.
Philemon	Phmn	57	1	1	Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our beloved brother and fellow worker,
Philemon	Phmn	57	1	2	and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:
Philemon	Phmn	57	1	3	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Philemon	Phmn	57	1	4	I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,
Philemon	Phmn	57	1	5	because I hear of your love and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints;
Philemon	Phmn	57	1	6	and I pray that the fellowship of your faith may become effective through the knowledge of every good thing which is in you for Christ's sake.
Philemon	Phmn	57	1	7	For I have come to have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.
Philemon	Phmn	57	1	8	Therefore, though I have enough confidence in Christ to order you to do what is proper,
Philemon	Phmn	57	1	9	yet for love's sake I rather appeal to you--since I am such a person as Paul, the aged, and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus--
Philemon	Phmn	57	1	10	I appeal to you for my child Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my imprisonment,
Philemon	Phmn	57	1	11	who formerly was useless to you, but now is useful both to you and to me.
Philemon	Phmn	57	1	12	I have sent him back to you in person, that is, sending my very heart,
Philemon	Phmn	57	1	13	whom I wished to keep with me, so that on your behalf he might minister to me in my imprisonment for the gospel;
Philemon	Phmn	57	1	14	but without your consent I did not want to do anything, so that your goodness would not be, in effect, by compulsion but of your own free will.
Philemon	Phmn	57	1	15	For perhaps he was for this reason separated from you for a while, that you would have him back forever,
Philemon	Phmn	57	1	16	no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
Philemon	Phmn	57	1	17	If then you regard me a partner, accept him as you would me.
Philemon	Phmn	57	1	18	But if he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge that to my account;
Philemon	Phmn	57	1	19	I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand, I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self as well).
Philemon	Phmn	57	1	20	Yes, brother, let me benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.
Philemon	Phmn	57	1	21	Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, since I know that you will do even more than what I say.
Philemon	Phmn	57	1	22	At the same time also prepare me a lodging, for I hope that through your prayers I will be given to you.
Philemon	Phmn	57	1	23	Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,
Philemon	Phmn	57	1	24	as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow workers.
Philemon	Phmn	57	1	25	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
Hebrews	Heb	58	1	1	God, after He spoke long ago to the fathers in the prophets in many portions and in many ways,
Hebrews	Heb	58	1	2	in these last days has spoken to us in His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the world.
Hebrews	Heb	58	1	3	And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power. When He had made purification of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,
Hebrews	Heb	58	1	4	having become as much better than the angels, as He has inherited a more excellent name than they.
Hebrews	Heb	58	1	5	For to which of the angels did He ever say, "YOU ARE MY SON, TODAY I HAVE BEGOTTEN YOU"? And again, "I WILL BE A FATHER TO HIM AND HE SHALL BE A SON TO ME"?
Hebrews	Heb	58	1	6	And when He again brings the firstborn into the world, He says, "AND LET ALL THE ANGELS OF GOD WORSHIP HIM."
Hebrews	Heb	58	1	7	And of the angels He says, "WHO MAKES HIS ANGELS WINDS, AND HIS MINISTERS A FLAME OF FIRE."
Hebrews	Heb	58	1	8	But of the Son He says, "YOUR THRONE, O GOD, IS FOREVER AND EVER, AND THE RIGHTEOUS SCEPTER IS THE SCEPTER OF HIS KINGDOM.
Hebrews	Heb	58	1	9	"YOU HAVE LOVED RIGHTEOUSNESS AND HATED LAWLESSNESS; THEREFORE GOD, YOUR GOD, HAS ANOINTED YOU WITH THE OIL OF GLADNESS ABOVE YOUR COMPANIONS."
Hebrews	Heb	58	1	10	And, "YOU, LORD, IN THE BEGINNING LAID THE FOUNDATION OF THE EARTH, AND THE HEAVENS ARE THE WORKS OF YOUR HANDS;
Hebrews	Heb	58	1	11	THEY WILL PERISH, BUT YOU REMAIN; AND THEY ALL WILL BECOME OLD LIKE A GARMENT,
Hebrews	Heb	58	1	12	AND LIKE A MANTLE YOU WILL ROLL THEM UP; LIKE A GARMENT THEY WILL ALSO BE CHANGED. BUT YOU ARE THE SAME, AND YOUR YEARS WILL NOT COME TO AN END."
Hebrews	Heb	58	1	13	But to which of the angels has He ever said, "SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND, UNTIL I MAKE YOUR ENEMIES A FOOTSTOOL FOR YOUR FEET"?
Hebrews	Heb	58	1	14	Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out to render service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation?
Hebrews	Heb	58	2	1	For this reason we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away from it.
Hebrews	Heb	58	2	2	For if the word spoken through angels proved unalterable, and every transgression and disobedience received a just penalty,
Hebrews	Heb	58	2	3	how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation? After it was at the first spoken through the Lord, it was confirmed to us by those who heard,
Hebrews	Heb	58	2	4	God also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders and by various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit according to His own will.
Hebrews	Heb	58	2	5	For He did not subject to angels the world to come, concerning which we are speaking.
Hebrews	Heb	58	2	6	But one has testified somewhere, saying, "WHAT IS MAN, THAT YOU REMEMBER HIM? OR THE SON OF MAN, THAT YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HIM?
Hebrews	Heb	58	2	7	"YOU HAVE MADE HIM FOR A LITTLE WHILE LOWER THAN THE ANGELS; YOU HAVE CROWNED HIM WITH GLORY AND HONOR, AND HAVE APPOINTED HIM OVER THE WORKS OF YOUR HANDS;
Hebrews	Heb	58	2	8	YOU HAVE PUT ALL THINGS IN SUBJECTION UNDER HIS FEET." For in subjecting all things to him, He left nothing that is not subject to him. But now we do not yet see all things subjected to him.
Hebrews	Heb	58	2	9	But we do see Him who was made for a little while lower than the angels, namely, Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, so that by the grace of God He might taste death for everyone.
Hebrews	Heb	58	2	10	For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the author of their salvation through sufferings.
Hebrews	Heb	58	2	11	For both He who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one Father; for which reason He is not ashamed to call them brethren,
Hebrews	Heb	58	2	12	saying, "I WILL PROCLAIM YOUR NAME TO MY BRETHREN, IN THE MIDST OF THE CONGREGATION I WILL SING YOUR PRAISE."
Hebrews	Heb	58	2	13	And again, "I WILL PUT MY TRUST IN HIM." And again, "BEHOLD, I AND THE CHILDREN WHOM GOD HAS GIVEN ME."
Hebrews	Heb	58	2	14	Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, He Himself likewise also partook of the same, that through death He might render powerless him who had the power of death, that is, the devil,
Hebrews	Heb	58	2	15	and might free those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives.
Hebrews	Heb	58	2	16	For assuredly He does not give help to angels, but He gives help to the descendant of Abraham.
Hebrews	Heb	58	2	17	Therefore, He had to be made like His brethren in all things, so that He might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.
Hebrews	Heb	58	2	18	For since He Himself was tempted in that which He has suffered, He is able to come to the aid of those who are tempted.
Hebrews	Heb	58	3	1	Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest of our confession;
Hebrews	Heb	58	3	2	He was faithful to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also was in all His house.
Hebrews	Heb	58	3	3	For He has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by just so much as the builder of the house has more honor than the house.
Hebrews	Heb	58	3	4	For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.
Hebrews	Heb	58	3	5	Now Moses was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken later;
Hebrews	Heb	58	3	6	but Christ was faithful as a Son over His house--whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the boast of our hope firm until the end.
Hebrews	Heb	58	3	7	Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says, "TODAY IF YOU HEAR HIS VOICE,
Hebrews	Heb	58	3	8	DO NOT HARDEN YOUR HEARTS AS WHEN THEY PROVOKED ME, AS IN THE DAY OF TRIAL IN THE WILDERNESS,
Hebrews	Heb	58	3	9	WHERE YOUR FATHERS TRIED Me BY TESTING Me, AND SAW MY WORKS FOR FORTY YEARS.
Hebrews	Heb	58	3	10	"THEREFORE I WAS ANGRY WITH THIS GENERATION, AND SAID, 'THEY ALWAYS GO ASTRAY IN THEIR HEART, AND THEY DID NOT KNOW MY WAYS';
Hebrews	Heb	58	3	11	AS I SWORE IN MY WRATH, 'THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST.'"
Hebrews	Heb	58	3	12	Take care, brethren, that there not be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart that falls away from the living God.
Hebrews	Heb	58	3	13	But encourage one another day after day, as long as it is still called "Today," so that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
Hebrews	Heb	58	3	14	For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our assurance firm until the end,
Hebrews	Heb	58	3	15	while it is said, "TODAY IF YOU HEAR HIS VOICE, DO NOT HARDEN YOUR HEARTS, AS WHEN THEY PROVOKED ME."
Hebrews	Heb	58	3	16	For who provoked Him when they had heard? Indeed, did not all those who came out of Egypt led by Moses?
Hebrews	Heb	58	3	17	And with whom was He angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?
Hebrews	Heb	58	3	18	And to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest, but to those who were disobedient?
Hebrews	Heb	58	3	19	So we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief.
Hebrews	Heb	58	4	1	Therefore, let us fear if, while a promise remains of entering His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short of it.
Hebrews	Heb	58	4	2	For indeed we have had good news preached to us, just as they also; but the word they heard did not profit them, because it was not united by faith in those who heard.
Hebrews	Heb	58	4	3	For we who have believed enter that rest, just as He has said, "AS I SWORE IN MY WRATH, THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST," although His works were finished from the foundation of the world.
Hebrews	Heb	58	4	4	For He has said somewhere concerning the seventh day: "AND GOD RESTED ON THE SEVENTH DAY FROM ALL HIS WORKS";
Hebrews	Heb	58	4	5	and again in this passage, "THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST."
Hebrews	Heb	58	4	6	Therefore, since it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly had good news preached to them failed to enter because of disobedience,
Hebrews	Heb	58	4	7	He again fixes a certain day, "Today," saying through David after so long a time just as has been said before, "TODAY IF YOU HEAR HIS VOICE, DO NOT HARDEN YOUR HEARTS."
Hebrews	Heb	58	4	8	For if Joshua had given them rest, He would not have spoken of another day after that.
Hebrews	Heb	58	4	9	So there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God.
Hebrews	Heb	58	4	10	For the one who has entered His rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from His.
Hebrews	Heb	58	4	11	Therefore let us be diligent to enter that rest, so that no one will fall, through following the same example of disobedience.
Hebrews	Heb	58	4	12	For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
Hebrews	Heb	58	4	13	And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.
Hebrews	Heb	58	4	14	Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.
Hebrews	Heb	58	4	15	For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin.
Hebrews	Heb	58	4	16	Therefore let us draw near with confidence to the throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
Hebrews	Heb	58	5	1	For every high priest taken from among men is appointed on behalf of men in things pertaining to God, in order to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins;
Hebrews	Heb	58	5	2	he can deal gently with the ignorant and misguided, since he himself also is beset with weakness;
Hebrews	Heb	58	5	3	and because of it he is obligated to offer sacrifices for sins, as for the people, so also for himself.
Hebrews	Heb	58	5	4	And no one takes the honor to himself, but receives it when he is called by God, even as Aaron was.
Hebrews	Heb	58	5	5	So also Christ did not glorify Himself so as to become a high priest, but He who said to Him, "YOU ARE MY SON, TODAY I HAVE BEGOTTEN YOU";
Hebrews	Heb	58	5	6	just as He says also in another passage, "YOU ARE A PRIEST FOREVER ACCORDING TO THE ORDER OF MELCHIZEDEK."
Hebrews	Heb	58	5	7	In the days of His flesh, He offered up both prayers and supplications with loud crying and tears to the One able to save Him from death, and He was heard because of His piety.
Hebrews	Heb	58	5	8	Although He was a Son, He learned obedience from the things which He suffered.
Hebrews	Heb	58	5	9	And having been made perfect, He became to all those who obey Him the source of eternal salvation,
Hebrews	Heb	58	5	10	being designated by God as a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.
Hebrews	Heb	58	5	11	Concerning him we have much to say, and it is hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing.
Hebrews	Heb	58	5	12	For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you the elementary principles of the oracles of God, and you have come to need milk and not solid food.
Hebrews	Heb	58	5	13	For everyone who partakes only of milk is not accustomed to the word of righteousness, for he is an infant.
Hebrews	Heb	58	5	14	But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have their senses trained to discern good and evil.
Hebrews	Heb	58	6	1	Therefore leaving the elementary teaching about the Christ, let us press on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God,
Hebrews	Heb	58	6	2	of instruction about washings and laying on of hands, and the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment.
Hebrews	Heb	58	6	3	And this we will do, if God permits.
Hebrews	Heb	58	6	4	For in the case of those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit,
Hebrews	Heb	58	6	5	and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come,
Hebrews	Heb	58	6	6	and then have fallen away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance, since they again crucify to themselves the Son of God and put Him to open shame.
Hebrews	Heb	58	6	7	For ground that drinks the rain which often falls on it and brings forth vegetation useful to those for whose sake it is also tilled, receives a blessing from God;
Hebrews	Heb	58	6	8	but if it yields thorns and thistles, it is worthless and close to being cursed, and it ends up being burned.
Hebrews	Heb	58	6	9	But, beloved, we are convinced of better things concerning you, and things that accompany salvation, though we are speaking in this way.
Hebrews	Heb	58	6	10	For God is not unjust so as to forget your work and the love which you have shown toward His name, in having ministered and in still ministering to the saints.
Hebrews	Heb	58	6	11	And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence so as to realize the full assurance of hope until the end,
Hebrews	Heb	58	6	12	so that you will not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
Hebrews	Heb	58	6	13	For when God made the promise to Abraham, since He could swear by no one greater, He swore by Himself,
Hebrews	Heb	58	6	14	saying, "I WILL SURELY BLESS YOU AND I WILL SURELY MULTIPLY YOU."
Hebrews	Heb	58	6	15	And so, having patiently waited, he obtained the promise.
Hebrews	Heb	58	6	16	For men swear by one greater than themselves, and with them an oath given as confirmation is an end of every dispute.
Hebrews	Heb	58	6	17	In the same way God, desiring even more to show to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of His purpose, interposed with an oath,
Hebrews	Heb	58	6	18	so that by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have taken refuge would have strong encouragement to take hold of the hope set before us.
Hebrews	Heb	58	6	19	This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and steadfast and one which enters within the veil,
Hebrews	Heb	58	6	20	where Jesus has entered as a forerunner for us, having become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.
Hebrews	Heb	58	7	1	For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,
Hebrews	Heb	58	7	2	to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all the spoils, was first of all, by the translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace.
Hebrews	Heb	58	7	3	Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually.
Hebrews	Heb	58	7	4	Now observe how great this man was to whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth of the choicest spoils.
Hebrews	Heb	58	7	5	And those indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest's office have commandment in the Law to collect a tenth from the people, that is, from their brethren, although these are descended from Abraham.
Hebrews	Heb	58	7	6	But the one whose genealogy is not traced from them collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises.
Hebrews	Heb	58	7	7	But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater.
Hebrews	Heb	58	7	8	In this case mortal men receive tithes, but in that case one receives them, of whom it is witnessed that he lives on.
Hebrews	Heb	58	7	9	And, so to speak, through Abraham even Levi, who received tithes, paid tithes,
Hebrews	Heb	58	7	10	for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.
Hebrews	Heb	58	7	11	Now if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood (for on the basis of it the people received the Law), what further need was there for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not be designated according to the order of Aaron?
Hebrews	Heb	58	7	12	For when the priesthood is changed, of necessity there takes place a change of law also.
Hebrews	Heb	58	7	13	For the one concerning whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar.
Hebrews	Heb	58	7	14	For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, a tribe with reference to which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests.
Hebrews	Heb	58	7	15	And this is clearer still, if another priest arises according to the likeness of Melchizedek,
Hebrews	Heb	58	7	16	who has become such not on the basis of a law of physical requirement, but according to the power of an indestructible life.
Hebrews	Heb	58	7	17	For it is attested of Him, "YOU ARE A PRIEST FOREVER ACCORDING TO THE ORDER OF MELCHIZEDEK."
Hebrews	Heb	58	7	18	For, on the one hand, there is a setting aside of a former commandment because of its weakness and uselessness
Hebrews	Heb	58	7	19	(for the Law made nothing perfect), and on the other hand there is a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.
Hebrews	Heb	58	7	20	And inasmuch as it was not without an oath
Hebrews	Heb	58	7	21	(for they indeed became priests without an oath, but He with an oath through the One who said to Him, "THE LORD HAS SWORN AND WILL NOT CHANGE HIS MIND, 'YOU ARE A PRIEST FOREVER'");
Hebrews	Heb	58	7	22	so much the more also Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.
Hebrews	Heb	58	7	23	The former priests, on the one hand, existed in greater numbers because they were prevented by death from continuing,
Hebrews	Heb	58	7	24	but Jesus, on the other hand, because He continues forever, holds His priesthood permanently.
Hebrews	Heb	58	7	25	Therefore He is able also to save forever those who draw near to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.
Hebrews	Heb	58	7	26	For it was fitting for us to have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners and exalted above the heavens;
Hebrews	Heb	58	7	27	who does not need daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the sins of the people, because this He did once for all when He offered up Himself.
Hebrews	Heb	58	7	28	For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak, but the word of the oath, which came after the Law, appoints a Son, made perfect forever.
Hebrews	Heb	58	8	1	Now the main point in what has been said is this: we have such a high priest, who has taken His seat at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,
Hebrews	Heb	58	8	2	a minister in the sanctuary and in the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.
Hebrews	Heb	58	8	3	For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; so it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer.
Hebrews	Heb	58	8	4	Now if He were on earth, He would not be a priest at all, since there are those who offer the gifts according to the Law;
Hebrews	Heb	58	8	5	who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses was warned by God when he was about to erect the tabernacle; for, "SEE," He says, "THAT YOU MAKE all things ACCORDING TO THE PATTERN WHICH WAS SHOWN YOU ON THE MOUNTAIN."
Hebrews	Heb	58	8	6	But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, by as much as He is also the mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted on better promises.
Hebrews	Heb	58	8	7	For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion sought for a second.
Hebrews	Heb	58	8	8	For finding fault with them, He says, "BEHOLD, DAYS ARE COMING, SAYS THE LORD, WHEN I WILL EFFECT A NEW COVENANT WITH THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AND WITH THE HOUSE OF JUDAH;
Hebrews	Heb	58	8	9	NOT LIKE THE COVENANT WHICH I MADE WITH THEIR FATHERS ON THE DAY WHEN I TOOK THEM BY THE HAND TO LEAD THEM OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT; FOR THEY DID NOT CONTINUE IN MY COVENANT, AND I DID NOT CARE FOR THEM, SAYS THE LORD.
Hebrews	Heb	58	8	10	"FOR THIS IS THE COVENANT THAT I WILL MAKE WITH THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AFTER THOSE DAYS, SAYS THE LORD: I WILL PUT MY LAWS INTO THEIR MINDS, AND I WILL WRITE THEM ON THEIR HEARTS. AND I WILL BE THEIR GOD, AND THEY SHALL BE MY PEOPLE.
Hebrews	Heb	58	8	11	"AND THEY SHALL NOT TEACH EVERYONE HIS FELLOW CITIZEN, AND EVERYONE HIS BROTHER, SAYING, 'KNOW THE LORD,' FOR ALL WILL KNOW ME, FROM THE LEAST TO THE GREATEST OF THEM.
Hebrews	Heb	58	8	12	"FOR I WILL BE MERCIFUL TO THEIR INIQUITIES, AND I WILL REMEMBER THEIR SINS NO MORE."
Hebrews	Heb	58	8	13	When He said, "A new covenant," He has made the first obsolete. But whatever is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to disappear.
Hebrews	Heb	58	9	1	Now even the first covenant had regulations of divine worship and the earthly sanctuary.
Hebrews	Heb	58	9	2	For there was a tabernacle prepared, the outer one, in which were the lampstand and the table and the sacred bread; this is called the holy place.
Hebrews	Heb	58	9	3	Behind the second veil there was a tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies,
Hebrews	Heb	58	9	4	having a golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which was a golden jar holding the manna, and Aaron's rod which budded, and the tables of the covenant;
Hebrews	Heb	58	9	5	and above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat; but of these things we cannot now speak in detail.
Hebrews	Heb	58	9	6	Now when these things have been so prepared, the priests are continually entering the outer tabernacle performing the divine worship,
Hebrews	Heb	58	9	7	but into the second, only the high priest enters once a year, not without taking blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins of the people committed in ignorance.
Hebrews	Heb	58	9	8	The Holy Spirit is signifying this, that the way into the holy place has not yet been disclosed while the outer tabernacle is still standing,
Hebrews	Heb	58	9	9	which is a symbol for the present time. Accordingly both gifts and sacrifices are offered which cannot make the worshiper perfect in conscience,
Hebrews	Heb	58	9	10	since they relate only to food and drink and various washings, regulations for the body imposed until a time of reformation.
Hebrews	Heb	58	9	11	But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things to come, He entered through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation;
Hebrews	Heb	58	9	12	and not through the blood of goats and calves, but through His own blood, He entered the holy place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption.
Hebrews	Heb	58	9	13	For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled sanctify for the cleansing of the flesh,
Hebrews	Heb	58	9	14	how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
Hebrews	Heb	58	9	15	For this reason He is the mediator of a new covenant, so that, since a death has taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were committed under the first covenant, those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.
Hebrews	Heb	58	9	16	For where a covenant is, there must of necessity be the death of the one who made it.
Hebrews	Heb	58	9	17	For a covenant is valid only when men are dead, for it is never in force while the one who made it lives.
Hebrews	Heb	58	9	18	Therefore even the first covenant was not inaugurated without blood.
Hebrews	Heb	58	9	19	For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the Law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,
Hebrews	Heb	58	9	20	saying, "THIS IS THE BLOOD OF THE COVENANT WHICH GOD COMMANDED YOU."
Hebrews	Heb	58	9	21	And in the same way he sprinkled both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry with the blood.
Hebrews	Heb	58	9	22	And according to the Law, one may almost say, all things are cleansed with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.
Hebrews	Heb	58	9	23	Therefore it was necessary for the copies of the things in the heavens to be cleansed with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
Hebrews	Heb	58	9	24	For Christ did not enter a holy place made with hands, a mere copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us;
Hebrews	Heb	58	9	25	nor was it that He would offer Himself often, as the high priest enters the holy place year by year with blood that is not his own.
Hebrews	Heb	58	9	26	Otherwise, He would have needed to suffer often since the foundation of the world; but now once at the consummation of the ages He has been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.
Hebrews	Heb	58	9	27	And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once and after this comes judgment,
Hebrews	Heb	58	9	28	so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time for salvation without reference to sin, to those who eagerly await Him.
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	1	For the Law, since it has only a shadow of the good things to come and not the very form of things, can never, by the same sacrifices which they offer continually year by year, make perfect those who draw near.
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	2	Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, because the worshipers, having once been cleansed, would no longer have had consciousness of sins?
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	3	But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year by year.
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	4	For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	5	Therefore, when He comes into the world, He says, "SACRIFICE AND OFFERING YOU HAVE NOT DESIRED, BUT A BODY YOU HAVE PREPARED FOR ME;
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	6	IN WHOLE BURNT OFFERINGS AND sacrifices FOR SIN YOU HAVE TAKEN NO PLEASURE.
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	7	"THEN I SAID, 'BEHOLD, I HAVE COME (IN THE SCROLL OF THE BOOK IT IS WRITTEN OF ME) TO DO YOUR WILL, O GOD.'"
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	8	After saying above, "SACRIFICES AND OFFERINGS AND WHOLE BURNT OFFERINGS AND sacrifices FOR SIN YOU HAVE NOT DESIRED, NOR HAVE YOU TAKEN PLEASURE in them" (which are offered according to the Law),
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	9	then He said, "BEHOLD, I HAVE COME TO DO YOUR WILL." He takes away the first in order to establish the second.
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	10	By this will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	11	Every priest stands daily ministering and offering time after time the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins;
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	12	but He, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, SAT DOWN AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD,
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	13	waiting from that time onward UNTIL HIS ENEMIES BE MADE A FOOTSTOOL FOR HIS FEET.
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	14	For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified.
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	15	And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us; for after saying,
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	16	"THIS IS THE COVENANT THAT I WILL MAKE WITH THEM AFTER THOSE DAYS, SAYS THE LORD: I WILL PUT MY LAWS UPON THEIR HEART, AND ON THEIR MIND I WILL WRITE THEM," He then says,
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	17	"AND THEIR SINS AND THEIR LAWLESS DEEDS I WILL REMEMBER NO MORE."
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	18	Now where there is forgiveness of these things, there is no longer any offering for sin.
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	19	Therefore, brethren, since we have confidence to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus,
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	20	by a new and living way which He inaugurated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh,
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	21	and since we have a great priest over the house of God,
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	22	let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	23	Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful;
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	24	and let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds,
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	25	not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing near.
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	26	For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	27	but a terrifying expectation of judgment and THE FURY OF A FIRE WHICH WILL CONSUME THE ADVERSARIES.
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	28	Anyone who has set aside the Law of Moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	29	How much severer punishment do you think he will deserve who has trampled under foot the Son of God, and has regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	30	For we know Him who said, "VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL REPAY." And again, "THE LORD WILL JUDGE HIS PEOPLE."
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	31	It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	32	But remember the former days, when, after being enlightened, you endured a great conflict of sufferings,
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	33	partly by being made a public spectacle through reproaches and tribulations, and partly by becoming sharers with those who were so treated.
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	34	For you showed sympathy to the prisoners and accepted joyfully the seizure of your property, knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and a lasting one.
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	35	Therefore, do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward.
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	36	For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God, you may receive what was promised.
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	37	FOR YET IN A VERY LITTLE WHILE, HE WHO IS COMING WILL COME, AND WILL NOT DELAY.
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	38	BUT MY RIGHTEOUS ONE SHALL LIVE BY FAITH; AND IF HE SHRINKS BACK, MY SOUL HAS NO PLEASURE IN HIM.
Hebrews	Heb	58	10	39	But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction, but of those who have faith to the preserving of the soul.
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	1	Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	2	For by it the men of old gained approval.
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	3	By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things which are visible.
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	4	By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained the testimony that he was righteous, God testifying about his gifts, and through faith, though he is dead, he still speaks.
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	5	By faith Enoch was taken up so that he would not see death; AND HE WAS NOT FOUND BECAUSE GOD TOOK HIM UP; for he obtained the witness that before his being taken up he was pleasing to God.
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	6	And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him.
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	7	By faith Noah, being warned by God about things not yet seen, in reverence prepared an ark for the salvation of his household, by which he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	8	By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going.
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	9	By faith he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same promise;
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	10	for he was looking for the city which has foundations, whose architect and builder is God.
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	11	By faith even Sarah herself received ability to conceive, even beyond the proper time of life, since she considered Him faithful who had promised.
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	12	Therefore there was born even of one man, and him as good as dead at that, as many descendants AS THE STARS OF HEAVEN IN NUMBER, AND INNUMERABLE AS THE SAND WHICH IS BY THE SEASHORE.
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	13	All these died in faith, without receiving the promises, but having seen them and having welcomed them from a distance, and having confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth.
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	14	For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own.
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	15	And indeed if they had been thinking of that country from which they went out, they would have had opportunity to return.
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	16	But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for He has prepared a city for them.
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	17	By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was offering up his only begotten son;
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	18	it was he to whom it was said, "IN ISAAC YOUR DESCENDANTS SHALL BE CALLED."
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	19	He considered that God is able to raise people even from the dead, from which he also received him back as a type.
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	20	By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even regarding things to come.
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	21	By faith Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff.
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	22	By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the exodus of the sons of Israel, and gave orders concerning his bones.
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	23	By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king's edict.
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	24	By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	25	choosing rather to endure ill-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin,
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	26	considering the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he was looking to the reward.
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	27	By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing Him who is unseen.
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	28	By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that he who destroyed the firstborn would not touch them.
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	29	By faith they passed through the Red Sea as though they were passing through dry land; and the Egyptians, when they attempted it, were drowned.
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	30	By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days.
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	31	By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish along with those who were disobedient, after she had welcomed the spies in peace.
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	32	And what more shall I say? For time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets,
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	33	who by faith conquered kingdoms, performed acts of righteousness, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions,
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	34	quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight.
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	35	Women received back their dead by resurrection; and others were tortured, not accepting their release, so that they might obtain a better resurrection;
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	36	and others experienced mockings and scourgings, yes, also chains and imprisonment.
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	37	They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were tempted, they were put to death with the sword; they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	38	(men of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains and caves and holes in the ground.
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	39	And all these, having gained approval through their faith, did not receive what was promised,
Hebrews	Heb	58	11	40	because God had provided something better for us, so that apart from us they would not be made perfect.
Hebrews	Heb	58	12	1	Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,
Hebrews	Heb	58	12	2	fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
Hebrews	Heb	58	12	3	For consider Him who has endured such hostility by sinners against Himself, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.
Hebrews	Heb	58	12	4	You have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood in your striving against sin;
Hebrews	Heb	58	12	5	and you have forgotten the exhortation which is addressed to you as sons, "MY SON, DO NOT REGARD LIGHTLY THE DISCIPLINE OF THE LORD, NOR FAINT WHEN YOU ARE REPROVED BY HIM;
Hebrews	Heb	58	12	6	FOR THOSE WHOM THE LORD LOVES HE DISCIPLINES, AND HE SCOURGES EVERY SON WHOM HE RECEIVES."
Hebrews	Heb	58	12	7	It is for discipline that you endure; God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline?
Hebrews	Heb	58	12	8	But if you are without discipline, of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate children and not sons.
Hebrews	Heb	58	12	9	Furthermore, we had earthly fathers to discipline us, and we respected them; shall we not much rather be subject to the Father of spirits, and live?
Hebrews	Heb	58	12	10	For they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them, but He disciplines us for our good, so that we may share His holiness.
Hebrews	Heb	58	12	11	All discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful, but sorrowful; yet to those who have been trained by it, afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness.
Hebrews	Heb	58	12	12	Therefore, strengthen the hands that are weak and the knees that are feeble,
Hebrews	Heb	58	12	13	and make straight paths for your feet, so that the limb which is lame may not be put out of joint, but rather be healed.
Hebrews	Heb	58	12	14	Pursue peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no one will see the Lord.
Hebrews	Heb	58	12	15	See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God; that no root of bitterness springing up causes trouble, and by it many be defiled;
Hebrews	Heb	58	12	16	that there be no immoral or godless person like Esau, who sold his own birthright for a single meal.
Hebrews	Heb	58	12	17	For you know that even afterwards, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for repentance, though he sought for it with tears.
Hebrews	Heb	58	12	18	For you have not come to a mountain that can be touched and to a blazing fire, and to darkness and gloom and whirlwind,
Hebrews	Heb	58	12	19	and to the blast of a trumpet and the sound of words which sound was such that those who heard begged that no further word be spoken to them.
Hebrews	Heb	58	12	20	For they could not bear the command, "IF EVEN A BEAST TOUCHES THE MOUNTAIN, IT WILL BE STONED."
Hebrews	Heb	58	12	21	And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, "I AM FULL OF FEAR and trembling."
Hebrews	Heb	58	12	22	But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels,
Hebrews	Heb	58	12	23	to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the Judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect,
Hebrews	Heb	58	12	24	and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood, which speaks better than the blood of Abel.
Hebrews	Heb	58	12	25	See to it that you do not refuse Him who is speaking. For if those did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, much less will we escape who turn away from Him who warns from heaven.
Hebrews	Heb	58	12	26	And His voice shook the earth then, but now He has promised, saying, "YET ONCE MORE I WILL SHAKE NOT ONLY THE EARTH, BUT ALSO THE HEAVEN."
Hebrews	Heb	58	12	27	This expression, "Yet once more," denotes the removing of those things which can be shaken, as of created things, so that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.
Hebrews	Heb	58	12	28	Therefore, since we receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us show gratitude, by which we may offer to God an acceptable service with reverence and awe;
Hebrews	Heb	58	12	29	for our God is a consuming fire.
Hebrews	Heb	58	13	1	Let love of the brethren continue.
Hebrews	Heb	58	13	2	Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for by this some have entertained angels without knowing it.
Hebrews	Heb	58	13	3	Remember the prisoners, as though in prison with them, and those who are ill-treated, since you yourselves also are in the body.
Hebrews	Heb	58	13	4	Marriage is to be held in honor among all, and the marriage bed is to be undefiled; for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.
Hebrews	Heb	58	13	5	Make sure that your character is free from the love of money, being content with what you have; for He Himself has said, "I WILL NEVER DESERT YOU, NOR WILL I EVER FORSAKE YOU,"
Hebrews	Heb	58	13	6	so that we confidently say, "THE LORD IS MY HELPER, I WILL NOT BE AFRAID. WHAT WILL MAN DO TO ME?"
Hebrews	Heb	58	13	7	Remember those who led you, who spoke the word of God to you; and considering the result of their conduct, imitate their faith.
Hebrews	Heb	58	13	8	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.
Hebrews	Heb	58	13	9	Do not be carried away by varied and strange teachings; for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace, not by foods, through which those who were so occupied were not benefited.
Hebrews	Heb	58	13	10	We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat.
Hebrews	Heb	58	13	11	For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin, are burned outside the camp.
Hebrews	Heb	58	13	12	Therefore Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood, suffered outside the gate.
Hebrews	Heb	58	13	13	So, let us go out to Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach.
Hebrews	Heb	58	13	14	For here we do not have a lasting city, but we are seeking the city which is to come.
Hebrews	Heb	58	13	15	Through Him then, let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that give thanks to His name.
Hebrews	Heb	58	13	16	And do not neglect doing good and sharing, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.
Hebrews	Heb	58	13	17	Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with grief, for this would be unprofitable for you.
Hebrews	Heb	58	13	18	Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a good conscience, desiring to conduct ourselves honorably in all things.
Hebrews	Heb	58	13	19	And I urge you all the more to do this, so that I may be restored to you the sooner.
Hebrews	Heb	58	13	20	Now the God of peace, who brought up from the dead the great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the eternal covenant, even Jesus our Lord,
Hebrews	Heb	58	13	21	equip you in every good thing to do His will, working in us that which is pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
Hebrews	Heb	58	13	22	But I urge you, brethren, bear with this word of exhortation, for I have written to you briefly.
Hebrews	Heb	58	13	23	Take notice that our brother Timothy has been released, with whom, if he comes soon, I will see you.
Hebrews	Heb	58	13	24	Greet all of your leaders and all the saints. Those from Italy greet you.
Hebrews	Heb	58	13	25	Grace be with you all.
James	Jas	59	1	1	James, a bond-servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes who are dispersed abroad: Greetings.
James	Jas	59	1	2	Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials,
James	Jas	59	1	3	knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance.
James	Jas	59	1	4	And let endurance have its perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.
James	Jas	59	1	5	But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him.
James	Jas	59	1	6	But he must ask in faith without any doubting, for the one who doubts is like the surf of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind.
James	Jas	59	1	7	For that man ought not to expect that he will receive anything from the Lord,
James	Jas	59	1	8	being a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.
James	Jas	59	1	9	But the brother of humble circumstances is to glory in his high position;
James	Jas	59	1	10	and the rich man is to glory in his humiliation, because like flowering grass he will pass away.
James	Jas	59	1	11	For the sun rises with a scorching wind and withers the grass; and its flower falls off and the beauty of its appearance is destroyed; so too the rich man in the midst of his pursuits will fade away.
James	Jas	59	1	12	Blessed is a man who perseveres under trial; for once he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him.
James	Jas	59	1	13	Let no one say when he is tempted, "I am being tempted by God"; for God cannot be tempted by evil, and He Himself does not tempt anyone.
James	Jas	59	1	14	But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust.
James	Jas	59	1	15	Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and when sin is accomplished, it brings forth death.
James	Jas	59	1	16	Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren.
James	Jas	59	1	17	Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shifting shadow.
James	Jas	59	1	18	In the exercise of His will He brought us forth by the word of truth, so that we would be a kind of first fruits among His creatures.
James	Jas	59	1	19	This you know, my beloved brethren. But everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak and slow to anger;
James	Jas	59	1	20	for the anger of man does not achieve the righteousness of God.
James	Jas	59	1	21	Therefore, putting aside all filthiness and all that remains of wickedness, in humility receive the word implanted, which is able to save your souls.
James	Jas	59	1	22	But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not merely hearers who delude themselves.
James	Jas	59	1	23	For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror;
James	Jas	59	1	24	for once he has looked at himself and gone away, he has immediately forgotten what kind of person he was.
James	Jas	59	1	25	But one who looks intently at the perfect law, the law of liberty, and abides by it, not having become a forgetful hearer but an effectual doer, this man will be blessed in what he does.
James	Jas	59	1	26	If anyone thinks himself to be religious, and yet does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, this man's religion is worthless.
James	Jas	59	1	27	Pure and undefiled religion in the sight of our God and Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself unstained by the world.
James	Jas	59	2	1	My brethren, do not hold your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with an attitude of personal favoritism.
James	Jas	59	2	2	For if a man comes into your assembly with a gold ring and dressed in fine clothes, and there also comes in a poor man in dirty clothes,
James	Jas	59	2	3	and you pay special attention to the one who is wearing the fine clothes, and say, "You sit here in a good place," and you say to the poor man, "You stand over there, or sit down by my footstool,"
James	Jas	59	2	4	have you not made distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil motives?
James	Jas	59	2	5	Listen, my beloved brethren: did not God choose the poor of this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those who love Him?
James	Jas	59	2	6	But you have dishonored the poor man. Is it not the rich who oppress you and personally drag you into court?
James	Jas	59	2	7	Do they not blaspheme the fair name by which you have been called?
James	Jas	59	2	8	If, however, you are fulfilling the royal law according to the Scripture, "YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF," you are doing well.
James	Jas	59	2	9	But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.
James	Jas	59	2	10	For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of all.
James	Jas	59	2	11	For He who said, "DO NOT COMMIT ADULTERY," also said, "DO NOT COMMIT MURDER." Now if you do not commit adultery, but do commit murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.
James	Jas	59	2	12	So speak and so act as those who are to be judged by the law of liberty.
James	Jas	59	2	13	For judgment will be merciless to one who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment.
James	Jas	59	2	14	What use is it, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but he has no works? Can that faith save him?
James	Jas	59	2	15	If a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food,
James	Jas	59	2	16	and one of you says to them, "Go in peace, be warmed and be filled," and yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body, what use is that?
James	Jas	59	2	17	Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead, being by itself.
James	Jas	59	2	18	But someone may well say, "You have faith and I have works; show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works."
James	Jas	59	2	19	You believe that God is one. You do well; the demons also believe, and shudder.
James	Jas	59	2	20	But are you willing to recognize, you foolish fellow, that faith without works is useless?
James	Jas	59	2	21	Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?
James	Jas	59	2	22	You see that faith was working with his works, and as a result of the works, faith was perfected;
James	Jas	59	2	23	and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, "AND ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS RECKONED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS," and he was called the friend of God.
James	Jas	59	2	24	You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone.
James	Jas	59	2	25	In the same way, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?
James	Jas	59	2	26	For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.
James	Jas	59	3	1	Let not many of you become teachers, my brethren, knowing that as such we will incur a stricter judgment.
James	Jas	59	3	2	For we all stumble in many ways. If anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body as well.
James	Jas	59	3	3	Now if we put the bits into the horses' mouths so that they will obey us, we direct their entire body as well.
James	Jas	59	3	4	Look at the ships also, though they are so great and are driven by strong winds, are still directed by a very small rudder wherever the inclination of the pilot desires.
James	Jas	59	3	5	So also the tongue is a small part of the body, and yet it boasts of great things. See how great a forest is set aflame by such a small fire!
James	Jas	59	3	6	And the tongue is a fire, the very world of iniquity; the tongue is set among our members as that which defiles the entire body, and sets on fire the course of our life, and is set on fire by hell.
James	Jas	59	3	7	For every species of beasts and birds, of reptiles and creatures of the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by the human race.
James	Jas	59	3	8	But no one can tame the tongue; it is a restless evil and full of deadly poison.
James	Jas	59	3	9	With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the likeness of God;
James	Jas	59	3	10	from the same mouth come both blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not to be this way.
James	Jas	59	3	11	Does a fountain send out from the same opening both fresh and bitter water?
James	Jas	59	3	12	Can a fig tree, my brethren, produce olives, or a vine produce figs? Nor can salt water produce fresh.
James	Jas	59	3	13	Who among you is wise and understanding? Let him show by his good behavior his deeds in the gentleness of wisdom.
James	Jas	59	3	14	But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not be arrogant and so lie against the truth.
James	Jas	59	3	15	This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, natural, demonic.
James	Jas	59	3	16	For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every evil thing.
James	Jas	59	3	17	But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering, without hypocrisy.
James	Jas	59	3	18	And the seed whose fruit is righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.
James	Jas	59	4	1	What is the source of quarrels and conflicts among you? Is not the source your pleasures that wage war in your members?
James	Jas	59	4	2	You lust and do not have; so you commit murder. You are envious and cannot obtain; so you fight and quarrel. You do not have because you do not ask.
James	Jas	59	4	3	You ask and do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your pleasures.
James	Jas	59	4	4	You adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.
James	Jas	59	4	5	Or do you think that the Scripture speaks to no purpose: "He jealously desires the Spirit which He has made to dwell in us"?
James	Jas	59	4	6	But He gives a greater grace. Therefore it says, "GOD IS OPPOSED TO THE PROUD, BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE."
James	Jas	59	4	7	Submit therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.
James	Jas	59	4	8	Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded.
James	Jas	59	4	9	Be miserable and mourn and weep; let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy to gloom.
James	Jas	59	4	10	Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord, and He will exalt you.
James	Jas	59	4	11	Do not speak against one another, brethren. He who speaks against a brother or judges his brother, speaks against the law and judges the law; but if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge of it.
James	Jas	59	4	12	There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the One who is able to save and to destroy; but who are you who judge your neighbor?
James	Jas	59	4	13	Come now, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a city, and spend a year there and engage in business and make a profit."
James	Jas	59	4	14	Yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow. You are just a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes away.
James	Jas	59	4	15	Instead, you ought to say, "If the Lord wills, we will live and also do this or that."
James	Jas	59	4	16	But as it is, you boast in your arrogance; all such boasting is evil.
James	Jas	59	4	17	Therefore, to one who knows the right thing to do and does not do it, to him it is sin.
James	Jas	59	5	1	Come now, you rich, weep and howl for your miseries which are coming upon you.
James	Jas	59	5	2	Your riches have rotted and your garments have become moth-eaten.
James	Jas	59	5	3	Your gold and your silver have rusted; and their rust will be a witness against you and will consume your flesh like fire. It is in the last days that you have stored up your treasure!
James	Jas	59	5	4	Behold, the pay of the laborers who mowed your fields, and which has been withheld by you, cries out against you; and the outcry of those who did the harvesting has reached the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.
James	Jas	59	5	5	You have lived luxuriously on the earth and led a life of wanton pleasure; you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter.
James	Jas	59	5	6	You have condemned and put to death the righteous man; he does not resist you.
James	Jas	59	5	7	Therefore be patient, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. The farmer waits for the precious produce of the soil, being patient about it, until it gets the early and late rains.
James	Jas	59	5	8	You too be patient; strengthen your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is near.
James	Jas	59	5	9	Do not complain, brethren, against one another, so that you yourselves may not be judged; behold, the Judge is standing right at the door.
James	Jas	59	5	10	As an example, brethren, of suffering and patience, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.
James	Jas	59	5	11	We count those blessed who endured. You have heard of the endurance of Job and have seen the outcome of the Lord's dealings, that the Lord is full of compassion and is merciful.
James	Jas	59	5	12	But above all, my brethren, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath; but your yes is to be yes, and your no, no, so that you may not fall under judgment.
James	Jas	59	5	13	Is anyone among you suffering? Then he must pray. Is anyone cheerful? He is to sing praises.
James	Jas	59	5	14	Is anyone among you sick? Then he must call for the elders of the church and they are to pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord;
James	Jas	59	5	15	and the prayer offered in faith will restore the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up, and if he has committed sins, they will be forgiven him.
James	Jas	59	5	16	Therefore, confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another so that you may be healed. The effective prayer of a righteous man can accomplish much.
James	Jas	59	5	17	Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months.
James	Jas	59	5	18	Then he prayed again, and the sky poured rain and the earth produced its fruit.
James	Jas	59	5	19	My brethren, if any among you strays from the truth and one turns him back,
James	Jas	59	5	20	let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.

Jude	Jude	65	1	1	Jude, a bond-servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, To those who are the called, beloved in God the Father, and kept for Jesus Christ:
Jude	Jude	65	1	2	May mercy and peace and love be multiplied to you.
Jude	Jude	65	1	3	Beloved, while I was making every effort to write you about our common salvation, I felt the necessity to write to you appealing that you contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all handed down to the saints.
Jude	Jude	65	1	4	For certain persons have crept in unnoticed, those who were long beforehand marked out for this condemnation, ungodly persons who turn the grace of our God into licentiousness and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.
Jude	Jude	65	1	5	Now I desire to remind you, though you know all things once for all, that the Lord, after saving a people out of the land of Egypt, subsequently destroyed those who did not believe.
Jude	Jude	65	1	6	And angels who did not keep their own domain, but abandoned their proper abode, He has kept in eternal bonds under darkness for the judgment of the great day,
Jude	Jude	65	1	7	just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, since they in the same way as these indulged in gross immorality and went after strange flesh, are exhibited as an example in undergoing the punishment of eternal fire.
Jude	Jude	65	1	8	Yet in the same way these men, also by dreaming, defile the flesh, and reject authority, and revile angelic majesties.
Jude	Jude	65	1	9	But Michael the archangel, when he disputed with the devil and argued about the body of Moses, did not dare pronounce against him a railing judgment, but said, "The Lord rebuke you!"
Jude	Jude	65	1	10	But these men revile the things which they do not understand; and the things which they know by instinct, like unreasoning animals, by these things they are destroyed.
Jude	Jude	65	1	11	Woe to them! For they have gone the way of Cain, and for pay they have rushed headlong into the error of Balaam, and perished in the rebellion of Korah.
Jude	Jude	65	1	12	These are the men who are hidden reefs in your love feasts when they feast with you without fear, caring for themselves; clouds without water, carried along by winds; autumn trees without fruit, doubly dead, uprooted;
Jude	Jude	65	1	13	wild waves of the sea, casting up their own shame like foam; wandering stars, for whom the black darkness has been reserved forever.
Jude	Jude	65	1	14	It was also about these men that Enoch, in the seventh generation from Adam, prophesied, saying, "Behold, the Lord came with many thousands of His holy ones,
Jude	Jude	65	1	15	to execute judgment upon all, and to convict all the ungodly of all their ungodly deeds which they have done in an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him."
Jude	Jude	65	1	16	These are grumblers, finding fault, following after their own lusts; they speak arrogantly, flattering people for the sake of gaining an advantage.
Jude	Jude	65	1	17	But you, beloved, ought to remember the words that were spoken beforehand by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ,
Jude	Jude	65	1	18	that they were saying to you, "In the last time there will be mockers, following after their own ungodly lusts."
Jude	Jude	65	1	19	These are the ones who cause divisions, worldly-minded, devoid of the Spirit.
Jude	Jude	65	1	20	But you, beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit,
Jude	Jude	65	1	21	keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting anxiously for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal life.
Jude	Jude	65	1	22	And have mercy on some, who are doubting;
Jude	Jude	65	1	23	save others, snatching them out of the fire; and on some have mercy with fear, hating even the garment polluted by the flesh.
Jude	Jude	65	1	24	Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling, and to make you stand in the presence of His glory blameless with great joy,
Jude	Jude	65	1	25	to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion and authority, before all time and now and forever. Amen.
Revelation	Rev	66	1	1	The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave Him to show to His bond-servants, the things which must soon take place; and He sent and communicated it by His angel to His bond-servant John,
Revelation	Rev	66	1	2	who testified to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, even to all that he saw.
Revelation	Rev	66	1	3	Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and heed the things which are written in it; for the time is near.
Revelation	Rev	66	1	4	John to the seven churches that are in Asia: Grace to you and peace, from Him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne,
Revelation	Rev	66	1	5	and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him who loves us and released us from our sins by His blood--
Revelation	Rev	66	1	6	and He has made us to be a kingdom, priests to His God and Father--to Him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.
Revelation	Rev	66	1	7	BEHOLD, HE IS COMING WITH THE CLOUDS, and every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the earth will mourn over Him. So it is to be. Amen.
Revelation	Rev	66	1	8	"I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, "who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty."
Revelation	Rev	66	1	9	I, John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and perseverance which are in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.
Revelation	Rev	66	1	10	I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like the sound of a trumpet,
Revelation	Rev	66	1	11	saying, "Write in a book what you see, and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea."
Revelation	Rev	66	1	12	Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking with me. And having turned I saw seven golden lampstands;
Revelation	Rev	66	1	13	and in the middle of the lampstands I saw one like a son of man, clothed in a robe reaching to the feet, and girded across His chest with a golden sash.
Revelation	Rev	66	1	14	His head and His hair were white like white wool, like snow; and His eyes were like a flame of fire.
Revelation	Rev	66	1	15	His feet were like burnished bronze, when it has been made to glow in a furnace, and His voice was like the sound of many waters.
Revelation	Rev	66	1	16	In His right hand He held seven stars, and out of His mouth came a sharp two-edged sword; and His face was like the sun shining in its strength.
Revelation	Rev	66	1	17	When I saw Him, I fell at His feet like a dead man. And He placed His right hand on me, saying, "Do not be afraid; I am the first and the last,
Revelation	Rev	66	1	18	and the living One; and I was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of death and of Hades.
Revelation	Rev	66	1	19	"Therefore write the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will take place after these things.
Revelation	Rev	66	1	20	"As for the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in My right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.
Revelation	Rev	66	2	1	"To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: The One who holds the seven stars in His right hand, the One who walks among the seven golden lampstands, says this:
Revelation	Rev	66	2	2	'I know your deeds and your toil and perseverance, and that you cannot tolerate evil men, and you put to the test those who call themselves apostles, and they are not, and you found them to be false;
Revelation	Rev	66	2	3	and you have perseverance and have endured for My name's sake, and have not grown weary.
Revelation	Rev	66	2	4	'But I have this against you, that you have left your first love.
Revelation	Rev	66	2	5	'Therefore remember from where you have fallen, and repent and do the deeds you did at first; or else I am coming to you and will remove your lampstand out of its place--unless you repent.
Revelation	Rev	66	2	6	'Yet this you do have, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
Revelation	Rev	66	2	7	'He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, I will grant to eat of the tree of life which is in the Paradise of God.'
Revelation	Rev	66	2	8	"And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write: The first and the last, who was dead, and has come to life, says this:
Revelation	Rev	66	2	9	'I know your tribulation and your poverty (but you are rich), and the blasphemy by those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.
Revelation	Rev	66	2	10	'Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison, so that you will be tested, and you will have tribulation for ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life.
Revelation	Rev	66	2	11	'He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes will not be hurt by the second death.'
Revelation	Rev	66	2	12	"And to the angel of the church in Pergamum write: The One who has the sharp two-edged sword says this:
Revelation	Rev	66	2	13	'I know where you dwell, where Satan's throne is; and you hold fast My name, and did not deny My faith even in the days of Antipas, My witness, My faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells.
Revelation	Rev	66	2	14	'But I have a few things against you, because you have there some who hold the teaching of Balaam, who kept teaching Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols and to commit acts of immorality.
Revelation	Rev	66	2	15	'So you also have some who in the same way hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans.
Revelation	Rev	66	2	16	'Therefore repent; or else I am coming to you quickly, and I will make war against them with the sword of My mouth.
Revelation	Rev	66	2	17	'He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, to him I will give some of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and a new name written on the stone which no one knows but he who receives it.'
Revelation	Rev	66	2	18	"And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write: The Son of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire, and His feet are like burnished bronze, says this:
Revelation	Rev	66	2	19	'I know your deeds, and your love and faith and service and perseverance, and that your deeds of late are greater than at first.
Revelation	Rev	66	2	20	'But I have this against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, and she teaches and leads My bond-servants astray so that they commit acts of immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols.
Revelation	Rev	66	2	21	'I gave her time to repent, and she does not want to repent of her immorality.
Revelation	Rev	66	2	22	'Behold, I will throw her on a bed of sickness, and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they repent of her deeds.
Revelation	Rev	66	2	23	'And I will kill her children with pestilence, and all the churches will know that I am He who searches the minds and hearts; and I will give to each one of you according to your deeds.
Revelation	Rev	66	2	24	'But I say to you, the rest who are in Thyatira, who do not hold this teaching, who have not known the deep things of Satan, as they call them--I place no other burden on you.
Revelation	Rev	66	2	25	'Nevertheless what you have, hold fast until I come.
Revelation	Rev	66	2	26	'He who overcomes, and he who keeps My deeds until the end, TO HIM I WILL GIVE AUTHORITY OVER THE NATIONS;
Revelation	Rev	66	2	27	AND HE SHALL RULE THEM WITH A ROD OF IRON, AS THE VESSELS OF THE POTTER ARE BROKEN TO PIECES, as I also have received authority from My Father;
Revelation	Rev	66	2	28	and I will give him the morning star.
Revelation	Rev	66	2	29	'He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.'
Revelation	Rev	66	3	1	"To the angel of the church in Sardis write: He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars, says this: 'I know your deeds, that you have a name that you are alive, but you are dead.
Revelation	Rev	66	3	2	'Wake up, and strengthen the things that remain, which were about to die; for I have not found your deeds completed in the sight of My God.
Revelation	Rev	66	3	3	'So remember what you have received and heard; and keep it, and repent. Therefore if you do not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come to you.
Revelation	Rev	66	3	4	'But you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their garments; and they will walk with Me in white, for they are worthy.
Revelation	Rev	66	3	5	'He who overcomes will thus be clothed in white garments; and I will not erase his name from the book of life, and I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels.
Revelation	Rev	66	3	6	'He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.'
Revelation	Rev	66	3	7	"And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: He who is holy, who is true, who has the key of David, who opens and no one will shut, and who shuts and no one opens, says this:
Revelation	Rev	66	3	8	'I know your deeds. Behold, I have put before you an open door which no one can shut, because you have a little power, and have kept My word, and have not denied My name.
Revelation	Rev	66	3	9	'Behold, I will cause those of the synagogue of Satan, who say that they are Jews and are not, but lie--I will make them come and bow down at your feet, and make them know that I have loved you.
Revelation	Rev	66	3	10	'Because you have kept the word of My perseverance, I also will keep you from the hour of testing, that hour which is about to come upon the whole world, to test those who dwell on the earth.
Revelation	Rev	66	3	11	'I am coming quickly; hold fast what you have, so that no one will take your crown.
Revelation	Rev	66	3	12	'He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he will not go out from it anymore; and I will write on him the name of My God, and the name of the city of My God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from My God, and My new name.
Revelation	Rev	66	3	13	'He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.'
Revelation	Rev	66	3	14	"To the angel of the church in Laodicea write: The Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the Beginning of the creation of God, says this:
Revelation	Rev	66	3	15	'I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot; I wish that you were cold or hot.
Revelation	Rev	66	3	16	'So because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of My mouth.
Revelation	Rev	66	3	17	'Because you say, "I am rich, and have become wealthy, and have need of nothing," and you do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked,
Revelation	Rev	66	3	18	I advise you to buy from Me gold refined by fire so that you may become rich, and white garments so that you may clothe yourself, and that the shame of your nakedness will not be revealed; and eye salve to anoint your eyes so that you may see.
Revelation	Rev	66	3	19	'Those whom I love, I reprove and discipline; therefore be zealous and repent.
Revelation	Rev	66	3	20	'Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and will dine with him, and he with Me.
Revelation	Rev	66	3	21	'He who overcomes, I will grant to him to sit down with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat down with My Father on His throne.
Revelation	Rev	66	3	22	'He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.'"
Revelation	Rev	66	4	1	After these things I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven, and the first voice which I had heard, like the sound of a trumpet speaking with me, said, "Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after these things."
Revelation	Rev	66	4	2	Immediately I was in the Spirit; and behold, a throne was standing in heaven, and One sitting on the throne.
Revelation	Rev	66	4	3	And He who was sitting was like a jasper stone and a sardius in appearance; and there was a rainbow around the throne, like an emerald in appearance.
Revelation	Rev	66	4	4	Around the throne were twenty-four thrones; and upon the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white garments, and golden crowns on their heads.
Revelation	Rev	66	4	5	Out from the throne come flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder. And there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God;
Revelation	Rev	66	4	6	and before the throne there was something like a sea of glass, like crystal; and in the center and around the throne, four living creatures full of eyes in front and behind.
Revelation	Rev	66	4	7	The first creature was like a lion, and the second creature like a calf, and the third creature had a face like that of a man, and the fourth creature was like a flying eagle.
Revelation	Rev	66	4	8	And the four living creatures, each one of them having six wings, are full of eyes around and within; and day and night they do not cease to say, "HOLY, HOLY, HOLY is THE LORD GOD, THE ALMIGHTY, WHO WAS AND WHO IS AND WHO IS TO COME."
Revelation	Rev	66	4	9	And when the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits on the throne, to Him who lives forever and ever,
Revelation	Rev	66	4	10	the twenty-four elders will fall down before Him who sits on the throne, and will worship Him who lives forever and ever, and will cast their crowns before the throne, saying,
Revelation	Rev	66	4	11	"Worthy are You, our Lord and our God, to receive glory and honor and power; for You created all things, and because of Your will they existed, and were created."
Revelation	Rev	66	5	1	I saw in the right hand of Him who sat on the throne a book written inside and on the back, sealed up with seven seals.
Revelation	Rev	66	5	2	And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the book and to break its seals?"
Revelation	Rev	66	5	3	And no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the book or to look into it.
Revelation	Rev	66	5	4	Then I began to weep greatly because no one was found worthy to open the book or to look into it;
Revelation	Rev	66	5	5	and one of the elders *said to me, "Stop weeping; behold, the Lion that is from the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome so as to open the book and its seven seals."
Revelation	Rev	66	5	6	And I saw between the throne (with the four living creatures) and the elders a Lamb standing, as if slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent out into all the earth.
Revelation	Rev	66	5	7	And He came and took the book out of the right hand of Him who sat on the throne.
Revelation	Rev	66	5	8	When He had taken the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each one holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.
Revelation	Rev	66	5	9	And they *sang a new song, saying, "Worthy are You to take the book and to break its seals; for You were slain, and purchased for God with Your blood men from every tribe and tongue and people and nation.
Revelation	Rev	66	5	10	"You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to our God; and they will reign upon the earth."
Revelation	Rev	66	5	11	Then I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and the number of them was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands,
Revelation	Rev	66	5	12	saying with a loud voice, "Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing."
Revelation	Rev	66	5	13	And every created thing which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all things in them, I heard saying, "To Him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb, be blessing and honor and glory and dominion forever and ever."
Revelation	Rev	66	5	14	And the four living creatures kept saying, "Amen." And the elders fell down and worshiped.
Revelation	Rev	66	6	1	Then I saw when the Lamb broke one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying as with a voice of thunder, "Come."
Revelation	Rev	66	6	2	I looked, and behold, a white horse, and he who sat on it had a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering and to conquer.
Revelation	Rev	66	6	3	When He broke the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, "Come."
Revelation	Rev	66	6	4	And another, a red horse, went out; and to him who sat on it, it was granted to take peace from the earth, and that men would slay one another; and a great sword was given to him.
Revelation	Rev	66	6	5	When He broke the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, "Come." I looked, and behold, a black horse; and he who sat on it had a pair of scales in his hand.
Revelation	Rev	66	6	6	And I heard something like a voice in the center of the four living creatures saying, "A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; and do not damage the oil and the wine."
Revelation	Rev	66	6	7	When the Lamb broke the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, "Come."
Revelation	Rev	66	6	8	I looked, and behold, an ashen horse; and he who sat on it had the name Death; and Hades was following with him. Authority was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword and with famine and with pestilence and by the wild beasts of the earth.
Revelation	Rev	66	6	9	When the Lamb broke the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God, and because of the testimony which they had maintained;
Revelation	Rev	66	6	10	and they cried out with a loud voice, saying, "How long, O Lord, holy and true, will You refrain from judging and avenging our blood on those who dwell on the earth?"
Revelation	Rev	66	6	11	And there was given to each of them a white robe; and they were told that they should rest for a little while longer, until the number of their fellow servants and their brethren who were to be killed even as they had been, would be completed also.
Revelation	Rev	66	6	12	I looked when He broke the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth made of hair, and the whole moon became like blood;
Revelation	Rev	66	6	13	and the stars of the sky fell to the earth, as a fig tree casts its unripe figs when shaken by a great wind.
Revelation	Rev	66	6	14	The sky was split apart like a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.
Revelation	Rev	66	6	15	Then the kings of the earth and the great men and the commanders and the rich and the strong and every slave and free man hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains;
Revelation	Rev	66	6	16	and they *said to the mountains and to the rocks, "Fall on us and hide us from the presence of Him who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb;
Revelation	Rev	66	6	17	for the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to stand?"
Revelation	Rev	66	7	1	After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth, so that no wind would blow on the earth or on the sea or on any tree.
Revelation	Rev	66	7	2	And I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God; and he cried out with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea,
Revelation	Rev	66	7	3	saying, "Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees until we have sealed the bond-servants of our God on their foreheads."
Revelation	Rev	66	7	4	And I heard the number of those who were sealed, one hundred and forty-four thousand sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel:
Revelation	Rev	66	7	5	from the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand were sealed, from the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand, from the tribe of Gad twelve thousand,
Revelation	Rev	66	7	6	from the tribe of Asher twelve thousand, from the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand, from the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand,
Revelation	Rev	66	7	7	from the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand, from the tribe of Levi twelve thousand, from the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand,
Revelation	Rev	66	7	8	from the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand, from the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand, from the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand were sealed.
Revelation	Rev	66	7	9	After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude which no one could count, from every nation and all tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, and palm branches were in their hands;
Revelation	Rev	66	7	10	and they cry out with a loud voice, saying, "Salvation to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb."
Revelation	Rev	66	7	11	And all the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures; and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God,
Revelation	Rev	66	7	12	saying, "Amen, blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might, be to our God forever and ever. Amen."
Revelation	Rev	66	7	13	Then one of the elders answered, saying to me, "These who are clothed in the white robes, who are they, and where have they come from?"
Revelation	Rev	66	7	14	I said to him, "My lord, you know." And he said to me, "These are the ones who come out of the great tribulation, and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
Revelation	Rev	66	7	15	"For this reason, they are before the throne of God; and they serve Him day and night in His temple; and He who sits on the throne will spread His tabernacle over them.
Revelation	Rev	66	7	16	"They will hunger no longer, nor thirst anymore; nor will the sun beat down on them, nor any heat;
Revelation	Rev	66	7	17	for the Lamb in the center of the throne will be their shepherd, and will guide them to springs of the water of life; and God will wipe every tear from their eyes."
Revelation	Rev	66	8	1	When the Lamb broke the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.
Revelation	Rev	66	8	2	And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.
Revelation	Rev	66	8	3	Another angel came and stood at the altar, holding a golden censer; and much incense was given to him, so that he might add it to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne.
Revelation	Rev	66	8	4	And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel's hand.
Revelation	Rev	66	8	5	Then the angel took the censer and filled it with the fire of the altar, and threw it to the earth; and there followed peals of thunder and sounds and flashes of lightning and an earthquake.
Revelation	Rev	66	8	6	And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound them.
Revelation	Rev	66	8	7	The first sounded, and there came hail and fire, mixed with blood, and they were thrown to the earth; and a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.
Revelation	Rev	66	8	8	The second angel sounded, and something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea; and a third of the sea became blood,
Revelation	Rev	66	8	9	and a third of the creatures which were in the sea and had life, died; and a third of the ships were destroyed.
Revelation	Rev	66	8	10	The third angel sounded, and a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of waters.
Revelation	Rev	66	8	11	The name of the star is called Wormwood; and a third of the waters became wormwood, and many men died from the waters, because they were made bitter.
Revelation	Rev	66	8	12	The fourth angel sounded, and a third of the sun and a third of the moon and a third of the stars were struck, so that a third of them would be darkened and the day would not shine for a third of it, and the night in the same way.
Revelation	Rev	66	8	13	Then I looked, and I heard an eagle flying in midheaven, saying with a loud voice, "Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound!"
Revelation	Rev	66	9	1	Then the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from heaven which had fallen to the earth; and the key of the bottomless pit was given to him.
Revelation	Rev	66	9	2	He opened the bottomless pit, and smoke went up out of the pit, like the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke of the pit.
Revelation	Rev	66	9	3	Then out of the smoke came locusts upon the earth, and power was given them, as the scorpions of the earth have power.
Revelation	Rev	66	9	4	They were told not to hurt the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but only the men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.
Revelation	Rev	66	9	5	And they were not permitted to kill anyone, but to torment for five months; and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it stings a man.
Revelation	Rev	66	9	6	And in those days men will seek death and will not find it; they will long to die, and death flees from them.
Revelation	Rev	66	9	7	The appearance of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle; and on their heads appeared to be crowns like gold, and their faces were like the faces of men.
Revelation	Rev	66	9	8	They had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were like the teeth of lions.
Revelation	Rev	66	9	9	They had breastplates like breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots, of many horses rushing to battle.
Revelation	Rev	66	9	10	They have tails like scorpions, and stings; and in their tails is their power to hurt men for five months.
Revelation	Rev	66	9	11	They have as king over them, the angel of the abyss; his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in the Greek he has the name Apollyon.
Revelation	Rev	66	9	12	The first woe is past; behold, two woes are still coming after these things.
Revelation	Rev	66	9	13	Then the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,
Revelation	Rev	66	9	14	one saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, "Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates."
Revelation	Rev	66	9	15	And the four angels, who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, were released, so that they would kill a third of mankind.
Revelation	Rev	66	9	16	The number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred million; I heard the number of them.
Revelation	Rev	66	9	17	And this is how I saw in the vision the horses and those who sat on them: the riders had breastplates the color of fire and of hyacinth and of brimstone; and the heads of the horses are like the heads of lions; and out of their mouths proceed fire and smoke and brimstone.
Revelation	Rev	66	9	18	A third of mankind was killed by these three plagues, by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone which proceeded out of their mouths.
Revelation	Rev	66	9	19	For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents and have heads, and with them they do harm.
Revelation	Rev	66	9	20	The rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands, so as not to worship demons, and the idols of gold and of silver and of brass and of stone and of wood, which can neither see nor hear nor walk;
Revelation	Rev	66	9	21	and they did not repent of their murders nor of their sorceries nor of their immorality nor of their thefts.
Revelation	Rev	66	10	1	I saw another strong angel coming down out of heaven, clothed with a cloud; and the rainbow was upon his head, and his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire;
Revelation	Rev	66	10	2	and he had in his hand a little book which was open. He placed his right foot on the sea and his left on the land;
Revelation	Rev	66	10	3	and he cried out with a loud voice, as when a lion roars; and when he had cried out, the seven peals of thunder uttered their voices.
Revelation	Rev	66	10	4	When the seven peals of thunder had spoken, I was about to write; and I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Seal up the things which the seven peals of thunder have spoken and do not write them."
Revelation	Rev	66	10	5	Then the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up his right hand to heaven,
Revelation	Rev	66	10	6	and swore by Him who lives forever and ever, WHO CREATED HEAVEN AND THE THINGS IN IT, AND THE EARTH AND THE THINGS IN IT, AND THE SEA AND THE THINGS IN IT, that there will be delay no longer,
Revelation	Rev	66	10	7	but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, then the mystery of God is finished, as He preached to His servants the prophets.
Revelation	Rev	66	10	8	Then the voice which I heard from heaven, I heard again speaking with me, and saying, "Go, take the book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land."
Revelation	Rev	66	10	9	So I went to the angel, telling him to give me the little book. And he *said to me, "Take it and eat it; it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey."
Revelation	Rev	66	10	10	I took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it, and in my mouth it was sweet as honey; and when I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter.
Revelation	Rev	66	10	11	And they *said to me, "You must prophesy again concerning many peoples and nations and tongues and kings."
Revelation	Rev	66	11	1	Then there was given me a measuring rod like a staff; and someone said, "Get up and measure the temple of God and the altar, and those who worship in it.
Revelation	Rev	66	11	2	"Leave out the court which is outside the temple and do not measure it, for it has been given to the nations; and they will tread under foot the holy city for forty-two months.
Revelation	Rev	66	11	3	"And I will grant authority to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for twelve hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth."
Revelation	Rev	66	11	4	These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth.
Revelation	Rev	66	11	5	And if anyone wants to harm them, fire flows out of their mouth and devours their enemies; so if anyone wants to harm them, he must be killed in this way.
Revelation	Rev	66	11	6	These have the power to shut up the sky, so that rain will not fall during the days of their prophesying; and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as they desire.
Revelation	Rev	66	11	7	When they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war with them, and overcome them and kill them.
Revelation	Rev	66	11	8	And their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city which mystically is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.
Revelation	Rev	66	11	9	Those from the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days, and will not permit their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb.
Revelation	Rev	66	11	10	And those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them and celebrate; and they will send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth.
Revelation	Rev	66	11	11	But after the three and a half days, the breath of life from God came into them, and they stood on their feet; and great fear fell upon those who were watching them.
Revelation	Rev	66	11	12	And they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, "Come up here." Then they went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies watched them.
Revelation	Rev	66	11	13	And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell; seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.
Revelation	Rev	66	11	14	The second woe is past; behold, the third woe is coming quickly.
Revelation	Rev	66	11	15	Then the seventh angel sounded; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ; and He will reign forever and ever."
Revelation	Rev	66	11	16	And the twenty-four elders, who sit on their thrones before God, fell on their faces and worshiped God,
Revelation	Rev	66	11	17	saying, "We give You thanks, O Lord God, the Almighty, who are and who were, because You have taken Your great power and have begun to reign.
Revelation	Rev	66	11	18	"And the nations were enraged, and Your wrath came, and the time came for the dead to be judged, and the time to reward Your bond-servants the prophets and the saints and those who fear Your name, the small and the great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth."
Revelation	Rev	66	11	19	And the temple of God which is in heaven was opened; and the ark of His covenant appeared in His temple, and there were flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder and an earthquake and a great hailstorm.
Revelation	Rev	66	12	1	A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars;
Revelation	Rev	66	12	2	and she was with child; and she *cried out, being in labor and in pain to give birth.
Revelation	Rev	66	12	3	Then another sign appeared in heaven: and behold, a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads were seven diadems.
Revelation	Rev	66	12	4	And his tail *swept away a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she gave birth he might devour her child.
Revelation	Rev	66	12	5	And she gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron; and her child was caught up to God and to His throne.
Revelation	Rev	66	12	6	Then the woman fled into the wilderness where she *had a place prepared by God, so that there she would be nourished for one thousand two hundred and sixty days.
Revelation	Rev	66	12	7	And there was war in heaven, Michael and his angels waging war with the dragon. The dragon and his angels waged war,
Revelation	Rev	66	12	8	and they were not strong enough, and there was no longer a place found for them in heaven.
Revelation	Rev	66	12	9	And the great dragon was thrown down, the serpent of old who is called the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.
Revelation	Rev	66	12	10	Then I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, "Now the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren has been thrown down, he who accuses them before our God day and night.
Revelation	Rev	66	12	11	"And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they did not love their life even when faced with death.
Revelation	Rev	66	12	12	"For this reason, rejoice, O heavens and you who dwell in them. Woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has only a short time."
Revelation	Rev	66	12	13	And when the dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child.
Revelation	Rev	66	12	14	But the two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman, so that she could fly into the wilderness to her place, where she *was nourished for a time and times and half a time, from the presence of the serpent.
Revelation	Rev	66	12	15	And the serpent poured water like a river out of his mouth after the woman, so that he might cause her to be swept away with the flood.
Revelation	Rev	66	12	16	But the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and drank up the river which the dragon poured out of his mouth.
Revelation	Rev	66	12	17	So the dragon was enraged with the woman, and went off to make war with the rest of her children, who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus.
Revelation	Rev	66	13	1	And the dragon stood on the sand of the seashore. Then I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and on his horns were ten diadems, and on his heads were blasphemous names.
Revelation	Rev	66	13	2	And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority.
Revelation	Rev	66	13	3	I saw one of his heads as if it had been slain, and his fatal wound was healed. And the whole earth was amazed and followed after the beast;
Revelation	Rev	66	13	4	they worshiped the dragon because he gave his authority to the beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying, "Who is like the beast, and who is able to wage war with him?"
Revelation	Rev	66	13	5	There was given to him a mouth speaking arrogant words and blasphemies, and authority to act for forty-two months was given to him.
Revelation	Rev	66	13	6	And he opened his mouth in blasphemies against God, to blaspheme His name and His tabernacle, that is, those who dwell in heaven.
Revelation	Rev	66	13	7	It was also given to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them, and authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation was given to him.
Revelation	Rev	66	13	8	All who dwell on the earth will worship him, everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who has been slain.
Revelation	Rev	66	13	9	If anyone has an ear, let him hear.
Revelation	Rev	66	13	10	If anyone is destined for captivity, to captivity he goes; if anyone kills with the sword, with the sword he must be killed. Here is the perseverance and the faith of the saints.
Revelation	Rev	66	13	11	Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb and he spoke as a dragon.
Revelation	Rev	66	13	12	He exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence. And he makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed.
Revelation	Rev	66	13	13	He performs great signs, so that he even makes fire come down out of heaven to the earth in the presence of men.
Revelation	Rev	66	13	14	And he deceives those who dwell on the earth because of the signs which it was given him to perform in the presence of the beast, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who *had the wound of the sword and has come to life.
Revelation	Rev	66	13	15	And it was given to him to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast would even speak and cause as many as do not worship the image of the beast to be killed.
Revelation	Rev	66	13	16	And he causes all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free men and the slaves, to be given a mark on their right hand or on their forehead,
Revelation	Rev	66	13	17	and he provides that no one will be able to buy or to sell, except the one who has the mark, either the name of the beast or the number of his name.
Revelation	Rev	66	13	18	Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for the number is that of a man; and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.
Revelation	Rev	66	14	1	Then I looked, and behold, the Lamb was standing on Mount Zion, and with Him one hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads.
Revelation	Rev	66	14	2	And I heard a voice from heaven, like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder, and the voice which I heard was like the sound of harpists playing on their harps.
Revelation	Rev	66	14	3	And they *sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders; and no one could learn the song except the one hundred and forty-four thousand who had been purchased from the earth.
Revelation	Rev	66	14	4	These are the ones who have not been defiled with women, for they have kept themselves chaste. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These have been purchased from among men as first fruits to God and to the Lamb.
Revelation	Rev	66	14	5	And no lie was found in their mouth; they are blameless.
Revelation	Rev	66	14	6	And I saw another angel flying in midheaven, having an eternal gospel to preach to those who live on the earth, and to every nation and tribe and tongue and people;
Revelation	Rev	66	14	7	and he said with a loud voice, "Fear God, and give Him glory, because the hour of His judgment has come; worship Him who made the heaven and the earth and sea and springs of waters."
Revelation	Rev	66	14	8	And another angel, a second one, followed, saying, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, she who has made all the nations drink of the wine of the passion of her immorality."
Revelation	Rev	66	14	9	Then another angel, a third one, followed them, saying with a loud voice, "If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,
Revelation	Rev	66	14	10	he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is mixed in full strength in the cup of His anger; and he will be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.
Revelation	Rev	66	14	11	"And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever; they have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name."
Revelation	Rev	66	14	12	Here is the perseverance of the saints who keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus.
Revelation	Rev	66	14	13	And I heard a voice from heaven, saying, "Write, 'Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on!'" "Yes," says the Spirit, "so that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow with them."
Revelation	Rev	66	14	14	Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and sitting on the cloud was one like a son of man, having a golden crown on His head and a sharp sickle in His hand.
Revelation	Rev	66	14	15	And another angel came out of the temple, crying out with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, "Put in your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come, because the harvest of the earth is ripe."
Revelation	Rev	66	14	16	Then He who sat on the cloud swung His sickle over the earth, and the earth was reaped.
Revelation	Rev	66	14	17	And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, and he also had a sharp sickle.
Revelation	Rev	66	14	18	Then another angel, the one who has power over fire, came out from the altar; and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, "Put in your sharp sickle and gather the clusters from the vine of the earth, because her grapes are ripe."
Revelation	Rev	66	14	19	So the angel swung his sickle to the earth and gathered the clusters from the vine of the earth, and threw them into the great wine press of the wrath of God.
Revelation	Rev	66	14	20	And the wine press was trodden outside the city, and blood came out from the wine press, up to the horses' bridles, for a distance of two hundred miles.
Revelation	Rev	66	15	1	Then I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels who had seven plagues, which are the last, because in them the wrath of God is finished.
Revelation	Rev	66	15	2	And I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those who had been victorious over the beast and his image and the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, holding harps of God.
Revelation	Rev	66	15	3	And they *sang the song of Moses, the bond-servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, "Great and marvelous are Your works, O Lord God, the Almighty; Righteous and true are Your ways, King of the nations!
Revelation	Rev	66	15	4	"Who will not fear, O Lord, and glorify Your name? For You alone are holy; For ALL THE NATIONS WILL COME AND WORSHIP BEFORE YOU, FOR YOUR RIGHTEOUS ACTS HAVE BEEN REVEALED."
Revelation	Rev	66	15	5	After these things I looked, and the temple of the tabernacle of testimony in heaven was opened,
Revelation	Rev	66	15	6	and the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of the temple, clothed in linen, clean and bright, and girded around their chests with golden sashes.
Revelation	Rev	66	15	7	Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever.
Revelation	Rev	66	15	8	And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His power; and no one was able to enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished.
Revelation	Rev	66	16	1	Then I heard a loud voice from the temple, saying to the seven angels, "Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of God."
Revelation	Rev	66	16	2	So the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth; and it became a loathsome and malignant sore on the people who had the mark of the beast and who worshiped his image.
Revelation	Rev	66	16	3	The second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became blood like that of a dead man; and every living thing in the sea died.
Revelation	Rev	66	16	4	Then the third angel poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of waters; and they became blood.
Revelation	Rev	66	16	5	And I heard the angel of the waters saying, "Righteous are You, who are and who were, O Holy One, because You judged these things;
Revelation	Rev	66	16	6	for they poured out the blood of saints and prophets, and You have given them blood to drink. They deserve it."
Revelation	Rev	66	16	7	And I heard the altar saying, "Yes, O Lord God, the Almighty, true and righteous are Your judgments."
Revelation	Rev	66	16	8	The fourth angel poured out his bowl upon the sun, and it was given to it to scorch men with fire.
Revelation	Rev	66	16	9	Men were scorched with fierce heat; and they blasphemed the name of God who has the power over these plagues, and they did not repent so as to give Him glory.
Revelation	Rev	66	16	10	Then the fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom became darkened; and they gnawed their tongues because of pain,
Revelation	Rev	66	16	11	and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores; and they did not repent of their deeds.
Revelation	Rev	66	16	12	The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river, the Euphrates; and its water was dried up, so that the way would be prepared for the kings from the east.
Revelation	Rev	66	16	13	And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs;
Revelation	Rev	66	16	14	for they are spirits of demons, performing signs, which go out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them together for the war of the great day of God, the Almighty.
Revelation	Rev	66	16	15	("Behold, I am coming like a thief. Blessed is the one who stays awake and keeps his clothes, so that he will not walk about naked and men will not see his shame.")
Revelation	Rev	66	16	16	And they gathered them together to the place which in Hebrew is called Har-Magedon.
Revelation	Rev	66	16	17	Then the seventh angel poured out his bowl upon the air, and a loud voice came out of the temple from the throne, saying, "It is done."
Revelation	Rev	66	16	18	And there were flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder; and there was a great earthquake, such as there had not been since man came to be upon the earth, so great an earthquake was it, and so mighty.
Revelation	Rev	66	16	19	The great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. Babylon the great was remembered before God, to give her the cup of the wine of His fierce wrath.
Revelation	Rev	66	16	20	And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.
Revelation	Rev	66	16	21	And huge hailstones, about one hundred pounds each, *came down from heaven upon men; and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail, because its plague *was extremely severe.
Revelation	Rev	66	17	1	Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, "Come here, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters,
Revelation	Rev	66	17	2	with whom the kings of the earth committed acts of immorality, and those who dwell on the earth were made drunk with the wine of her immorality."
Revelation	Rev	66	17	3	And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness; and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast, full of blasphemous names, having seven heads and ten horns.
Revelation	Rev	66	17	4	The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a gold cup full of abominations and of the unclean things of her immorality,
Revelation	Rev	66	17	5	and on her forehead a name was written, a mystery, "BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH."
Revelation	Rev	66	17	6	And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. When I saw her, I wondered greatly.
Revelation	Rev	66	17	7	And the angel said to me, "Why do you wonder? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns.
Revelation	Rev	66	17	8	"The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to come up out of the abyss and go to destruction. And those who dwell on the earth, whose name has not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, will wonder when they see the beast, that he was and is not and will come.
Revelation	Rev	66	17	9	"Here is the mind which has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits,
Revelation	Rev	66	17	10	and they are seven kings; five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he comes, he must remain a little while.
Revelation	Rev	66	17	11	"The beast which was and is not, is himself also an eighth and is one of the seven, and he goes to destruction.
Revelation	Rev	66	17	12	"The ten horns which you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but they receive authority as kings with the beast for one hour.
Revelation	Rev	66	17	13	"These have one purpose, and they give their power and authority to the beast.
Revelation	Rev	66	17	14	"These will wage war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, because He is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those who are with Him are the called and chosen and faithful."
Revelation	Rev	66	17	15	And he *said to me, "The waters which you saw where the harlot sits, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues.
Revelation	Rev	66	17	16	"And the ten horns which you saw, and the beast, these will hate the harlot and will make her desolate and naked, and will eat her flesh and will burn her up with fire.
Revelation	Rev	66	17	17	"For God has put it in their hearts to execute His purpose by having a common purpose, and by giving their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God will be fulfilled.
Revelation	Rev	66	17	18	"The woman whom you saw is the great city, which reigns over the kings of the earth."
Revelation	Rev	66	18	1	After these things I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority, and the earth was illumined with his glory.
Revelation	Rev	66	18	2	And he cried out with a mighty voice, saying, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great! She has become a dwelling place of demons and a prison of every unclean spirit, and a prison of every unclean and hateful bird.
Revelation	Rev	66	18	3	"For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the passion of her immorality, and the kings of the earth have committed acts of immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth have become rich by the wealth of her sensuality."
Revelation	Rev	66	18	4	I heard another voice from heaven, saying, "Come out of her, my people, so that you will not participate in her sins and receive of her plagues;
Revelation	Rev	66	18	5	for her sins have piled up as high as heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.
Revelation	Rev	66	18	6	"Pay her back even as she has paid, and give back to her double according to her deeds; in the cup which she has mixed, mix twice as much for her.
Revelation	Rev	66	18	7	"To the degree that she glorified herself and lived sensuously, to the same degree give her torment and mourning; for she says in her heart, 'I SIT as A QUEEN AND I AM NOT A WIDOW, and will never see mourning.'
Revelation	Rev	66	18	8	"For this reason in one day her plagues will come, pestilence and mourning and famine, and she will be burned up with fire; for the Lord God who judges her is strong.
Revelation	Rev	66	18	9	"And the kings of the earth, who committed acts of immorality and lived sensuously with her, will weep and lament over her when they see the smoke of her burning,
Revelation	Rev	66	18	10	standing at a distance because of the fear of her torment, saying, 'Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong city! For in one hour your judgment has come.'
Revelation	Rev	66	18	11	"And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, because no one buys their cargoes any more--
Revelation	Rev	66	18	12	cargoes of gold and silver and precious stones and pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet, and every kind of citron wood and every article of ivory and every article made from very costly wood and bronze and iron and marble,
Revelation	Rev	66	18	13	and cinnamon and spice and incense and perfume and frankincense and wine and olive oil and fine flour and wheat and cattle and sheep, and cargoes of horses and chariots and slaves and human lives.
Revelation	Rev	66	18	14	"The fruit you long for has gone from you, and all things that were luxurious and splendid have passed away from you and men will no longer find them.
Revelation	Rev	66	18	15	"The merchants of these things, who became rich from her, will stand at a distance because of the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning,
Revelation	Rev	66	18	16	saying, 'Woe, woe, the great city, she who was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls;
Revelation	Rev	66	18	17	for in one hour such great wealth has been laid waste!' And every shipmaster and every passenger and sailor, and as many as make their living by the sea, stood at a distance,
Revelation	Rev	66	18	18	and were crying out as they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, 'What city is like the great city?'
Revelation	Rev	66	18	19	"And they threw dust on their heads and were crying out, weeping and mourning, saying, 'Woe, woe, the great city, in which all who had ships at sea became rich by her wealth, for in one hour she has been laid waste!'
Revelation	Rev	66	18	20	"Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you saints and apostles and prophets, because God has pronounced judgment for you against her."
Revelation	Rev	66	18	21	Then a strong angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, "So will Babylon, the great city, be thrown down with violence, and will not be found any longer.
Revelation	Rev	66	18	22	"And the sound of harpists and musicians and flute-players and trumpeters will not be heard in you any longer; and no craftsman of any craft will be found in you any longer; and the sound of a mill will not be heard in you any longer;
Revelation	Rev	66	18	23	and the light of a lamp will not shine in you any longer; and the voice of the bridegroom and bride will not be heard in you any longer; for your merchants were the great men of the earth, because all the nations were deceived by your sorcery.
Revelation	Rev	66	18	24	"And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all who have been slain on the earth."
Revelation	Rev	66	19	1	After these things I heard something like a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, "Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God;
Revelation	Rev	66	19	2	BECAUSE HIS JUDGMENTS ARE TRUE AND RIGHTEOUS; for He has judged the great harlot who was corrupting the earth with her immorality, and HE HAS AVENGED THE BLOOD OF HIS BOND-SERVANTS ON HER."
Revelation	Rev	66	19	3	And a second time they said, "Hallelujah! HER SMOKE RISES UP FOREVER AND EVER."
Revelation	Rev	66	19	4	And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who sits on the throne saying, "Amen. Hallelujah!"
Revelation	Rev	66	19	5	And a voice came from the throne, saying, "Give praise to our God, all you His bond-servants, you who fear Him, the small and the great."
Revelation	Rev	66	19	6	Then I heard something like the voice of a great multitude and like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty peals of thunder, saying, "Hallelujah! For the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns.
Revelation	Rev	66	19	7	"Let us rejoice and be glad and give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come and His bride has made herself ready."
Revelation	Rev	66	19	8	It was given to her to clothe herself in fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.
Revelation	Rev	66	19	9	Then he *said to me, "Write, 'Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb.'" And he *said to me, "These are true words of God."
Revelation	Rev	66	19	10	Then I fell at his feet to worship him. But he *said to me, "Do not do that; I am a fellow servant of yours and your brethren who hold the testimony of Jesus; worship God. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."
Revelation	Rev	66	19	11	And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and He who sat on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and wages war.
Revelation	Rev	66	19	12	His eyes are a flame of fire, and on His head are many diadems; and He has a name written on Him which no one knows except Himself.
Revelation	Rev	66	19	13	He is clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God.
Revelation	Rev	66	19	14	And the armies which are in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, were following Him on white horses.
Revelation	Rev	66	19	15	From His mouth comes a sharp sword, so that with it He may strike down the nations, and He will rule them with a rod of iron; and He treads the wine press of the fierce wrath of God, the Almighty.
Revelation	Rev	66	19	16	And on His robe and on His thigh He has a name written, "KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS."
Revelation	Rev	66	19	17	Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with a loud voice, saying to all the birds which fly in midheaven, "Come, assemble for the great supper of God,
Revelation	Rev	66	19	18	so that you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of commanders and the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them and the flesh of all men, both free men and slaves, and small and great."
Revelation	Rev	66	19	19	And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies assembled to make war against Him who sat on the horse and against His army.
Revelation	Rev	66	19	20	And the beast was seized, and with him the false prophet who performed the signs in his presence, by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image; these two were thrown alive into the lake of fire which burns with brimstone.
Revelation	Rev	66	19	21	And the rest were killed with the sword which came from the mouth of Him who sat on the horse, and all the birds were filled with their flesh.
Revelation	Rev	66	20	1	Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand.
Revelation	Rev	66	20	2	And he laid hold of the dragon, the serpent of old, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years;
Revelation	Rev	66	20	3	and he threw him into the abyss, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he would not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were completed; after these things he must be released for a short time.
Revelation	Rev	66	20	4	Then I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received the mark on their forehead and on their hand; and they came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.
Revelation	Rev	66	20	5	The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were completed. This is the first resurrection.
Revelation	Rev	66	20	6	Blessed and holy is the one who has a part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years.
Revelation	Rev	66	20	7	When the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison,
Revelation	Rev	66	20	8	and will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war; the number of them is like the sand of the seashore.
Revelation	Rev	66	20	9	And they came up on the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, and fire came down from heaven and devoured them.
Revelation	Rev	66	20	10	And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.
Revelation	Rev	66	20	11	Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it, from whose presence earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them.
Revelation	Rev	66	20	12	And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the dead were judged from the things which were written in the books, according to their deeds.
Revelation	Rev	66	20	13	And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged, every one of them according to their deeds.
Revelation	Rev	66	20	14	Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.
Revelation	Rev	66	20	15	And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.
Revelation	Rev	66	21	1	Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and there is no longer any sea.
Revelation	Rev	66	21	2	And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, made ready as a bride adorned for her husband.
Revelation	Rev	66	21	3	And I heard a loud voice from the throne, saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is among men, and He will dwell among them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself will be among them,
Revelation	Rev	66	21	4	and He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there will no longer be any death; there will no longer be any mourning, or crying, or pain; the first things have passed away."
Revelation	Rev	66	21	5	And He who sits on the throne said, "Behold, I am making all things new." And He *said, "Write, for these words are faithful and true."
Revelation	Rev	66	21	6	Then He said to me, "It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to the one who thirsts from the spring of the water of life without cost.
Revelation	Rev	66	21	7	"He who overcomes will inherit these things, and I will be his God and he will be My son.
Revelation	Rev	66	21	8	"But for the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and immoral persons and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars, their part will be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death."
Revelation	Rev	66	21	9	Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and spoke with me, saying, "Come here, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb."
Revelation	Rev	66	21	10	And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,
Revelation	Rev	66	21	11	having the glory of God. Her brilliance was like a very costly stone, as a stone of crystal-clear jasper.
Revelation	Rev	66	21	12	It had a great and high wall, with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels; and names were written on them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.
Revelation	Rev	66	21	13	There were three gates on the east and three gates on the north and three gates on the south and three gates on the west.
Revelation	Rev	66	21	14	And the wall of the city had twelve foundation stones, and on them were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
Revelation	Rev	66	21	15	The one who spoke with me had a gold measuring rod to measure the city, and its gates and its wall.
Revelation	Rev	66	21	16	The city is laid out as a square, and its length is as great as the width; and he measured the city with the rod, fifteen hundred miles; its length and width and height are equal.
Revelation	Rev	66	21	17	And he measured its wall, seventy-two yards, according to human measurements, which are also angelic measurements.
Revelation	Rev	66	21	18	The material of the wall was jasper; and the city was pure gold, like clear glass.
Revelation	Rev	66	21	19	The foundation stones of the city wall were adorned with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation stone was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;
Revelation	Rev	66	21	20	the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.
Revelation	Rev	66	21	21	And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was a single pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.
Revelation	Rev	66	21	22	I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.
Revelation	Rev	66	21	23	And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God has illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb.
Revelation	Rev	66	21	24	The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.
Revelation	Rev	66	21	25	In the daytime (for there will be no night there) its gates will never be closed;
Revelation	Rev	66	21	26	and they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it;
Revelation	Rev	66	21	27	and nothing unclean, and no one who practices abomination and lying, shall ever come into it, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life.
Revelation	Rev	66	22	1	Then he showed me a river of the water of life, clear as crystal, coming from the throne of God and of the Lamb,
Revelation	Rev	66	22	2	in the middle of its street. On either side of the river was the tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit every month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.
Revelation	Rev	66	22	3	There will no longer be any curse; and the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and His bond-servants will serve Him;
Revelation	Rev	66	22	4	they will see His face, and His name will be on their foreheads.
Revelation	Rev	66	22	5	And there will no longer be any night; and they will not have need of the light of a lamp nor the light of the sun, because the Lord God will illumine them; and they will reign forever and ever.
Revelation	Rev	66	22	6	And he said to me, "These words are faithful and true"; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent His angel to show to His bond-servants the things which must soon take place.
Revelation	Rev	66	22	7	"And behold, I am coming quickly. Blessed is he who heeds the words of the prophecy of this book."
Revelation	Rev	66	22	8	I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed me these things.
Revelation	Rev	66	22	9	But he *said to me, "Do not do that. I am a fellow servant of yours and of your brethren the prophets and of those who heed the words of this book. Worship God."
Revelation	Rev	66	22	10	And he *said to me, "Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near.
Revelation	Rev	66	22	11	"Let the one who does wrong, still do wrong; and the one who is filthy, still be filthy; and let the one who is righteous, still practice righteousness; and the one who is holy, still keep himself holy."
Revelation	Rev	66	22	12	"Behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to render to every man according to what he has done.
Revelation	Rev	66	22	13	"I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end."
Revelation	Rev	66	22	14	Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter by the gates into the city.
Revelation	Rev	66	22	15	Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the immoral persons and the murderers and the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices lying.
Revelation	Rev	66	22	16	"I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify to you these things for the churches. I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star."
Revelation	Rev	66	22	17	The Spirit and the bride say, "Come." And let the one who hears say, "Come." And let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who wishes take the water of life without cost.
Revelation	Rev	66	22	18	I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues which are written in this book;
Revelation	Rev	66	22	19	and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the tree of life and from the holy city, which are written in this book.
Revelation	Rev	66	22	20	He who testifies to these things says, "Yes, I am coming quickly." Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.
Revelation	Rev	66	22	21	The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all. Amen.
