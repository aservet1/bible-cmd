GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	1	But of the Jews none washed his hands, neither Herod nor one of his judges. Andsince they did not desire to wash, Pilate stood up.
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	2	And then Herod the king orders the Lord to be taken away, having said to them,'What I ordered you to do, do.'
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	3	But Joseph, the friend of Pilate and of the Lord, had been standing there; andknowing they were about to crucify him, he came before Pilate and requested the bodyof the Lord for burial.
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	4	And Pilate, having sent to Herod, requested his body.
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	5	And Herod said: 'Brother Pilate, even if no one had requested him, we would haveburied him, since indeed Sabbath is dawning. For in the Law it has been written: Thesun is not to set on one put todeath.' And he gave him over to the people before thefirst day of their feast of the Unleavened Bread.
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	6	But having taken the Lord, running, they were pushing him and saying, 'Let us dragalong the Son of God now that we have power over him.'
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	7	And they clothed him with purple and sat him on a chair of judgment, saying: 'Judgejustly, King of Israel.'
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	8	And a certain one of them, having brought a thorny crown, put it on the head of theLord.
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	9	And others who were standing there were spitting in his face, and others slapped hischeeks. Others were jabbing him with a reed; and some scourged him, saying, 'Withsuch honor let us honor the Son of God.'
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	10	And they brought two wrongdoers and crucified the Lord in the middle of them. Buthe was silent as having no pain.
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	11	And when they had set the cross upright, they inscribed that THIS IS THE KING OFISRAEL.
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	12	And having put his garments before him, theydivided them up and threw as a gamble for them.
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	13	But a certain one of those wrongdoers reviled them, saying: 'We have been madesuffer thus because of the wrong that we have done; but this one, having becomeSavior of men, what injustice had he done to you?'
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	14	And having become irritated at him, they ordered that there be no leg-breaking, sothat he might die tormented.
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	15	But is was midday, and darkness held fast all Judea; and they were distressed andanxious lest the sun had set, since he was still living. For it is written for them: Let not the sun set on one put to death.
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	16	And someone of them said: 'Give him to drink gall with vinegary wine.' And havingmade a mixture, they gave to drink.
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	17	And they fulfilled all things and completed the sins on their own head.
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	18	But many went around with lamps, thinking that it was night, and they fell.
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	19	And the Lord screamed out, saying: 'My power, O power, you have forsaken me.'And having said this, he was taken up.
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	20	And at the same hour the veil of the Jerusalem sanctuary was torn into two.
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	21	And they drew out the nails from the hands of the Lord and placed him on the earth;and all the earth was shaken, and a great fear came about.
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	22	Then the sun shone, and it was found to be the ninth hour.
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	23	And the Jews rejoiced and gave his body to Joseph that he might bury it, since hewas one who had seen the many good things he did.
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	24	And having taken the Lord, he washed and tied him with a linen cloth and broughthim into his own sepulcher, called the Garden of Joseph.
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	25	Then the Jews and the elders and the priests, having come to know how muchwrong they had done themselves, began to beat themselves and say: 'Woe to our sins.The judgment has approached and the end of Jerusalem.'
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	26	But I with the companions was sorrowful; and having been wounded in spirit, wewere in hiding, for we were sought after by them as wrongdoers and as wishing to setfire to the sanctuary.
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	27	In addition to all these things we were fasting; and we were sitting mourning andweeping night and day until the Sabbath.
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	28	But the scribes and Pharisees and elders, having gathered together with oneanother, having heard that all the people were murmuring and beating their breasts,saying that 'If at his death these very great signs happened, behold how just he was,'
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	29	feared (especially the elders) and came before Pilate, begging him and saying, 
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	30	'Give over soldiers to us in order that we may safeguard his burial place for three days,lest, having come, his disciples steal him, and the people accept that he is risen fromthe death, and they do us wrong.'
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	31	But Pilate gave over to them Petronius the centurion with soldiers to safeguard thesepulcher. And with these the elders and scribes came to the burial place.
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	32	And having rolled a large stone, all who were there, together with the centurion andthe soldiers, placed it against the door of the burial place.
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	33	And they marked it with seven wax seals; and having pitched a tent there, theysafeguarded it.
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	34	But early when the Sabbath was dawning, a crowd came from Jerusalem and thesurrounding area in order that they might see the sealed tomb.
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	35	But in the night in which the Lord's day dawned, when the soldiers weresafeguarding it two by two in every watch, there was a loud voice in heaven;
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	36	and they saw that the heavens were opened and that two males who had muchradiance had come down from there and come near the sepulcher.
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	37	But that stone which had been thrust against the door, having rolled by itself, wenta distance off the side; and the sepulcher opened, and both the young men entered.
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	38	And so those soldiers, having seen, awakened the centurion and the elders (forthey too were present, safeguarding).
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	39	And while they were relating what they had seen, again they see three males whohave come out from they sepulcher, with the two supporting the other one, and a crossfollowing them,
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	40	and the head of the two reaching unto heaven, but that of the one being led out bya hand by them going beyond the heavens.
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	41	And they were hearing a voice from the heavens saying, 'Have you made proclamation to the fallen-asleep?'
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	42	And an obeisance was heard from the cross, 'Yes.'
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	43	And so those people were seeking a common perspective to go off and make thesethings clear to Pilate;
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	44	and while they were still considering it through, there appear again the openedheavens and a certain man having come down and entered into the burial place.
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	45	Having seen these things, those around the centurion hastened at night beforePilate (having left the sepulcher which they were safeguarding) and described all thethings that they indeed had seen, agonizing greatly and saying: 'Truly he was God'sSon.'
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	46	In answer Pilate said: 'I am clean of the blood of the Son of God, but it was to you that this seemed the thing to do.'
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	47	Then all, having come forward, were begging and exhorting him to command thecenturion and the soldiers to say to no one what they had seen.
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	48	'For,' they said, 'it is better for us to owe the debt of the greatest sin in the sight ofGod than to fall into the hands of the Jewish people and be stoned.'
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	49	And so Pilate ordered the centurion and the soldiers to say nothing.
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	50	Now at the dawn of the Lord'sDay Mary Magdalene, a female disciple of the Lord(who, afraid because of the Jews since they were inflamed with anger, had not done atthe tomb of the Lord what women were accustomed to do for the dead beloved bythem),
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	51	having taken with her women friends, came to the tomb where he had been placed.
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	52	And they were afraid lest the Jews should see them and were saying, 'If indeed onthat day on which he was crucified we could not weep and beat ourselves, yet now athis tomb we may do these things.
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	53	But who will roll away for us even the stone placed against the door of the tomb inorder that, having entered, we may sit beside him and do the expected things?
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	54	For the stone was large, and we were afraid lest anyone see us. And if we areunable, let is throw against the door what we bring in memory of him; let us weep andbeat ourselves until we come to our homes.'
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	55	And having gone off, they found the sepulcher opened. And having come forward,they bent down there and saw there a certain young man seated in the middle of thesepulcher, comely and clothed with a splendid robe, who said to them:
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	56	'Why have you come? Whom do you seek? Not that one who was crucified? He isrisen and gone away. But if you do not believe, bend down and see the place where helay, because he is not here. For he is risen and gone away to there whence he wassent.'
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	57	Then the women fled frightened.
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	58	Now it was the final day of the Unleavened Bread; and many went out returning totheir home since the feast wasover.
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	59	But we twelve disciples of the Lord were weeping and sorrowful; and each one,sorrowful because of what had come to pass, departed to his home.
GospelOfPeter	GPeter	1	1	60	But I, Simon Peter, and my brother Andrew, having taken our nets, went off to thesea. And there was with us Levi of Alphaeus whom the Lord ...END
