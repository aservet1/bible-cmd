<h2 align="center">Rules and Expectations for Users</h2>

<p>The jist of all of this is to just follow common sense and be a decent person that is considerate of other human beings.</p>

<ol>
<li>Don't talk about fight club.</li>
<li>Don't talk about fight club.</li>
<li>Don't be an ass. This includes:</li>
	<ul type="square">
	<li>Starting arguments just to start arguments.</li>
	<li>Making fun of someone's post or response. You can 		disagree with people, but don't do it just to validate 	your self-worth because you're insecure about having been 	bullied for your ideas in middle school.</li>
	<li>Being a donkey. No descendants of the wild ass, <i>Equss africanus</i>, allowed on this site.</li>
	</ul>
<li>Be on topic.</li> 
	<ul type="square">
	<li>Don't irrelevantly chat with your friends or start 	talking about something else mid-thread.</li>
	<li>No conversation hijacking. You can start your own 	thread if you need to talk about something separate.</li>
	<li>If you want to relate the topic to a story from your own life, do so to be helpful but not as an excuse to babble about how cool your life is. Keep your personal stories relevant in your responses.
	</ul>
<li>Don't link to viruses or anything that could possibly contain viruses.</li>
<li>Don't link to anything sketchy or illegal.</li>
<li>I'm not gonna make any rules about being racist, sexist, homophobic or any other kind of offensive, but don't complain when everyone hates you for saying terrible things.</li>
<li>Don't be an ass.</li>
</ol>

<p>Failure to follow the rules doesn't <i>necessarily</i> mean getting kicked off the site (depending on the severity of your actions), but there are social consequences to being a problematic individual, sometimes as simple as getting flamed, other times more severe like getting kicked off and having your name written in the Death Note.</p>
