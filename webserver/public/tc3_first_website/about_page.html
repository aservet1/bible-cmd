<h1 align="center">Welcome to Gristelberg's God-Dang Gosh Golly Grand Ol' Forums!<h1>

<h3>Purpose of the site</h3>

<p>The purpose of this site is for our users to be able to discuss whatever topics they need to. If you want to plan an event, get life advice, brainstorm solutions to a problem, or anything else that requires discussion, you can do so here.</p>

<h3>Who can use the site?</h3>

<p>As you know, access to this website requires a password. It was the password that you used to get in. That is the only password for the site and whoever has it can theoretically post on here. If it looks like someone is on the site but nobody gave them the password, then contact me (contact info below) and I will have the password changed and will notify everyone who is still allowed to use the site.</p>
<p>If there is a member that needs to be removed because they're causing problems, we will do this by changing the password and notifying everyone else. The member will no longer be able to log in after that.</p>
<p>Only the site's owner can change the password and makes the final call about it. If you have any questions (password change requests, members to remove, suspicious activity that requires a change, etc) let me know at the email lsited below.</p>
<p>You can give out the password to anyone. Just use common sense about whether the person would work well in the group or just ruin things for everyone and need to be kicked out. It's annoying to have to reset the password and tell everybody.</p> <div><b>So help me <i>God</i> if one of you allows some random sketchy person that you met on the internet on to this site. I will find you and kill you if your idiocy gets a virus on to my page.</b></div>

<h3>How does the site work?</h3>

<p>It's pretty straightforward. It's a forum. If you want to make a discussion topic of any kind, you start a thread. Make sure you title it and put your name and e-mail in it. The name is so we know who you are and the e-mail is if someone wants to 1. send you a personal message and 2. so I know how to contact everyone in the event of a password change. Of course you can choose to not put either, say you want to ask something anonymously, but it's there for everyone's benefit. Responding to answers is also the same. Click the respond button, type in your name, your e-mail, and what your response is.</p>
